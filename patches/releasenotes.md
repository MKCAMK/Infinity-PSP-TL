Release Notes
-------------

## Version 2.0

- Fixed all crashes in TIPS! Don't be paranoid about opening every other tip any more!
- Enhanced digit glyphs in the game font. Digits 2-9 will now look just as crisp, as the rest of the characters. ("0" and "1" were ok since v1.0beta)
- Decreased spacing for whitespace and comma. Text will be a little bit more dense now.
- The scene text preprocessing script was rewritten, which should fix minor inconsistencies in text formatting.


## Version 1.0b

- All in-game texts work.
- Translated most essential menus.
- Important! TIPS are translated, but some of them may crash the game! (Reason: screen buffer overflow, game can display max 480 characters at a time.)
- Modified latin letters and punctuation in the game font to be brighter and sharper, tweaked the width, but still look like the original one.
- Hack for line breaks: lines will not break before latin letters, punctuation and some other symbols.
