Yuka「U... Ugh...」%K%P

0x104
I-It's freezing...%K%P

0x110
Yuka「Mmmmm...」%K%P

0x11C
Yuka「...Hmm?」%K%P

0x130
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x13C
My head feels cloudy, and my eyesight is blurry...%K%P

0x18C
Before long, my vision begins to clear up... I finally reach%Nthe point where I'm able to perceive my surroundings.%K%P

0x198
The lights in the room are still on. It seems like I dozed off%Nwithout realizing it...%K%P

0x1A4
I slept on top of the covers, which is why I woke up%Nchilled to the bone.%K%P

0x1B0
I can hear the sound of the rainfall outside.%K%P

0x1BC
The downpour gets more and more intense...%K%P

0x1C8
I tilt my head to look at the clock.%K%P

0x1D4
It's past 4:30.%K%P

0x1E0
(I'll just go back to sleep...)%K%P

0x1EC
I get up and walk over to the light switch to turn off the%Nlights.%K%P

0x1F8
And then, I stop when I see the purple bottle I placed on%Nthe floor.%K%P

0x204
It's the lilac fragrance I received from Saki.%K%P

0x210
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x21C
I'll go see Saki once morning comes...%K%P

0x228
I'll meet with her one more time and talk... and then...%K%P

0x234
...And then...%K%P

0x240
...%K%P

0x24C
Because I'm half asleep, my brain cells aren't functioning%Nproperly...%K%P

0x258
Either way, it seems that today's going to be a busy day.%K%P

0x264
Yuka「...For now, I'll just sleep...」%K%P

0x270
—Click.%K%P

0x284
(I'll just get some good sleep, then think about it when I%Nwake up...)%K%P

0x290
As I tell myself this, I get back on my bed...%K%P

0x2C0
...Just as I feel myself slipping into unconsciousness...%K%P

0x2F4
A clamorous sound suddenly echoes.%K%P

0x348
I jump to my feet, and look towards the door...%K%P

0x35C
(I-Izumi-san...?)%K%P

0x368
Izumi「Kurumi's...」%K%P

0x374
Izumi「Kurumi's gone!」%K%P

0x3E8
We've all gathered in the living room, an unusual sight.%K%P

0x3F4
Saki... and Makoto are here.%K%P

0x400
Saki is standing with a grim expression...%K%P

0x40C
Makoto is sitting in a dining chair with an absent-minded%Nexpression...%K%P

0x418
I want to go talk with them, but now's not the time for that!%K%P

0x424
My utmost attention is focused on Izumi-san.%K%P

0x438
Izumi「I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night... and when I%Nlooked around...」%K%P

0x454
Saki「Kurumi-chan was gone...」%K%P

0x460
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x46C
Izumi「I searched alone at first, trying all the places I could%Nthink of...」%K%P

0x478
Izumi「Inside the shop, the area around Moon Beach, all of it...」%K%P

0x484
Saki「Do you know of any other places Kurumi-chan would go?」%K%P

0x490
Saki「Or do you have any clues...?」%K%P

0x49C
Izumi-san closes her eyes and softly shakes her head.%K%P

0x4B0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x4BC
This conversation... I've definitely had this conversation%Nbefore...%K%P

0x4C8
Yes... this is...%K%P

0x4D4
This conversation happened in the last loop, when%NKurumi-chan went missing...%K%P

0x4E0
(...!!!)%K%P

0x4EC
(If that's the case... if that's the case!)%K%P

0x4F8
My whole body starts shivering...%K%P

0x560
—A flashback dashes through my mind!%K%P

0x56C
My memories are showing me a vivid image of that%Nscene...!!%K%P

0x578
The image of Kurumi-chan sitting down... in that dim%Nshrine...!!!%K%P

0x5C8
(Wh-Why...? Why...!?)%K%P

0x5D4
(I don't... I don't understand why...)%K%P

0x5E0
A sharp pain starts running through my head.%K%P

0x5EC
Right now, I'm so confused that I can't think straight.%K%P

0x5F8
I slowly look up at the clock.%K%P

0x604
It's almost... 5:00...%K%P

0x610
Today is April 6th...%K%P

0x61C
The 6th...%K%P

0x628
5:00... on the 6th...%K%P

0x63C
"Then no matter what happens, history wouldn't change."%K%P

0x648
"Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning."%K%P

0x654
Even though we planned to change it...%K%P

0x660
The truth is, nothing has changed...%K%P

0x66C
Aside from some very minor things, nothing... has%Nchanged...%K%P

0x678
Saki「Anyway, sitting still here won't get anything solved...」%K%P

0x684
Saki「...Why don't we all quickly split up and look for Kurumi?」%K%P

0x690
...It feels like her voice is coming from somewhere far, far%Naway.%K%P

0x69C
...%K%P

0x6E8
A sudden sound brings me back to reality.%K%P

0x710
Saki「Hold on, Makoto-kun! Where are you going!?」%K%P

0x71C
At that moment, I see... Makoto rushing out the front door!%K%P

0x728
—Wham!%K%P

0x734
In that instant, it feels like all the blood in my body has%Nbeen drained away.%K%P

0x740
It can't be...!%K%P

0x74C
It can't be, it can't be...!%K%P

0x758
My body moves faster than I can think.%K%P

0x794
Saki「...Huh!? Y-Yuka!?」%K%P

0x7A8
I rush out into the downpour, chasing after Makoto as%Nfast as I can.%K%P

0x824
I go flying through the cold, large raindrops.%K%P

0x830
I see Makoto far ahead of me, sprinting as fast as I am,%Nwith all of his might.%K%P

0x83C
The muddy ground constantly trips me up.%K%P

0x848
Even so, I don't slow down, and continue to run fiercely.%K%P

0x854
I've... I've got to stop Makoto!%K%P

0x860
I know where he's going.%K%P

0x86C
To... that shrine!%K%P

0x878
At this rate... at this rate...!%K%P

0x884
It won't just be Kurumi, but Makoto as well...!!%K%P

0x890
I bellow as loud as I can.%K%P

0x89C
Yuka「MAKOTO! MAKOTO!」%K%P

0x8A8
...%K%P

0x8B4
But Makoto doesn't turn around...%K%P

0x924
We come out to the coastline.%K%P

0x930
It feels like the rain has gotten even stronger.%K%P

0x93C
My whole body is soaked, and my arms and legs have%Ngone numb.%K%P

0x948
Soon, we'll reach the T-junction that leads to the shrine.%K%P

0x954
If I reach that shrine, then there's no doubt that history%Nwill repeat itself.%K%P

0x960
But...%K%P

0x96C
But that doesn't matter right now!%K%P

0x978
All I want to do is to stop Makoto from going to the shrine.%K%P

0x984
—The earthquake will cause the ground to shake.%K%N

0x990
—The shrine will collapse.%K%N

0x99C
—And we'll be sqaushed by the debris...%K%P

0x9A8
(I can't let that happen...! Absolutely not!!)%K%P

0x9B4
I clench my teeth to make that horrible scene go away.%K%P

0x9C0
(We'll return to the free world...!)%K%P

0x9CC
(We'll see the sunrise of the 7th together...!)%K%P

0x9D8
Yuka「—That's right, we promised each other!!!」%K%P

0xA10
I've reached the long staircase that leads up to the%Nshrine—%K%P

0xA1C
I've finally caught up to Makoto.%K%P

0xA44
Yuka「Wait!」%K%P

0xA50
I grab Makoto's arm, then slip around so that I'm in front%Nof him...%K%P

0xAD4
...I stand in front of the staircase, and spread my arms.%K%P

0xAE0
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0xAEC
Yuka「Don't go!」%K%P

0xAF8
Yuka「Please... don't go!」%K%P

0xB04
Makoto「Kurumi's... Kurumi's in this shrine.」%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「So I've got... to go...」%K%P

0xB1C
Makoto「I've got... to save Kurumi...」%K%P

0xB28
I know that.%K%P

0xB34
I want to save Kurumi-chan too...%K%P

0xB40
But...!%K%P

0xB4C
Yuka「No! I absolutely can't let you... Absolutely not...」%K%P

0xB58
I understand.%K%P

0xB64
The one that Makoto is trying to save isn't just Kurumi.%K%P

0xB70
Makoto「Get out of the way, Yuka... There's no time...」%K%P

0xB7C
Just like last time, he's trying to protect me.%K%P

0xB88
Just like he swore he would under that starry sky...%K%P

0xB94
Yuka「If you go in there, things will turn out the same way%Nagain...!」%K%P

0xBA0
Yuka「Nothing will change...」%K%P

0xBAC
Yuka「We won't be able to return to the free world!」%K%P

0xBB8
Makoto「Yeah... I know...」%K%P

0xBC4
Makoto「Certainly, that much is true right now...」%K%P

0xBD0
Makoto「But...」%K%P

0xBDC
Makoto takes something out of his pocket.%K%P

0xBE8
It's his bell, the one Kurumi found at Moon Beach on the%N3rd...%K%P

0xC10
He... drops the bell... on the ground.%K%P

0xC1C
And then...%K%P

0xC28
Yuka「...Huh?」%K%P

0xC50
...With all of his strength, he stomps on it.%K%P

0xC78
...%K%P

0xC84
All that's left are shattered, small metal pieces.%K%P

0xC90
They're shining in a puddle...%K%P

0xC9C
In other words, out of his own free will...%K%P

0xCA8
...Makoto has just severed the thread of his life.%K%P

0xCC0
Makoto「...This is the end.」%K%P

0xCCC
Yuka「...Makoto...」%K%P

0xCD8
Makoto「I can't go back again...」%K%P

0xCE4
Makoto「I can't... go back to the past...」%K%P

0xCF0
Makoto「I will end... everything here...」%K%P

0xD0C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xD18
Makoto's words wring my heart.%K%P

0xD24
I can't go back to the past...%K%P

0xD30
So... in other words...?%K%P

0xD44
Yuka「No...」%K%P

0xD50
Yuka「I don't want that!」%K%P

0xD5C
The desperation I've been able to hold back up until now%Ncomes pouring out.%K%P

0xD68
Yuka「No more... I don't... want this!」%K%P

0xD74
—This feeling definitely isn't anger.%K%P

0xD80
Yuka「I don't want to lose... another precious person!」%K%P

0xD8C
—On the other hand, it's not sadness.%K%P

0xD98
Yuka「I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0xDA4
—Nor is it pity, misery, or compassion.%K%P

0xDB0
Yuka「You went as far... as risking your own life... trying to%Nsave... mine...」%K%P

0xDBC
—It's just my plain feelings for Makoto at the bottom%Nof my heart...%K%P

0xDC8
Yuka「Please... please...」%K%P

0xDD4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xDE0
Without a word, he brushes past my shoulder, and walks%Npast me.%K%P

0xDEC
The time it takes for him to pass by me feels long, like it's%Nin slow motion.%K%P

0xDF8
In that slow motion moment...%K%P

0xE04
I look at his eyes as he passes by me.%K%P

0xE10
They're swelling with determination.%K%P

0xE1C
Where have I seen... eyes that resemble those before...?%K%P

0xE30
—In that instant, a certain scene that I remember is%Nreflected before my eyes.%K%P

0xE3C
A scene dyed in orange...%K%P

0xE48
It's of that boy, at that time...%K%P

0xE54
At that place...%K

0x2228
In front of the burning hotel.

0x2234
In the art room after school.

0xE9C
I was watching the flames blow up from the windows of%Nthe 3rd floor of that burning hotel.%K%P

0xEA8
That image from that dark night that looked like a%Ndepiction of hell...%K%P

0xEB4
Someone was glaring at that hotel.%K%P

0xEC0
...It was him.%K%P

0xECC
If you were to follow his glance, you could see someone%Nat the windows on the 4th floor.%K%P

0xED8
There was a person still trapped inside.%K%P

0xEE4
At that moment, the boy boldly plunged into the hellfire.%K%P

0xEF0
The one left behind in that fire...%K ... was definitely me...%K%P

0xEFC
Tears well up in my eyes.%K%P

0xF08
Gradually, the scenery before me shifts and warps...%K%P

0xF94
While my overflowing tears are pouring out...%K%P

0xFA0
I'm still at the foot of the shrine's staircase...%K%P

0xFAC
I see Makoto running up the staircase.%K%P

0xFB8
The pouring rain brings me back to my senses.%K%P

0xFC4
Yuka「Makoto!!」%K%P

0xFEC
I wipe my tears away, and chase after him.%K%P

0xFF8
I run as fast as I can up the stairs.%K%P

0x1004
The rain hits me hard, as if it's trying to stop me from%Ngoing.%K%P

0x1010
(I won't let the same history repeat itself... I'll...!)%K%P

0x1074
By the time I reach the top, Makoto is already running%Npast the shrine grounds.%K%P

0x1080
Yuka「WAIT!」%K%P

0x108C
When he hears me, Makoto stops and turns around.%K%P

0x1098
Makoto「Stay away!」%K%P

0x10A4
Makoto「Stay here...」%K%P

0x10B0
...In that instant, Makoto goes running off.%K%P

0x10BC
But I ignore Makoto and run into the shrine.%K%P

0x10C8
Makoto「Yuka!」%K%P

0x10E8
The empty art room.%K%P

0x10F4
The art room after school, before nightfall.%K%P

0x1100
I'd been squinting because of the light from the setting%Nsun coming in through the window.%K%P

0x110C
Before my eyes, someone was drawing in a sketchbook.%K%P

0x1118
...It was that boy.%K%P

0x1124
Before long, he finished his drawing, and presented it to%Nme.%K%P

0x1130
It was a drawing of two doves flying out of the window.%K%P

0x113C
And then...%K%P

0x1148
Boy「If you stay tied down, you can never be free.」%K%P

0x1154
Boy「If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid.」%K%P

0x1160
...He said that, and pointed outside the open window.%K%P

0x11B8
Outside were cherry blossoms in full bloom...%K%P

0x11C4
They fluttered about wondrously, concealing everything%Nin front of them...%K%P

0x1268
The light pink petals transform into transparent drops of%Nrain...%K%P

0x1274
I'm still at the foot of the shrine's staircase...%K%P

0x1280
I see Makoto running up the staircase.%K The pouring rain%Nbrings me back to my senses.%K%P

0x12B4
(N... No... )%K%P

0x12C0
(No ...I don't want this...)%K%P

0x12CC
(I ...If Makoto's going, then I should go in to make sure he%Nstays safe...!)%K%P

0x1300
(——!?)%K%P

0x130C
Suddenly, in the darkness, I see a radiance as bright as%Nthe sun!%K%P

0x1318
I'm not thinking of myself, but being considerate of%NMakoto first!!%K%P

0x1324
In other words, this is...!!%K%P

0x1330
Yuka「Makoto...!!」%K%P

0x133C
I run up to Makoto, and grab him by the arm, pulling him%Ntowards me.%K%P

0x1348
Makoto「...Wha-!? C-Cut it out and get back!」%K%P

0x13BC
Yuka「I love you...」%K%P

0x13C8
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x13D4
Yuka「I've loved you... all this time...」%K%P

0x13E0
Yuka「It's true that I went to this shrine because I couldn't%Nforget that boy. But...」%K%P

0x13EC
Yuka「But I realized it was wrong... That feeling was wrong...」%K%P

0x13F8
Yuka「Makoto, I love you...」%K%P

0x1404
Makoto「...Y- Yu—」%K%P

0x142C
—And then I thrust Makoto away!%K%P

0x1438
Makoto falls behind me, dancing in the air briefly before%Nhitting the ground with a thud.%K%P

0x1444
Yuka「From the beginning, from that moment where everything%Nbegan, I've loved you!!」%K%P

0x146C
...%K%P

0x1478
The pelting rain beats mercilessly from the sky...%K%P

0x1484
While sitting on the ground, Makoto stares up, looking%Ndumbfounded.%K%P

0x1490
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x149C
I've told him my feelings...%K%P

0x14A8
This is enough...%K%P

0x1518
I bite down on my lips hard, then turn around and start%Nrunning up the staircase.%K%P

0x1524
The one to save Kurumi-chan won't be Makoto, but me!%K%P

0x1530
Right now, the one that this weak person known as "me"%Nwants to protect the most... is...%K%P

0x153C
(It's not myself....it's Makoto!!)%K%P

0x1548
I order myself to keep kicking off the stone steps.%K%P

0x1554
Makoto「YUKAAAAAAA!!!!」%K%P

0x1560
Makoto is chasing after me...!%K%P

0x156C
Yuka「Stay away...」%K%P

0x1578
Yuka「Please... stay away!」%K%P

0x1594
Yuka「STAY AWAAAY!!!!」%K%P

0x15A0
My bitter scream breaks through the roar of the rain and%Nechoes loudly...%K%P

0x15D8
With all my strength, I run up the staircase, and step onto%Nthe shrine's grounds.%K%P

0x15E4
And then, without stopping, I run into the shrine with the%Nspeed of a hurricane.%K%P

0x1668
(—What!?)%K%P

0x1674
The shrine is completely empty...%K%P

0x1680
(...No way! Kurumi-chan should've been here!!)%K%P

0x168C
I look around in confusion.%K%P

0x1698
(—!?)%K%P

0x16A4
I can feel a faint draft of wind...%K%P

0x16B0
...Could it be!?%K%P

0x16BC
I move aside the small altar at the front wall, and pass%Nthrough the hole.%K%P

0x16C8
Makoto「Hey! Yuka!」%K%P

0x16D4
I can hear Makoto behind me.%K%P

0x16E0
(This is bad! I've got to hurry!!)%K%P

0x16EC
I go out to the backside of the shrine as fast as I%Ncan—!%K%P

0x1700
However...%K%P

0x170C
(Wh-Why!? What... is this??)%K%P

0x1718
Makoto comes out from the hole in the wall.%K%P

0x1724
And then, he surveys the area, then looks at me.%K%P

0x1730
Kurumi's not here either...%K%P

0x173C
Makoto is looking at me with curious eyes...%K%P

0x1748
Mine are probably the same...%K%P

0x1798
...Before long, the earth begins to violently shake.%K%P

0x17A4
Our time limit's up——.%K%P

0x17B0
Those words flash through my mind.%K%P

0x17BC
I put my hand into my pocket, looking for the bell...%K%P

0x17C8
...Wait, "bell"?%K%P

0x17D4
...Makoto!?%K%P

0x17E0
Makoto's here, but he has no bell!!!%K%P

0x17EC
The tremors increase in intensity.%K%P

0x1814
Overhead, small splinters are falling, the wooden%Nstructure collasping.%K%P

0x1820
I look behind me, and see Makoto staring at this with wide%Neyes.%K%P

0x1874
(————!!!)%K%P

0x1880
Althogh I can't think anymore, there's still one thought in%Nmy head...%K%P

0x188C
Just one single firm thought!%K%P

0x18B8
I wish...%K%P

0x18CC
I wish...%K

0x2240
For us to be together forever...!

0x224C
For a miracle to happen once more...!

0x190C
"We'll be together forever...!"%K%P

0x1918
I take out the bell, and grasp it tightly.%K%P

0x1948
Yuka「I'll go with you too...」%K%P

0x1954
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x1960
...And just like that...%K%P

0x196C
...I...%K%P

0x1978
...throw the bell...%K%P

0x1984
...into the sea...%K%P

0x19F4
At the same time, I hear the sound of the shrine%Ncrumbling...%K%P

0x1A00
With this...%K%P

0x1A0C
Everything is over...%K%P

0x1A18
—At that time, Makoto fiercely lunges forward!%K%P

0x1A34
He grabs me, pushes down on the ground and jumps...%K%P

0x1A40
...With that force, we flutter around up in mid-air.%K%P

0x1A4C
Makoto and I embrace each other as we fall down%Ntowards the black sea...%K%P

0x1A90
...I see a shooting star.%K%P

0x1A9C
That star of hope makes a clear sound...%K%P

0x1AC4
And finally, I lose consciousness—.%K%P

0x1B40
...%K%P

0x1B4C
...%K%P

0x1B58
—I'm in a black space.%K%P

0x1B64
—There, I find a fragment of my memories.%K%P

0x1B70
—A memory of that far off day, when I looked at that%Nclear sky and heard the story about the twins...%K%P

0x1B7C
"The two of them were so close that they were always%Ntogether, no matter what time."%K%P
