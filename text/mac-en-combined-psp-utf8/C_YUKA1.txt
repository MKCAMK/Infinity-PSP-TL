As I wake up, I kick the covers off the bed with all my%Nstrength.%K%P

0x80
Still half asleep, I blankly stare into space.%K%P

0x8C
It's a familiar... ceiling...%K%P

0x98
I realize I'm freezing, my body soaked with sweat all over.%K%P

0xA4
I take a deep breath and slowly exhale.%K%P

0xB0
The warm scent of wood goes through my nose and fills%Nmy head.%K%P

0xBC
It takes me three more breaths until...%K%P

0xC8
Yuka「Huh...?」%K%P

0xD4
Yuka「T-This is...」%K%P

0xE0
Yuka「The lodge...」%K%P

0xEC
Yuka「...This is the lodge!」%K%P

0x114
(There's no mistaking it...)%K%P

0x120
(This is... my room.)%K%P

0x12C
(If that's the case... if that's the case, then...)%K%P

0x148
(—!!!!)%K%P

0x15C
I leap out of my bed and rush out of my room like a%Nspeeding bullet.%K%P

0x168
My target is...%K%P

0x190
...the door before my eyes, which I violently force open.%K%P

0x1A4
"He" is standing in the center of the room.%K%P

0x1B0
It seems like "he's" only just woken up... "He" turns%Naround, still wearing "his" nightclothes.%K%P

0x1BC
It feels like my heart is tightly crushed.%K%P

0x1C8
Even though I've only run a short distance, my heart is%Nviolently thumping inside my chest.%K%P

0x1D4
Before long...%K%N

0x1E0
Before long...%K%P

0x230
Before long, "his" eyes notice me.%K%P

0x23C
(M-Makoto...)%K%P

0x248
Makoto is standing right there.%K%P

0x254
The Makoto I spent six days with...%K%P

0x260
The Makoto who looks exactly the same as he did in my%Nmemories of that day...%K%P

0x26C
(Makoto...)%K%P

0x278
I try to say this, but...%K%P

0x284
Yuka「Wh... What's going on!?」%K%P

0x290
He is taken aback by my words.%K%P

0x29C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2A8
Yuka「Why...!?」%K%P

0x2B4
...I continue to ask him.%K%P

0x2C0
I can't process the impossibility that is right before my%Neyes.%K%P

0x2CC
Running through my head are the countless things I want%Nto ask him.%K%P

0x2D8
Even so...%K%P

0x2F4
Even so, no more words will come out...%K%P

0x300
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x318
Makoto...%K Makoto...?%K He's... all right?%K%P

0x32C
(...Huh?)%K%P

0x338
It happens almost instantly.%K%P

0x344
Makoto's body moves as if it's floating... and he%Nembraces me.%K%P

0x350
He holds me tightly...%K%P

0x35C
It's as if he wants to keep me here, in order to tie me to%Nthis place.%K%P

0x368
Yuka「Ma... Makoto...」%K%P

0x374
In turn, I tightly embrace Makoto.%K%P

0x380
His warmth seeps into my body. My ears are filled with%Nthe sounds of our heartbeats.%K%P

0x38C
It's a strong, strong reassurance, the proof that we are%Nalive.%K%P

0x398
Yuka「Then did we... did we...」%K%P

0x3AC
When Makoto tears his body off of me, he slowly raises%Nhis left hand.%K%P

0x3B8
I lean in close as we both look at his watch's face.%K%P

0x3C4
"1st MON 9:19 A.M."%K%P

0x3D0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3DC
Makoto「Somehow...」%K%P

0x3E8
Makoto「...It seems to be that way. In other words, we-」%K%P

0x3FC
Before he can finish talking, I plunge into Makoto's chest.%K%P

0x408
The impact knocks him back to the wall as he staggers%Non his feet.%K%P

0x414
Even so, I press myself against him.%K%P

0x444
I bury my face in Makoto's chest while... crying.%K%P

0x450
I grasp his shirt tightly while various torrents of%Nemotions within me pour out one by one.%K%P

0x45C
Yuka「...Makoto... Makoto...」%K%P

0x468
I continue to whisper this.%K I'm trying to confirm that he's%Nright here, before my eyes...%K%P

0x474
I say this countless times...%K ...countless times.%K%P

0x480
Makoto「It's all right, it's all right...」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「I'm... right here...」%K%P

0x498
I'm crying so much that I've begun hiccuping.%K%P

0x4A4
The sound of my unleased weeping reaches my ears.%K%P

0x4B0
Yes, my weeping, filled with joy, sadness, love, anger,%Nand relief... Emotions with names that I don't know... they%Ncome endlessly, flooding out of me like water from a%Nfaucet whose stopper has been broken.%K%P

0x4BC
Then I feel something touch the back of my hair.%K%P

0x4F4
Whiffs of a somewhat nostalgic scent tickle my nose...%K%P

0x500
It's Makoto's... scent.%K%P

0x50C
It's... a smell filled with peace and kindness...%K%P

0x560
About an hour passes until my tears dry up and my hot%Neyelids finally cool down.%K%P

0x56C
My mind has already completely regained its composure.%K%P

0x578
That outburst of tears may have just been me rinsing%Noff my heart, so to speak.%K%P

0x584
Makoto「Yuka... I have to confirm something with you...」%K%P

0x590
Makoto「Do you also remember everything from before?」%K%P

0x59C
Makoto「Do you remember what happened to us?」%K%P

0x5A8
I nod.%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「Then you didn't forget anything else before that, right?%NWhat happened in the past six days, that is...?」%K%P

0x5C8
Yuka「No, I remember...」%K%P

0x5D4
Yuka「The taste of Izumi-san's paella...」%K%P

0x5E0
Yuka「Saki almost drowning at the pier...」%K%P

0x5EC
Yuka「The shock I felt from learning Haruka was a clone...」%K%P

0x5F8
Yuka「Kurumi-chan's disappearance, and then finding her at%Nthe shrine...」%K%P

0x604
Yuka「Now that I think about it, that might have been when all of%Nthis began...」%K%P

0x610
Yuka「If we hadn't gone to the shrine back then...」%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x630
Yuka「I also remember that night too...」%K%P

0x63C
Yuka「When you and I... looked at the starry sky... that night...」%K%P

0x648
The vow made that night...%K The vow Makoto made to%Nprotect me...%K%P

0x65C
Yuka「It looks like we've gone back to the starting point.」%K%P

0x668
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x674
Yuka「But I wonder... is that really true?」%K%P

0x680
Makoto「...Huh?」%K%P

0x68C
Yuka「Well, perhaps your watch might be malfunctioning.」%K%P

0x698
Yuka「We can't be certain from the watch alone.」%K%P

0x6A4
Yuka「We've got to confirm it from other sources.」%K%P

0x6B0
Makoto「...Confirm it?」%K%P

0x6C4
I walk briskly to front of the door, and lightly grasp the%Ndoorknob.%K%P

0x6D0
Yuka「If we really time traveled...」%K%P

0x6DC
Makoto「...H-Hold on!」%K%P

0x6F0
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x6FC
Makoto「Don't tell me that you're planning to tell Haruka and%NOkuhiko everything?」%K%P

0x708
Yuka「No way...」%K%P

0x714
Yuka「I think it'd be best if we still kept this quiet.」%K%P

0x720
Yuka「So pretend like nothing's happened and act like your%Nusual self...」%K%P

0x72C
Yuka「Anyway, our first priority right now is to confirm the date...」%K%P

0x738
Yuka「...Even if we talk afterwards, it won't be too late, right?」%K%P

0x768
I venture out into the living room, with Makoto following%Nclose behind me.%K%P

0x7C4
Yuka「Good morning!」%K%P

0x7D0
I do the best I can to act like my usual self.%K%P

0x7EC
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x7F8
Okuhiko-kun is sitting down on the sofa next to Haruka.%K%P

0x804
There's about 50 cm between him and Haruka.%K%P

0x810
I hesitate for a second, then decide that it would be%Nbest to just be blunt about this.%K%P

0x824
Yuka「Hey, Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0x830
Yuka「What's today's date again?」%K%P

0x844
Okuhiko「Huh!? Hey, hey, what's wrong, Yuka-chan? Did you hit%Nyour head?」%K%P

0x850
Yuka「H-Hmm... Lately, I've been awfully forgetful...」%K%P

0x864
Okuhiko「Forgetful, huh... I didn't think you were that ditzy...」%K%P

0x870
Okuhiko「Oh well...」%K%P

0x884
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara? Do this young lady a favor and tell her.」%K%P

0x898
(—!?)%K%P

0x8A4
Makoto「H-Huh!? ...T-Tell her what!?」%K%P

0x8B0
Okuhiko「Today's date, obviously!」%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto gets extremely flustered.%K It feels like everything%Ncould all fall apart at once...%K%P

0x8C8
(Th-This is... bad... What should I do?)%K%P

0x8D4
And so I...%K

0x60D0
Ask Okuhiko-kun again.

0x60DC
Leave it to Makoto.

0x60E8
Answer myself.

0x60F4
Stop Makoto from talking.

0x93C
Yuka「Okuhiko-kun? I only asked you, didn't I?」%K%P

0x948
I glare at Okuhiko-kun.%K%P

0x95C
Okuhiko「Huh?」%K%P

0x968
Yuka「I want you to answer, Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0x974
Okuhiko「...Yuka-chan, did something happen? You seem to be in a%Nreally bad mood...」%K%P

0x988
Yuka「It doesn't matter, just answer me!」%K%P

0x99C
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x9A8
Okuhiko「I-I get it... I'll answer, so there's no need to get so mad...」%K%P

0x9B4
Okuhiko「Today is...」%K%P

0x9C0
Okuhiko「Monday, April 1st...」%K%P

0x9D4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x9E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9F4
Yuka「Y-Yeah... Of course. Right, right, right, right...」%K%P

0xA08
Okuhiko「Ha ha, isn't that obvious?」%K%P

0xA1C
Okuhiko「Forgetting the date on the first day of the Camp... are%Nyou really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0xA28
Okuhiko「And on top of that, you're in kinda a bad mood.」%K%P

0xA3C
Yuka「Ah, sorry. It's just that Makoto's so unreliable that he%Nwas kinda pissing me off.」%K%P

0xA48
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA5C
Okuhiko「Ha ha ha... Now that you mention it, you might be right.」%K%P

0xA70
Yuka「Aren't I? Ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...」%K%P

0xA7C
I decide to fake a laugh.%K%P

0xA98
(I'll just hope that Makoto is a good liar...)%K%P

0xAA4
I give a little prayer on this thought.%K%P

0xAB0
Makoto「R-Right... today's date? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...」%K%P

0xABC
Makoto「You must be seriously ill to forget something like that,%Nhuh?」%K%P

0xAC8
Makoto「Right, Haruka?」%K%P

0xAE4
Haruka「She's probably... still half-asleep.」%K%P

0xAF0
Makoto「Yes, I see, you might be right.」%K%P

0xAFC
My prayers have been answered, as it seems that%NMakoto has successfully managed to indirectly turn the%Nquestion over to Haruka...%K%P

0xB08
Haruka「Today is... Monday, April 1st.」%K%P

0xB1C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xB28
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB3C
Yuka「A-Ah... A-Ah... r-r-r-r-r-r-right, of course!」%K%P

0xB48
Yuka「What am I saying...?」%K%P

0xB64
Okuhiko「Forgetting the date on the first day of the Camp... Are%Nyou really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0xB78
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0xB84
I decide to fake a laugh.%K%P

0xB98
Okuhiko「I can just tell it's going to be hard going... Hang in there,%Nleader.」%K%P

0xBB4
Yuka「A-Ah... I remember now!」%K%P

0xBC0
Worried about what could happen, I cut into the%Nconversation and say this.%K%P

0xBD4
Yuka「Today's Monday, April 1st, right?」%K%P

0xBE8
Okuhiko「Ha ha, isn't that obvious?」%K%P

0xBFC
Okuhiko「Forgetting the date on the first day of the Camp... are%Nyou really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0xC10
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0xC1C
I decide to fake a laugh.%K%P

0xC30
Okuhiko「I can just tell it's going to be hard going... Hang in there,%Nleader.」%K%P

0xC54
(Makoto! Sorry about this!!)%K%P

0xC60
I rush over to Makoto, and smash his flank with my elbow.%K%P

0xC88
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0xCB0
He lets out a wordless scream as he somersaults while%Ncollapsing to the ground.%K%P

0xCBC
He then holds his side while moaning in pain.%K%P

0xCD0
Yuka「Huh? What's wrong, Makoto? Was it a difficult question?」%K%P

0xCEC
Okuhiko「Y-Yuka... chan?」%K%P

0xD00
Yuka「Hmm... it seems like Makoto can't answer, so please%Nanswer for him, Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0xD14
Okuhiko「Yuka-chan? I may not be Ishihara's biggest fan, but%Neven I know what I saw just no-」%K%P

0xD28
Yuka「Answer the question!」%K%P

0xD3C
Okuhiko「Y-Yes, ma'am!」%K%P

0xD48
Okuhiko「Today is... Monday... April 1st.」%K%P

0xD5C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xD68
Okuhiko「A-Are you not pleased by that...?」%K%P

0xD7C
Yuka「...Huh? A-Ah... I remember now!」%K%P

0xD88
Yuka「...Of course. Right, right, right, right...」%K%P

0xD9C
Okuhiko「Y-Yeah... Forgetting the date on the first day of the%NCamp... Are you really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0xDB0
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0xDBC
I decide to fake a laugh.%K%P

0xE00
...Our guess was right after all.%K%P

0xE0C
Today is Monday, April 1st —Makoto's watch was%Ncorrect.%K%P

0xE18
...In that case...%K%P

0xE2C
Yuka「Ah!」%K%P

0xE40
Yuka「Come on, Makoto!」%K%P

0xE4C
I point to the terrace.%K%P

0xE58
And then...%K%P

0xE7C
Against his will, I force the cowering Makoto off the floor,%Nand drag him to the terrace...%K%P

0xE90
I don't hear a reply from Makoto, so I grab his hand, and%Nlead him towards the terrace...%K%P

0xF10
Makoto「Wh-What is it, Yuka? Is there something here?」%K%P

0xF24
Yuka「Of course not! Why would there be?」%K%P

0xF30
Makoto「Then why...?」%K%P

0xF44
Yuka「Because I don't want them to overhear us.」%K%P

0xF50
Makoto「Ah... so that was it?」%K%P

0xF5C
Yuka「Geez, you're so thickheaded...」%K%P

0xF68
Makoto「...So what should we do? We've confirmed that today is%Nthe 1st, but...」%K%P

0xF74
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0xF80
Makoto「Wouldn't it be best to tell them everything after all?」%K%P

0xF94
Yuka「We can't!」%K%P

0xFA0
Makoto「Why not?」%K%P

0xFAC
Yuka「There's no time right now. I'll tell you later.」%K%P

0xFB8
Yuka「If we spend too much time here, they may get suspicious%Nof us...」%K%P

0xFDC
Yuka「For now, just act normally.」%K%P

0xFE8
Makoto「Look who's talking. You were completely ridiculous back%Nthen!」%K%P

0xFF4
Makoto「My body is still crying in pain.」%K%P

0x1000
Yuka「Geez, I'm sorry about that, okay...?」%K%P

0x100C
Yuka「Anyway, act normal... Okay? Do you understand?」%K%P

0x1028
Yuka「For now, can you act like you usually do, like you did just%Nnow?」%K%P

0x1034
Makoto「But-」%K%P

0x1048
Yuka「It's fine! Just do what I say!」%K%P

0x1054
Yuka「Anyway, act normal... Okay? Do you understand?」%K%P

0x10DC
Okuhiko「Was there something on the terrace?」%K%P

0x10F8
Yuka「Yeah, a bush warbler. It was perched on the railing...」%K%P

0x1104
I tell a quick lie.%K%P

0x1118
Okuhiko「Oh, a bush warbler... Really makes you feel that it's the%Nstart of spring, huh...?」%K%P

0x112C
Yuka「Ah, that's right!」%K%P

0x1138
Yuka「Guys, you haven't had breakfast yet, right?」%K%P

0x1144
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1158
Okuhiko「Yeah. Now that you mention it, my stomach's been%Ngrowling for a while.」%K%P

0x1164
Yuka「Well then, I'll start making something now.」%K%P

0x1180
Makoto「WHAT!?」%K%P

0x1194
Yuka「What, is there something wrong?」%K%P

0x11A0
Makoto「You're damn right there is! I can't let you do that!」%K%P

0x11D0
Yuka「Wh-Why!?」%K%P

0x11DC
Makoto「I don't need to tell you!」%K%P

0x11F0
Yuka「What's your reason!?」%K%P

0x11FC
Makoto「The reason doesn't matter!」%K%P

0x1208
Makoto「In the first place, what do you plan on making!?」%K%P

0x121C
Yuka「...Well, in the fridge, there's eggs, tomatoes, corn beef...」%K%P

0x1228
Yuka「...fermented soybeans, enoki mushrooms, mayonnaise...」%K%P

0x123C
Yuka「...chocolate, ice cream, and muscat jelly, so...」%K%P

0x1250
Yuka「...I'll put it all in a mixer and cook it in a frying pan. What do%Nyou think...?」%K%P

0x125C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1270
Okuhiko「S-Sorry, but... I'll pass...」%K%P

0x128C
Haruka「...M-Me too...」%K%P

0x12A0
Makoto「See what I mean?」%K%P

0x12B4
Yuka「Why!? It'll definitely taste good!」%K%P

0x12C0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x12CC
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x12D8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1304
Yuka「Fine! Then I'll add some toast to it!」%K%P

0x1450
...Unfortunately, I was unable to show off my cooking%Nskills.%K%P

0x145C
A friend of mine once commented that I was "An elite%Ncook whose skills and cooking make everyone run%Naway."%K%P

0x1468
I wanted to have at least Makoto eat it one more time...%K%P

0x1474
...After that, everyone washed their faces, brushed their%Nteeth, and changed their clothes.%K%P

0x1480
With nothing else to do, we decide to watch TV.%K%P

0x148C
Okuhiko turns on the TV in the corner of the room.%K%P

0x1498
Projected on the screen is a small stream flowing.%K%P

0x14A4
Okuhiko quickly changes the channel.%K%P

0x14B0
This time, an image of a cooking show appears.%K%P

0x14BC
In the upper right hand corner of the screen is the title%Nlogo, "A Healthy YOUtopia".%K%P

0x14C8
Okuhiko changes the channel again, but all we see is the%Nriver from earlier.%K%P

0x14D4
Okuhiko「It seems like all they've got is this local broadcasting%Ncrap...」%K%P

0x14E0
Okuhiko changes the channel back to "A Healthy%NYOUtopia".%K%P

0x14F4
Haruka「What should we do... about food?」%K%P

0x1510
Okuhiko「We finally got dressed and everything, so how about%Ngoing out to eat?」%K%P

0x151C
Makoto「No, if we eat now, then we'll just get hungry again too%Nearly in the afternoon, right?」%K%P

0x1528
Makoto「If we're going to go out, then wouldn't it be best to wait a%Nlittle bit? Like, say... another half hour...」%K%P

0x1534
Okuhiko「Well, you've got a point...」%K%P

0x1540
Haruka also gives a nod of agreement.%K%P

0x1554
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x1560
I tilt my head.%K%P

0x156C
Just then, Makoto wordlessly mouths something to me.%NHowever, it's only one syllable, so I don't understand%Nwhat he means. When I shrug my shoulders, Makoto%Nbegins mouthing the letters.%K%P

0x1578
(...T ...H ...A ...T.)%K%P

0x1584
(That?)%K%P

0x1590
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x159C
I don't get it.%K%P

0x15A8
However, I do know that that Makoto is planning%Nsomething.%K%P

0x15B4
It seems he's up to no good...%K%P

0x15C0
Makoto's eyes say it all... They're the eyes of a kid who%Nhas just thought of a prank.%K%P

0x1630
The doorbell rings.%K%P

0x163C
The four of us look towards the front door all at once.%K%P

0x1648
Makoto「Ah, I'll get it.」%K%P

0x1654
He stands straight up, and walks to the door.%K%P

0x1698
He opens the front door.%K%P

0x16A4
When he does, I see...%K%P

0x1710
Kurumi「Thank you for your continued patronage♪」%K%P

0x171C
Kurumi「Here's the seafood pizza you ordered!」%K%P

0x1728
Makoto「Oh, thank you!」%K%P

0x1734
(K-Kurumi-chan...!?)%K%P

0x1740
Now that I think about it, when I first met Kurumi-chan last%Ntime, Makoto said...%K%P

0x174C
"Remember the pizza we ate for lunch? She's the one%Nwho delivered it."%K%P

0x1758
Which means... Is he thinking of...!?%K%P

0x1798
Okuhiko「Huh? Ishihara, when did you order that?」%K%P

0x17A4
Makoto「Huh? O-Oh... earlier.」%K%P

0x17B8
Okuhiko「Earlier?」%K%P

0x17CC
Okuhiko「...Oh, so that's why you said 'it'd be best if we waited half%Nan hour'...」%K%P

0x17D8
Okuhiko「Then you should have just said so from the beginning...」%K%P

0x17F4
Kurumi「Huh? Did something happen?」%K%P

0x1800
Makoto「No, it's nothing. Just talking amongst ourselves...」%K%P

0x180C
Makoto then tries to take the pizza.%K

0x6100
I've gotta stop him!

0x610C
Pretend not to see anything.

0x1854
I walk briskly over to Makoto...%K%P

0x1870
Yuka「Hold on, Makoto! It's not nothing, is it!?」%K%P

0x187C
Makoto「...Huh???」%K%P

0x1890
Yuka「Isn't the pizza a mistake?」%K%P

0x189C
I shoot a criticizing glare at Makoto, but he calmly%Nignores it.%K%P

0x18B0
Kurumi「Huh!? A mistake!?」%K%P

0x18C4
Kurumi「But the receipt definitely says you ordered a "Seafood%NPizza", didn't you?」%K%P

0x18D8
Yuka「I'm telling you, that's not what I meant. I'm saying we didn't%Norder anything.」%K%P

0x18E4
Kurumi「But...」%K%P

0x18F0
She checks the receipt again...%K%P

0x18FC
Kurumi「...This is definitely the right address.」%K%P

0x1908
Yuka「Well then, what's the name on the receiver's address?」%K%P

0x1914
Kurumi「A - S - A - K - U - R - A... It says Asakura here.」%K%P

0x1928
Yuka「See? Unfortunately, there isn't anyone here named—」%K%P

0x1944
Haruka「Wait...」%K%P

0x1950
Haruka「Wait a... minute.」%K%P

0x195C
Suddenly, Haruka cuts in.%K%P

0x1970
Haruka「I-I...」%K%P

0x197C
Haruka「I'm... Asakura.」%K%P

0x1988
Yuka「!?」%K%P

0x1994
Okuhiko「!?」%K%P

0x19A0
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x19B4
Kurumi「Whew... that's a relief♪」%K%P

0x19C0
Kurumi「That was a little alarming when you said it was a 'mistake'.」%K%P

0x19D4
I decide to just pretend not to see anything.%K%P

0x19E8
Kurumi「Okay! Here you go...」%K%P

0x1ABC
My efforts were in vain, as we ended up getting the%Npizza.%K%N

0x1AD0
In the end, we got the pizza.%K%N

0x1ADC
Was it fate from the beginning that we ended up stealing%NSaki's pizza...?%K%N

0x1AE8
Even I'm starting to think that way.%K%N

0x1AF4
Well, anyway, the four of us are silently eating the pizza.%K%N

0x1B00
Although I was against this... I'm too hungry to resist the%Ntemptation...%K%P

0x1B24
Makoto gives me a stunned, cold glare...%K%N

0x1B30
My stomach couldn't fight the hunger...%K%N

0x1B3C
If I continue to think that way, then I can endure these%Nfeelings of guilt.%K%N

0x1B48
And so...%K%N%N

0x1B54
(I'm sorry, Saki...)%K%N%N

0x1B60
...In my head, I continue to apologize to Saki.%K%P

0x1BE4
Announcer「Today is Monday, April 1st. This is the afternoon news.」%K%P

0x1BF0
We hear a polite voice from the announcer on the TV,%Nwhich is still on.%K%P

0x1BFC
At the same time, the mechanical bird starts chirping...%K%P

0x1C1C
"If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid."%K%P

0x1C6C
Just then, a feeling of misery spreads in my heart...%K%P

0x1C78
I don't want anyone, particularly Makoto, to notice I'm%Nfeeling this way, so I turn my gaze to outside the window.%K%P

0x1C84
...%K%P

0x1C98
Okuhiko「Hey, isn't it about time we got going?」%K%P

0x1CA4
(...?)%K%P

0x1CC0
Yuka「Go... where?」%K%P

0x1CD4
Okuhiko「Huh? What are you saying, Yuka-chan? We talked about%Nit last night, right...?」%K%P

0x1CE0
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x1CF4
Okuhiko「To play tennis. T-E-N-N-I-S!」%K%P

0x1D08
Yuka「A-Ah... that?」%K%P

0x1D14
I completely forgot about it...%K%P

0x1D20
Yuka「Right, right... Then shall we go play tennis...?」%K%P

0x1D2C
Makoto「But... Haruka, you don't want to play, do you?」%K%P

0x1D40
(—!?)%K%P

0x1D4C
I glare at Makoto.%K%P

0x1D68
Haruka「Huh? ...Y-Yes, that's right.」%K%P

0x1D7C
Haruka「Instead of tennis... I want to see the ocean.」%K%P

0x1D98
Okuhiko「The ocean!? ...I see, the ocean, huh...」%K%P

0x1DA4
After thinking for a little while, he suggests this...%K%P

0x1DB8
Okuhiko「Then I'll go to the ocean too.」%K%P

0x1DC4
Okuhiko「We're finally by the ocean, so it's only natural that we%Nought to see it first!」%K%P

0x1DD8
Yuka「Hmmmmmmm...」%K%P

0x1DE4
Yuka「...Yeah! I've got it!」%K%P

0x1DF0
I slam my fist into my palm.%K%P

0x1E04
Yuka「Then why don't we split into an Ocean Team and a Tennis%NTeam?」%K%P

0x1E10
Yuka「Haruka and Okuhiko-kun will go to the ocean while Makoto%Nand I go play tennis... How's that?」%K%P

0x1E1C
Okuhiko「Yeah, I don't mind at all.」%K%P

0x1E38
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1E44
Haruka says nothing.%K%P

0x1E50
Makoto seems to have figured out my plan, as he%Ndoesn't raise an objection.%K%P

0x1E5C
My plan is to do this so the two of us can talk all alone.%K%P

0x1E68
Yuka「All right then, shall we get going?」%K%P

0x1E7C
And so, we leave the lodge...%K%P

0x1F04
Makoto「Well then... now we can talk all we want, right?」%K%P

0x1F10
Makoto and I are sitting down on the bench at the tennis%Ncourt.%K%P

0x1F1C
Makoto「Is it all right if I ask you something?」%K%P

0x1F28
Makoto「Why can't we tell the others? You must have some sort%Nof reason that means we need to keep it a secret...」%K%P

0x1F34
He speaks to me with a solemn expression.%K%P

0x1F48
Yuka「Yes... But before that, I think it'd be best if we first%Nstraightened several things out.」%K%P

0x1F54
Yuka「I have a feeling that there are lots and lots of things%Nthat we still misunderstand or don't comprehend at all,%Nlike...」%K%P

0x1F60
Yuka「'Just what did we experience, and what are we%Nthinking?'...」%K%P

0x1F6C
Yuka「If we don't reach a mutual understanding first, our%Nconversations will clash, and then we'll have no idea%Nwhat the other's saying, right?」%K%P

0x1F78
Makoto gives me a deep nod, as if to say "I see".%K%P

0x1F84
Yuka「All right then. First off, let's confirm what we do know,%Nokay?」%K%P

0x1F90
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x1F9C
Yuka「I think there's three things that we can definitely say for%Nsure.」%K%P

0x2004
Yuka「#1—You and I share the same memories from April 1st%Nto the 6th...」%K%P

0x2044
Yuka「#2—Today's date is definitely Monday, April 1st...」%K%P

0x207C
Yuka「#3—On the last April 1st, we had the same dream...」%K%P

0x20C4
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Don't make this more complicated than it%Nactually is.」%K%P

0x20D0
Makoto「In short, this is what you want to say, right?」%K%P

0x20DC
Makoto「On Saturday, April 6th, we time traveled at that shrine...」%K%P

0x20E8
Makoto「...to Monday, April 1st... In other words, to today...」%K%P

0x20F4
Yuka「Mmm... time travel, huh...」%K%P

0x2100
Makoto「...You don't think it's something else, do you?」%K%P

0x2140
Yuka「No, there's no way that it's something else...」%K%P

0x214C
Yuka「It's just, do you really think that this is a simple problem%Nthat can be explained by those two words...?」%K%P

0x2158
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x2164
Yuka「The three facts we know right now... If all we knew were #1%Nand #2, then it'd probably be all right just to say that it%Nwas time travel', but..."」%K%P

0x2170
Yuka「The most important one is #3...」%K%P

0x217C
Makoto「That we had the same dream on the last April 1st?」%K%P

0x2188
Yuka「Yes... And if I had to say my thoughts on why, then my%Nanswer would be...」%K%P

0x219C
Yuka「To us, this wasn't the first time we've experienced time%Ntravel... That's the truth of the matter, right?」%K%P

0x21A8
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x21B4
Yuka「In other words, we've time traveled before, haven't we?」%K%P

0x21C0
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x21CC
Yuka「Which means that this should be the third time we've%Nexperienced today, the day known as Monday, April 1st',%Ncorrect?」%K%P

0x21D8
Makoto「'The last April 1st' and 'today'...」%K%P

0x21E4
Makoto「And the 'forgotten April 1st' that happened before our%Ndream...」%K%P

0x2200
Yuka「Yeah... That's what I thought, but...」%K%P

0x220C
Yuka「...Makoto, what day do you think it was before that%N'forgotten April 1st'?」%K%P

0x2218
Makoto「That'd be March 31st, obviously...」%K%P

0x2224
Yuka「You think so?」%K%P

0x2230
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x223C
Yuka「You really think so?」%K%P

0x2248
Makoto「What do you want to say?」%K%P

0x2294
Yuka「I think that the day before the 'forgotten April 1st' was%Nactually the '6th'.」%K%P

0x22A0
Makoto「Huh???」%K%P

0x22AC
Yuka「Truthfully, we have no clue how many times we've been%Nthrough today, 'April 1st'.」%K%P

0x2308
Yuka「Even though this is at least the third time, this might%Nactually be the 300th time, or the 300 millionth time...」%K%P

0x2314
Yuka「So trying to count the number of times itself might be%Npointless...」%K%P

0x2320
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x232C
Yuka「Perhaps... we've been repeating the days from April 1st%Nthrough the 6th countless times for all eternity?」%K%P

0x2338
Yuka「If there's no beginning, then there's no end—this is%Ndefinitely a part of an infinite loop!」%K%P

0x2344
All the trees sway in the wind.%K%P

0x2350
*Rustle, rustle...*%K%P

0x235C
That dry sound reaches my ears.%K%P

0x2368
Makoto's eyes slowly go blank as he stares out into%Nspace.%K%P

0x23A0
—An infinite loop.%K%P

0x23AC
In other words... our time has been sealed off.%K%P

0x23B8
A limited, confined interval of time.%K%P

0x23C4
—An infinite loop.%K%P

0x23D0
Going around and around to the same places at the%Nsame times...%K%P

0x23DC
Something we'll never be able to escape from for all of%Neternity.%K%P

0x23E8
It's like we're ants being forced to walk on a Möbius%Nstrip...%K%P

0x23F4
We can't live by looking towards the future, but on the%Nother hand, we can't rot away and die.%K%P

0x2400
All we can simply do is continue to live on in this insane%Nworld...%K%P

0x240C
With each coming day being a day we've already%Nexperienced.%K%P

0x2418
And then... it will come again...%K%P

0x2464
...That unbearable pain and sadness.%K%P

0x248C
We will die at that time.%K%P

0x2498
This world... will kill us.%K%P

0x24A4
This cruel fate will keep repeating...%K%P

0x24B0
(Repeating, Repeating, Repeating...)%K%P

0x24BC
Those words keep repeating in my head like an%Nincantation.%K%P

0x24D0
My path is concealed by darkness.%K%P

0x24DC
This is a hopeless world without even a single ray of%Nlight.%K%P

0x24E8
A pain that feels like pus is oozing in my head hits me.%K%P

0x24F4
If I keep thinking about this, I'll lose my sanity.%K%P

0x2500
It's all insane.%K%P

0x250C
That world...%K That future...%K That way of life...%K%P

0x2518
Repeating the same events... countless times... It's no%Ndifferent than being dead...%K%P

0x2524
Repeating the same events...%K%P

0x2530
Repeating... the same...%K%P

0x2560
—Huh?%K%P

0x256C
Spread out before my eyes is the empty tennis court...%K%P

0x2578
There's no one playing tennis there.%K%P

0x2584
That's no surprise.%K%P

0x2590
However... at this day, at this time, this is when Makoto%Nand I were having out little match, with no one else at the%Ncourt.%K%P

0x259C
And right now, we're not playing tennis.%K%P

0x25A8
It's different...%K It's different...%K%P

0x25B4
This history is different from the last one.%K%P

0x25C0
We didn't repeat the same event!%K ...We didn't repeat it!!!%K%P

0x25CC
And I could tell that this history was different!%K%P

0x25D8
(That's it... THAT'S IT!!)%K%P

0x2600
But at that time, Makoto firmly grabs my arm.%K%P

0x260C
And like that, he keeps pulling my arm as he begins to%Nwalk...%K%P

0x2618
Yuka「H-Hold on... Where are we going?」%K%P

0x2624
Makoto「We're running away...」%K%P

0x2630
Yuka「R-Running away...? Where to?」%K%P

0x263C
Makoto「That's obvious, isn't it...?」%K%P

0x2648
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x2654
Makoto「To the free world...」%K%P

0x26AC
Yuka「Huh? ...The harbor?」%K%P

0x26B8
Yuka「Wait, do you mean...?」%K%P

0x26C4
Makoto「That's right. We're going home.」%K%P

0x26D0
Yuka「H-How?」%K%P

0x26DC
Makoto「We'll take the ferry... Isn't that obvious?」%K%P

0x26F0
Yuka「But Makoto-」%K%P

0x26FC
Makoto「I'll buy us tickets, so wait there for a bit!」%K%P

0x2708
Makoto runs over to the ferry boarding area, not%Nlistening to me...%K%P

0x2770
...After that, Makoto's goes through one utter defeat%Nafter the next.%K%N

0x277C
Just what is he trying to do?%K%N

0x2788
I know that he's trying to get off the island as quickly as%Npossible.%K%N

0x2794
It's true that if we could get off this island, the tragedy%Nof the 6th might not repeat itself.%K%N

0x27A0
"By using the ferry or a fishing boat, we can escape%Nthis island."%K%N

0x27AC
That's what Makoto thinks.%K%P

0x27C0
However, today, the ferry is...%K%N%N

0x27CC
"Today, ferry service has been suspended due to bad%Nweather."%K%N%N

0x27D8
Makoto then talks to a nearby fisherman, asking him to%Nlend him his boat, but...%K%P

0x27EC
"D-Dumbass!!"%K%N%N

0x27F8
"Don't... don't underestimate the ocean!"%K%N%N

0x2804
"Yah know nothin' about the ocean, so don't get so%Nconceited..."%K%N%N

0x2810
...The shouting fisherman's voice reaches my ears.%K%P

0x2890
Yuka「No good, huh?」%K%P

0x289C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x28A8
He hangs his head down in misery.%K%P

0x28B4
Yuka「I saw what happened...」%K%P

0x28C0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x28D4
Yuka「Even though I tried to tell you to stop...」%K%P

0x28E0
Makoto「You knew?」%K%P

0x28EC
Yuka「Izumi-san said it earlier didn't she? 'Because a storm's%Ncoming from the sea, the fishing boats can't go out'...」%K%P

0x28F8
Yuka「'Because the migration velocity of the tropical cyclone%Nis slow, it'll be like this for about a week'... She also said%Nsomething like that.」%K%P

0x2904
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2918
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x2924
When I call his name, Makoto lifts his face.%K%P

0x2954
Yuka「Don't get so down!」%K%P

0x2960
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x296C
Yuka「Earlier, I said that this might be an infinite loop, didn't I?」%K%P

0x2978
Yuka「One that would repeat countless times for all eternity...」%K%P

0x2984
Yuka「But you know what? I think that it's probable that we took%Nthe exact same actions last time and the time before%Nthat.」%K%P

0x2990
Yuka「In other words, the same events always played itself%Nout...」%K%P

0x299C
Yuka「Why did things happen that way... Makoto, do you know?」%K%P

0x29A8
Makoto shakes his head.%K%P

0x29B4
Yuka「Because our memories were vague!」%K%P

0x29C0
Yuka「At times, just before something happened, we would%Nexperience a 'premonition'...」%K%P

0x29CC
Yuka「But in the end, they were useless...」%K%P

0x29D8
Yuka「But this time is different.」%K%P

0x29E4
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x29F0
Yuka「We have reliable memories this time... right?」%K%P

0x29FC
"I remember everything that happened in the last loop."%K%P

0x2A08
This fact is what I realized earlier at the tennis court.%K%P

0x2A14
Yuka「If that's the case, then even if we can't run away from%Nthe island, changing history will be easy!」%K%P

0x2A20
Makoto「Are you... for real?」%K%P

0x2A34
Yuka「Of course!」%K%P

0x2A40
Yuka「Actually, this morning, you subtly changed history, didn't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x2A4C
Yuka「For example, because I didn't cook, you were still%Nhungry.」%K%P

0x2A58
Yuka「Because you were hungry, you planned on stealing the%Npizza.」%K%P

0x2A74
Yuka「Then Okuhiko-kun's actions changed... and finally, it was%NHaruka who lied that her name was 'Asakura'...」%K%P

0x2A80
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2A94
Yuka「Makoto, do you know what the butterfly effect is?」%K%P

0x2AA0
Makoto「...No.」%K%P

0x2AAC
Yuka「'Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a%Ntornado in Texas?' —that's the butterfly effect.」%K%P

0x2AB8
Yuka「In short, it means 'A tiny little microscopic change could%Naffect even an enormous phenomenon'.」%K%P

0x2AC4
Yuka「It's not like history is immune to the accumulation of small,%Nmicroscopic events, right?」%K%P

0x2AD0
Yuka「So even if we just increase the number of small, trifling%Nchanges, it should be possible for reality to take a 180.」%K%P

0x2ADC
Makoto「...I see...」%K%P

0x2AF0
Yuka「History will definitely change!」%K%P

0x2AFC
Yuka「No. We WILL change history!」%K%P

0x2B08
Makoto「...This is our last chance...」%K%P

0x2B1C
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x2B28
Makoto「If, by any chance, the same events occur on this April%N6th...」%K%P

0x2B34
Makoto「Then we might never be able to get another chance to%Nbreak out of this loop again.」%K%P

0x2B40
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x2B4C
Makoto「Isn't that right?」%K%P

0x2B58
Makoto「When we wake up on the next morning of the 1st, there's%Nno guarantee that we'll have our memories, right!?」%K%P

0x2B64
Yuka「...Yeah... That certainly... might happen...」%K%P

0x2B70
Makoto「We'll change history—of course I agree with you%Nthere!」%K%P

0x2B7C
Makoto「But... either way, if we act selfishly, then it'll all go to%Nnothing. Understand?」%K%P

0x2B90
Yuka「Yeah...」%K%P

0x2B9C
Makoto「Even though we can repeat things, this is our last%Nchance!」%K%P

0x2BA8
Makoto「So don't pull a stunt like you did last time...」%K%P

0x2BB4
Makoto「Swear it right here, right now... No matter what happens,%Nnever go near that shrine again...」%K%P

0x2BC0
Yuka「...Got it... I swear it...」%K%P

0x2BCC
Makoto「'Promises must definitely be kept' —that's what you%Nwrote in your letter.」%K%P

0x2BD8
Makoto「Don't forget this vow... okay?」%K%P

0x2BFC
"Promises must definitely be kept."%K%P

0x2C08
Those words are burned into my mind, repeating over%Nand over again.%K%P

0x2C14
With a serious gaze, I give a slow, deep nod.%K%P

0x2C20
And then, I open my tightly shut mouth...%K%P

0x2C34
Yuka「Let's see it together.」%K%P

0x2C40
Yuka「Let's see the sunrise of April 7th... together.」%K%P

0x2C4C
...And mutter this.%K%P

0x2CB8
The waves breaking onto the pier are still calm right now.%K%P

0x2CC4
Makoto and I are sitting on the staircase right above it.%K%P

0x2CD0
As my hair sways in the gentle breeze... I put my%Nthoughts together.%K%P

0x2CDC
The reason why we returned to the past at that moment...%K%P

0x2CE8
There's only one thing... that I can think of.%K%P

0x2CF4
"The spring rain/ At the end of the cape/ Together with/%NThe echoing bell/ Will free you from time."%K%P

0x2D00
If that's the case, then what we should be doing is—%K%P

0x2D0C
Makoto「Say, Yuka? There's something I want you to tell me...」%K%P

0x2D20
Yuka「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x2D2C
Makoto「Yuka... you said this behind the shrine, right? 'I wanted to%Ngo back to the past, no matter what'...」%K%P

0x2D40
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2D4C
Makoto「Would you tell me the reason why you wanted to return%Nto the past?」%K%P

0x2D58
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2D64
Makoto「Hey, you're still planning on keeping it a secret this late%Nin the game?」%K%P

0x2D70
Yuka「It's not... like that...」%K%P

0x2D7C
Makoto「Then why...?」%K%P

0x2D88
Yuka「...I understand. I'll tell you...」%K%P

0x2D94
Yuka「But before that-」%K%P

0x2DA0
Makoto「Yuka! You've been saying 'but before that' way too many%Ntimes!」%K%P

0x2DAC
Makoto「You're always postponing questions.」%K%P

0x2DB8
Makoto「Earlier, at the tennis court, I asked you... Why can't we tell%Nthe others the truth?'」%K%P

0x2DC4
Makoto「...You still haven't answered that one.」%K%P

0x2DD8
Yuka「That's your fault, Makoto.」%K%P

0x2DE4
Yuka「You interrupted the conversation and suddenly brought%Nus here...」%K%P

0x2DF0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2DFC
Yuka「The reason we can't tell the others the truth... is simple.」%K%P

0x2E08
Yuka「It's dangerous.」%K%P

0x2E14
Makoto「Dangerous?」%K%P

0x2E20
Yuka「Think about it carefully, will you?」%K%P

0x2E2C
Yuka「How are we gonna expect them to believe us...」%K%P

0x2E38
Yuka「...about this strange reality, if we tell them?」%K%P

0x2E44
Yuka「To win their trust, we'd have to tell them everything,%Nwouldn't you say?」%K%P

0x2E50
Makoto「Yeah... That's true...」%K%P

0x2EB8
Yuka「Anything and everything... The time, the place, the%Ncircumstances, we'd have to tell them all of that, wouldn't%Nwe?」%K%P

0x2EC4
Makoto「Yeah, I get that much...」%K%P

0x2EE8
Yuka「Then let me ask you this... If you were in the others'%Nposition, what would you do?」%K%P

0x2EF4
Yuka「What would you do if someone told you strange%Nstories...」%K%P

0x2F00
Yuka「...about time travel and infinite loops...?」%K%P

0x2F0C
Makoto「Well... I probably wouldn't believe it, at first...」%K%P

0x2F18
Yuka「Right? You'd think they were crazy.」%K%P

0x2F24
Yuka「But as the story continues, you're presented with all%Nsorts of proof...」%K%P

0x2F94
Yuka「For example, let's say I made a prediction about%Nsomething in the future, something that everyone else%Nwould definitely not know about, and it came true...」%K%P

0x2FA0
Yuka「If that happened, then you'd have to believe me, right?」%K%P

0x2FAC
Makoto「Hmm... I wonder about that...」%K%P

0x2FD0
Yuka「Well, it would be all right even if you didn't.」%K%P

0x3010
Yuka「Anyway, for now, let's try assuming that you do believe%Nme.」%K%P

0x301C
Yuka「'There's no room to doubt her story'...You think something%Nalong those lines... So then, what would you think next?」%K%P

0x3028
Makoto「... 'Shouldn't I go to confirm whether or not that story's%Ntrue?'」%K%P

0x3034
Yuka「See? That's what I thought!」%K%P

0x3040
Yuka「No matter how much we insisted, it's likely that the others%Nwouldn't believe us...」%K%P

0x304C
Yuka「Even if they did believe us, wouldn't that just put them%Ninto danger?」%K%P

0x3058
Yuka「People's curiosity is something a lot stronger than what%Nmost think.」%K%P

0x3064
Yuka「Even if they knew it were dangerous, the others might go%Nto the shrine at the time specified to confirm its validity.」%K%P

0x3080
Makoto「...I see... so that's it...」%K%P

0x308C
Yuka「After all, this is our problem in the first place... I don't...%Nwant to involve others...」%K%P

0x30A0
Makoto goes silent...%K But before long...%K%P

0x30C8
Makoto「...All right!」%K%P

0x30D4
...With an enthusiastic shout, he stands up on the pier.%K%P

0x30E0
Makoto「Well then, shall we begin!?」%K%P

0x30F4
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x3100
I tilt my head in confusion.%K%P

0x310C
Makoto「Let's go, Yuka!」%K%P

0x3118
He starts to walk away.%K%P

0x3134
Yuka「Geez... don't walk off without saying anything.」%K%P

0x3140
Yuka「Where do you plan to go this time?」%K%P

0x314C
Makoto「We'll make it...」%K%P

0x3158
Yuka「Make...? Make what?」%K%P

0x3164
Makoto「That's obvious, isn't it...?」%K%P

0x3178
Yuka「Hmm???」%K%P

0x3184
Makoto「A free world...」%K%P

0x3190
At that moment, the sea breeze grazes the tip of my%Nnose, containing both a salty aroma and the gentle smell%Nof spring.%K%P

0x31A4
Yuka「Haah, that again...?」%K%P

0x31B8
Although I say this, I smile and rush over to Makoto.%K%P

0x31C4
My mind is still full of anxiety.%K However...%K%P

0x31D0
"If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid."%K%P

0x31DC
I mustn't be afraid...%K%P

0x3234
Yuka「So what's the plan?」%K%P

0x3240
I ask this while walking.%K%P

0x324C
Makoto「Plan?」%K%P

0x3258
Yuka「Your plan to make a free world!」%K%P

0x3264
Makoto「Yeah... First, I think I'll try doing whatever I can ...」%K%P

0x3270
Yuka「Do you have any specific ideas?」%K%P

0x327C
Makoto「I'm going to destroy the bells!」%K%P

0x3290
(—!?)%K%P

0x329C
Yuka「H-Hold on!」%K%P

0x32A8
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x32B4
Yuka「Are you serious about that...?」%K%P

0x32C0
Makoto「Isn't that obvious? If those bells weren't there, none of%Nthis would have happened.」%K%P

0x32CC
Makoto「That's already been proven, hasn't it?」%K%P

0x32D8
Makoto「'The echoing bell/ Will free you from time' —It was%Nwritten on that talisman...」%K%P

0x32EC
Yuka「See, we're clashing.」%K%P

0x32F8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x3304
Yuka「Our thoughts are differing!」%K%P

0x3310
Yuka「Even though I said at the beginning that we should try%Nstraightening things out...」%K%P

0x331C
Makoto「Then you're against destroying the bells?」%K%P

0x3330
Yuka「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x333C
Makoto「Why...?」%K%P

0x3348
Makoto「If we didn't have those bells, we... Ah!」%K%P

0x3354
Makoto「That's right! There's something I still haven't asked you%Nyet!」%K%P

0x3360
Yuka「The reason I didn't... throw away the bell?」%K%P

0x336C
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x3378
Yuka「That's...」%K%P

0x3384
Yuka「That's because...」%K%P

0x3408
Yuka「Because I remembered...」%K%P

0x3414
Makoto「...Huh?」%K%P

0x3420
Yuka「The palm from my dream...」%K%P

0x342C
Yuka「I remembered... that it was yours...」%K%P

0x3438
Yuka「That's why, on the morning of the last 1st... I headed%Nstraight for... your room.」%K%P

0x3444
"A dream where someone died."%K%P

0x3450
"—Was that someone... Makoto...?"%K%P

0x345C
Yuka「When I saw that you knew nothing, Makoto...」%K%P

0x3468
Yuka「I felt relieved, and for a little while after that, I thought%Nthat 'it was just a dream'...」%K%P

0x3474
Yuka「But the second time I saw that bell... the bell that the girl%Nhad on Viewpoint Park...」%K%P

0x3480
Yuka「I couldn't help but grow uneasy...」%K%P

0x348C
Yuka「What if you got the bell and something bad happened? I%Nwas worried...」%K%P

0x3498
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x34A4
Yuka「So I found that girl, and traded the bell for my key%Nchain...」%K%P

0x34B0
Yuka「At first, I thought I'd try throwing it into the ocean...」%K%P

0x34BC
Yuka「So I went to the tip of Viewpoint Park to throw it...」%K%P

0x34C8
Yuka「But... I reconsidered it.」%K%P

0x34D4
Yuka「After all, perhaps the waves might have carried it away%Nand caused it to wash up on some beach.」%K%P

0x34E0
Yuka「And obviously, I couldn't check to see if it really sunk to%Nthe bottom of the ocean or not...」%K%P

0x34EC
Yuka「I would just feel scared the whole time, with no way to get%Nrid of that fear...」%K%P

0x34F8
Yuka「So I thought that if I carried it... if I always carried it, it'd%Nbe all right...」%K%P

0x3550
Yuka「This time, it's your turn, Makoto.」%K%P

0x355C
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x3568
Yuka「Tell me why you had that bell...」%K%P

0x3574
Makoto「Oh... that?」%K%P

0x3580
Makoto「It was a present from Kurumi...」%K%P

0x3594
"This is something Kurumi found on Moon Beach this%Nafternoon."%K%P

0x35A0
"It's very pretty, so she'll give it to you♪"%K%P

0x35AC
Makoto had gotten a letter from Kurumi-chan.%K He tells me%Nthe contents of the letter, and that enclosed with the%Nletter was his bell.%K%P

0x35F0
Makoto「Well, in short, it seems there were two bells from the%Nbeginning.」%K%P

0x35FC
Makoto「The bell I found on the 1st and the bell you found on the%N3rd were different bells.」%K%P

0x3610
Makoto「I threw my bell away on the 1st, which washed up two%Ndays later, and that girl picked it up on the evening of%Nthe 3rd on Moon Beach.」%K%P

0x3624
Makoto「You threw your bell away on the 3rd, it washed up two%Ndays later, and on the afternoon of the 5th, Kurumi%Npicked it up.」%K%P

0x3648
Makoto「So in the end, the bell I had was the one you threw away,%NYuka...」%K%P

0x3654
Makoto「And the bell you had is the one I threw away... That's%Nwhat happened.」%K%P

0x3694
Yuka「Hmm... I see...」%K%P

0x36A0
Makoto「She probably didn't have any ill will in giving it to me... But%Nthanks to that, things turned out this way...」%K%P

0x36AC
Yuka「Then you're not going to thank her?」%K%P

0x36B8
Makoto「Huh!? Why would I thank...」%K%P

0x36CC
Yuka「Haah... You really don't get it...」%K%P

0x36D8
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x36EC
Yuka「If Kurumi-chan hadn't given you that bell, you'd be dead.」%K%P

0x36F8
Makoto's expression instantly freezes over.%K%P

0x370C
Yuka「'The echoing bell/ Will free you from time'...so if you didn't%Nhave that bell...」%K%P

0x3718
Makoto「I couldn't... have time traveled...」%K%P

0x3724
Yuka「Yes.」%K%P

0x3730
Yuka「We were able to be saved because our%Nconsciousnesses were flung to this time...」%K%P

0x373C
Yuka「Well, 'saved' might not be the best way to put it, but...」%K%P

0x3748
Yuka「Anyway, if our consciousnesses had stayed at the%Nshrine on the 6th, then all that would have remained of%Nour existences would be our dead, physical bodies.」%K%P

0x3754
Yuka「In other words, in this flow of time, we're actually still%Nalive, but...」%K%P

0x3760
Yuka「In the flow of time connected to that April 6th, we're%Ndead... That's how it is.」%K%P

0x376C
Yuka「It's a bit hard to grasp, so I take it you're confused.」%K%P

0x3778
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x3784
Yuka「Then try thinking about it like this.」%K%P

0x3798
Yuka「Let's say there's this long, wide road that's a straight%Nline.」%K%P

0x37A4
Yuka「On that road, there's seven cars moving. They're neatly%Nlined up side-by-side... Each car has one driver...」%K%P

0x37B0
Yuka「Haruka, Saki, Kurumi-chan, Izumi-san, Okuhiko-kun, me, and%Nyou are the drivers.」%K%P

0x37BC
Yuka「And far behind those seven cars are another group of%Nseven cars, also lined up side-by-side.」%K%P

0x37C8
Yuka「Driving those cars are a different Haruka, a different%NSaki, a different Kurumi-chan... A different version of%Neveryone are driving the cars ahead.」%K%P

0x37D4
Yuka「You get me so far?」%K%P

0x37E0
Makoto「...Y-Yeah.」%K%P

0x37F4
Yuka「Well then, at a certain time... suddenly, you and I have a%Nheart attack or something and die.」%K%P

0x3800
Yuka「Our bodies die, but our consciousness don't. Instead,%Nthey slip into the bodies of our alternate selves driving%Nthe cars behind the first group.」%K%P

0x380C
Yuka「We just continue to travel down the same road we were%Ndriving on up until now...」%K%P

0x3818
Yuka「So what about the cars traveling in front?」%K%P

0x3824
Yuka「Our corpses are still inside, continuing to travel down%Nforever...」%K%P

0x3864
Yuka「And that's how it is... Does it make sense to you now?」%K%P

0x3870
Makoto「Well... more or less.」%K%P

0x387C
Makoto「In short, if I didn't get that bell from Kurumi...」%K%P

0x3888
Makoto「I would have been squashed under that collapsed%Nshrine, and my consciousness would have completely%Ncome to a stop...」%K%P

0x3894
Makoto「...I wouldn't be able to slip out of that car, and my%Nconsciousness would have died with my body... Isn't that%Nright...?」%K%P

0x38A0
I slowly nod.%K%P

0x38AC
Yuka「And that's how it's connected to our earlier%Nconversation.」%K%P

0x38B8
Yuka「That's why it's best not to destroy the bells.」%K%P

0x38C4
Makoto「Huh???」%K%P

0x38D0
Yuka「You don't get it?」%K%P

0x38DC
Yuka「To us, those bells are our last fortress... They're literally%Nour 'lifelines'.」%K%P

0x38E8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x38F4
Yuka「'If, by any chance, the same events occur on this April%N6th'...」%K%P

0x3900
Yuka「...You said that at the harbor...」%K%P

0x3914
Yuka「If we don't have the bell at that 'by any chance' time...」%K%P

0x3920
Yuka「We won't just lose a free world, we'll lose the world itself.」%K%P

0x392C
Makoto「It'll mean the complete annihilation of our%Nconsciousnesses...」%K%P

0x3938
Yuka「By changing history from now on, I think it'll get difficult to%Npredict what will happen on that day.」%K%P

0x3944
Makoto「So basically... it's our guarantee?」%K%P

0x3950
Makoto「It's best to have a lifeline to hold on to just to be safe?」%K%P

0x3964
Yuka「Yes...」%K%P

0x3970
Yuka「Wouldn't it be better if our first priority was finding the%Nbells instead of destroying them?」%K%P

0x397C
Yuka「That's... what I think...」%K%P

0x3A20
Makoto「Heeeey, Yukaaaaa, did you find iiiiit?」%K%P

0x3A2C
I hear Makoto, who is a a bit away from me, shout.%K%P

0x3A38
Yuka「Not yet〜...」%K%P

0x3A44
I shout back, then briefly interrupt my search to look%Nwhere Makoto is.%K%P

0x3A50
He's turning over some seaweed that has washed up on%Nthe sandy beach.%K%P

0x3A64
Yuka「Hey, are you sure that it's around here?」%K%P

0x3A70
Makoto「I'm sure! I definitely picked it up around here! So keep%Nlooking.」%K%P

0x3A7C
Yuka「Hmm... but that's not very reliable.」%K%P

0x3A88
Yuka「It's been almost six days since you found it, after all...」%K%P

0x3A9C
A slightly bigger wave hits the beach.%K%P

0x3AA8
Just like all the others up until now, fragments of%Nseashells wash up, while the wave grabs the%Nreddish-green seaweed and pulls it back into the%Nocean...%K%P

0x3AB4
Yuka「Besides, didn't you find it at night? If that's the case, it%Nmeans the scenery is very different than...」%K%P

0x3ACC
When I get to that point, something shines in the wet%Nsand.%K%P

0x3AD8
It's a piercing, sharp cold light...%K%P

0x3B04
(...Huh?)%K%P

0x3B10
As if it's luring me over, I stagger over to that point.%K%P

0x3B1C
I lean over, and pick up the source of the light...%K%P

0x3B30
(...)%K%P

0x3B3C
(...Found it...)%K%P

0x3B48
(...I found it!)%K%P

0x3B54
Yuka「I found it!」%K%P

0x3B68
Makoto「'I... found it'? Did you find the bell?」%K%P

0x3B7C
Yuka「Yep! Look♪」%K%P

0x3B88
I pinch the bell with my fingers, and show it to Makoto.%K%P

0x3B94
Its metal surface emits a cold light.%K Tied to it is a light%Ncrimson string.%K This is definitely that bell.%K%P

0x3BC8
The bell sways in the wind, and rings out once.%K%P

0x3BF0
Yuka「See♪」%K%P

0x3BFC
Makoto「Th...」%K%P

0x3C08
Makoto「That's right! This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it!!」%K%P

0x3C14
With a very excited voice, Makoto takes the bell from my%Nhand.%K%P

0x3C20
Makoto「All right! One lifeline down!!」%K%P

0x3C2C
Makoto holds the bell up.%K Bathing in the sunlight, the bell%Nshines.%K%P

0x3C40
Yuka「Um... I don't mind that you're happy and all, but...」%K%P

0x3C4C
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x3C58
Yuka「Aren't you going to give me a 'thank you' or something?」%K%P

0x3C64
Makoto「Thank you, Yuka♪」%K%P

0x3C78
...Well, that was quick.%K%P

0x3C84
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3C90
That smile... it's very radiant.%K%P

0x3C9C
Makoto「Well then, take this bell...」%K%P

0x3CB0
Yuka「...Huh?」%K%P

0x3CBC
Makoto takes my hand... and then he gently drops the%Nbell in my palm.%K%P

0x3CD0
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x3CDC
Makoto「You found this bell. So this is yours.」%K%P

0x3CE8
Yuka「But-」%K%P

0x3CF4
Makoto「Besides...」%K%P

0x3D00
Makoto「Didn't I say it before? Men ought to protect%Nwomen—that's how it's been for ages.」%K%P

0x3D0C
Perhaps he's embarrassed to say this, as Makoto says%Nthis while rubbing the bottom of his nose with his fingertip.%K%P

0x3D20
Those are the words he said under that starry sky...%K%P

0x3D2C
There's no way I can just agree with him.%K%P

0x3D38
But...%K But...%K%P

0x3D44
...I meekly grasp the bell.%K%P

0x3D50
Makoto「All right! Let's find the second one!」%K%P

0x3D5C
With a cheerful shout, Makoto begins to search for the%Nnext bell.%K%P

0x3D68
Looking at his back, I quietly mutter something to myself...%K%P

0x3D74
Yuka「You really are nice...」%K%P

0x3D80
Yuka「You're exactly like him in that sense.」%K%P

0x3E44
...In the end, no matter how hard we search, we can't find%Nthe second bell.%K%N

0x3E50
It's probably still in the ocean, and won't wash up on the%Nbeach until the 3rd.%K%N

0x3E5C
I feel uneasy about it, but for now, there's no choice but%Nto suspend the search for the bell.%K%N

0x3E68
When the sky is dyed a beautiful crimson color, we meet%Nup with the Ocean Team.%K%P

0x3E74
We then proceed towards Lunabeach, as if we're luring%NOkuhiko-kun there.%K%P

0x3E88
We don't have a reason to avoid the place, and%Nbesides...%K%N

0x3E94
If we don't go there, then we'll be complete strangers to%NKurumi-chan and Izumi-san...%K%N

0x3EA0
When I think about it... I'm overcome with an overwhelming%Nfeeling of loneliness.%K%P

0x3EB4
In the last six days...%K%N

0x3EC0
We did a lot of fun things.%K%N

0x3ECC
I don't want to lose all those precious memories.%K%N

0x3ED8
We have a lot of problems, but even the most complex of%Nour problems has a source.%K%N

0x3EE4
And we know all those sources.%K%N

0x3EF0
In that case...%K%P

0x3F04
—I'll only change the bad events into good ones.%K%N

0x3F10
Makoto must be thinking the same thing...%K%N

0x3F1C
We enter Lunabeach, and as Kurumi-chan recognizes us%Nfrom the pizza incident, we quickly hit it off.%K%N%N

0x3F28
Before long, we begin to introduce ourselves...%K%P

0x3FC0
Suddenly, the door is violently thrust open.%K%P

0x3FCC
I don't even need to turn around to know who it is...%K%P

0x3FFC
Saki「My name is 'Asakura'. Is the manager here?」%K%P

0x4018
Yuka「Saki... Could it be that you're THAT Saki Asakura?」%K%P

0x402C
Once I notice her, I immediately call out to her.%K%P

0x4038
I need to pretend to be surprised by our chance%Nreunion as much as possible...%K%P

0x4044
Just as I'd hoped, Saki forgets about the pizza and%Nbecomes engrossed in conversation with me.%K%P

0x4058
Saki「Of course. But Yuka, what are you doing on this island?%NYou don't live here, do you?」%K%P

0x4064
Yuka「No way! I'm here for my college's 'Seminar Camp'. I'm%Nstaying at the lodge on top of the hill road surrounded%Nby the forest...」%K%P

0x4078
Saki「Huh? Well then, doesn't mean you're near my summer%Nhouse?」%K%P

0x408C
I plan to keep talking like this to wash away the topic of%Nthe pizza...%K But...%K%P

0x40A0
Izumi「By the way...」%K%P

0x40AC
Izumi「...What did you come here for?」%K%P

0x40C0
...Those casual words have ruined my plan.%K%P

0x40CC
I know that she didn't have a shred of ill will in saying it,%Nbut...%K%P

0x40E0
And thus, Saki begins harping on Izumi-san about the%Npizza...%K%P

0x40EC
And then...%K%P

0x40F8
Kurumi「It did too! Kurumi delivered it to an 'Asakura-san'!」%K%P

0x4104
Kurumi「Kurumi did deliver it to 'Asakura-san'!」%K%P

0x4120
...Kurumi-chan points at Haruka.%K%P

0x4134
...Kurumi-chan points to Makoto.%K%P

0x4174
Saki「Just what the hell does that mean!?」%K%P

0x41A0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x41AC
The image of their fight from the last 3rd passes by my%Nmind...%K%P

0x41C0
Just as Saki advances towards Haruka, someone gets%Nbetween the two of them.%K%P

0x41CC
Makoto「Hey, cut it out.」%K%P

0x41D8
...It's Makoto.%K%P

0x41EC
Saki「What was that!?」%K%P

0x4200
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x420C
Makoto's eyebrows furrow as he runs a hand by his%Nforehead.%K%P

0x4218
He seems to be thinking about how to deal with this.%K%P

0x4224
Before long...%K%P

0x4230
Makoto「I'm sorry...」%K%P

0x423C
...He says this with a serious look.%K%P

0x4248
Makoto「I'm the one who decided to take the pizza, so it's my%Nfault... I'm sorry.」%K%P

0x425C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x4268
Makoto「But you know... if you're this angry, you should have just%Ncalled earlier.」%K%P

0x4274
Saki「Wh-What the hell... You don't even know anything...」%K%P

0x4280
Saki「This is why I don't want to talk to you assholes!」%K%P

0x42A4
Saki「Anyway, just get the hell out of my way!」%K%P

0x42B0
Saki「The one I want to talk to is that girl, not you.」%K%P

0x42BC
Makoto「I won't move.」%K%P

0x42C8
Saki「Hmph, what's this... You trying to look cool in front of her?」%K%P

0x42DC
Makoto「...Can't you just forgive and forget?」%K%P

0x42E8
Saki「I'm not in the forgiving mood right now. Well, not unless%Nyou plan on compensating me.」%K%P

0x42F4
Makoto「Hmm, this is a dilemma...」%K%P

0x4308
Saki「Hey! Don't go making that contemplative look there!」%K%P

0x4314
Saki「All you've got is your mouth, so say whatever you like.」%K%P

0x4328
Saki「After all, that's what all men are like...」%K%P

0x4334
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4340
Saki「See, you don't even have a comeback for that.」%K%P

0x435C
Saki「So just get out of my way.」%K%P

0x4368
Makoto's mouth is completely shut.%K%P

0x4374
Unable to bear just standing by and watching anymore, I%Ntake a step forward, intending to back up Makoto.%K%P

0x4390
But, at that time...%K%P

0x439C
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x43A8
Makoto「...You're the same as she was back then...」%K%P

0x43BC
Saki「Huh...?」%K%P

0x43C8
Saki is dumbfounded by Makoto's completely%Nunexpected words.%K%P

0x43D4
The others also look completely lost, unsure of where%NMakoto's going with this.%K%P

0x43E0
Makoto「Unreasonable, talking down to others, always insisting to%Nhave things your own way...」%K%P

0x43EC
Makoto「There was a girl that I knew who was just like that.」%K%P

0x43F8
Saki「...」%K%P

0x4404
Makoto「You should loosen up more.」%K%P

0x4410
Makoto「That tiresome way of life doesn't suit you.」%K%P

0x441C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x4428
Makoto「Not you... nor that girl...」%K%P

0x4434
Saki firmly stares at Makoto's face.%K%P

0x4440
Could she be measuring the true meaning of his words?%K%P

0x444C
...This feels strange.%K This feels very strange.%K%P

0x4458
(...Have I seen this exchange before...?)%K%P

0x4464
...The shop's interior is devoid of conversation.%K Calming%Nmusic flows from the jukebox and reaches our ears.%K%P

0x4480
Izumi「Hey, everyone...?」%K%P

0x448C
...In the slightly tense atmosphere, Izumi-san speaks up.%K%P

0x4498
Everyone's gazes converge on Izumi-san.%K%P

0x44A4
Izumi「Why don't...」%K%P

0x44B8
Izumi「...you all eat with me tonight?」%K%P

0x44E0
(...Wh-What???)%K%P

0x44EC
It feels like the atmosphere has instantly stiffened.%K%P

0x44F8
With that out-of-place cheerful tone and that%N(incomprehensible) proposal, no one is sure just%Nexactly how to react.%K%P

0x4514
Kurumi「On-Onee-chan... What are you saying at a time like this?」%K%P

0x4520
Izumi「Well, Yuka-chan and Saki-chan have finally reunited, so%Nwe should celebrate♪」%K%P

0x452C
Izumi「I want them to consider it my apology for the pizza.」%K%P

0x4540
Kurumi「B-But...」%K%P

0x4554
Izumi「And besides, didn't they use to say this in the past?」%K%P

0x4560
Everyone「???」%K%P

0x4574
Izumi「'Anger is proof of an empty stomach'♪」%K%P

0x45C4
Thanks to Izumi-san's splendid(?) mediation, that stormy%Natmosphere has been vanquished.%K%P

0x45D0
In the end, we decide to agree to Izumi-san's plan to%Ntreat us to dinner.%K%P

0x45E4
Saki「By the way, Izumi-san... what do you have to eat here...?」%K%P

0x45F8
Izumi「Hmm, let's see...」%K%P

0x460C
Izumi「We have paella and Italian salad, as well as pumpkin%Nsoup!」%K%P

0x4620
I glare at Makoto.%K Of course, it's to tell him to keep his%Nmouth shut right now...%K%P

0x462C
However, it doesn't change the fact that they're out of%Nrice, so either way, they have to go shopping...%K%P

0x4638
Makoto「If that's the case, then what if I go buy some?」%K%P

0x4654
Just then...%K%P

0x4684
Saki「...I'm coming too.」%K%P

0x4690
...Saki says this, and quietly stands up.%K%P

0x469C
(What!?)%K%P

0x46A8
Everyone simultaneously turns their gazes towards Saki.%K%P

0x46B4
Makoto and I do the same... We stare at Saki,%Ndumbfounded.%K%P

0x46C8
A derisive smile appears on Saki's face...%K%P

0x46D4
Saki「What's wrong? Got a problem with me coming along?」%K%P

0x46E0
Makoto「No... Not really...」%K%P

0x46F4
Saki「Then it's fine, isn't it? Shall we go?」%K%P

0x4700
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x4714
Saki grabs Makoto's arm, and drags him towards the exit.%K%P

0x4720
Makoto faces her with a bewildered gaze.%K%P

0x472C
I tilt my head, also confused about what's going on.%K%P

0x4738
Just before Saki opens the shop doors, our eyes meet.%K%P

0x4744
The look in her eyes give me the impression that she's%Ndeep in thought...%K%P

0x4760
At that time, I feel something unpleasant rising in my%Nchest.%K%P

0x476C
...I don't really know what it is, just that it's something%Nunpleasant.%K%P

0x47D8
At least forty minutes have passed since those two left.%K%P

0x47E4
Izumi-san and Kurumi-chan are in the shop's kitchen,%Npreparing the food they've got on hand.%K%P

0x47F0
Haruka is sitting in one of the corner seats, and sitting%Nnext to her is Okuhiko-kun, who is enthusiastically trying%N(in vain) to talk to her.%K%P

0x47FC
I gaze out at the darkening scenery as I wait for those%Ntwo to come back.%K%P

0x4808
...They're late.%K This would be considered too late no%Nmatter what, wouldn't it...?%K%P

0x4814
Upon her suggestion, the two of them rode Izumi-san's%Nbicycle.%K%P

0x4820
Even though the round trip from here to the shopping%Ndistrict should be 15 minutes by bike...%K%P

0x482C
Those two didn't get caught up in some sort of trouble%Non the way, did they...?%K%P

0x4838
I recall Saki's expression just before they set out.%K I've%Nnever seen Saki with an expression like that before...%K%P

0x4844
The day gets darker and darker...%K%P

0x4850
Right now, the sky is like the final embers of a candle%Nthat are disappearing... as the sky changes from%Ncrimson... to violet.%K%P

0x48B4
...Not even ten minutes later, Makoto and Saki return.%K%P

0x48C0
Saki is being carried on Makoto's back.%K The two of them%Nare hurt...%K%P

0x48CC
I immediately take Izumi-san with me, and run over%Ntowards where they are.%K%P

0x48FC
Saki「I said it's fine! Just let me down already, dammit!!」%K%P

0x4908
Makoto「Shut up! Injured people don't get to talk!」%K%P

0x4914
Saki「You're injured too!!」%K%P

0x4920
We can hear their conversation as we get closer.%K%P

0x492C
When Makoto sees us, he finally puts down both Saki and%Nthe shopping bags.%K%P

0x4938
...Makoto was holding two bulging shopping bags and%Nwas also carrying Saki on his back.%K%P

0x4944
As a result, Makoto squats down due to exhaustion. He%Nthen begins explaining what happened.%K%P

0x4950
It seems the two of them fell off the bike on their way%Nback... and Makoto's got cuts all over his body to show it.%K%P

0x495C
At that time, Saki injured her foot, so Makoto carried her%Nback.%K%P

0x4968
Makoto「...M-My arms feel like lead...」%K%P

0x497C
Saki「H-How rude! I don't weigh that much!」%K%P

0x4988
Makoto「Y-You're wrong! It's not from you, Saki...」%K%P

0x4994
Those two seem to be getting along now...%K%P

0x49A0
Makoto「I'm sorry, Izumi-san... I had to leave the bike behind...」%K%P

0x49BC
Izumi「That's fine... I can get it later.」%K%P

0x49D0
Izumi「Ah, you look terrible. We need to disinfect those wounds...」%K%P

0x49DC
Makoto「Oh, I'm fine. Tend to Saki first.」%K%P

0x49F0
Saki「You can deal with me later.」%K%P

0x49FC
Makoto「Geez... just shut up and let them tend to you first.」%K%P

0x4A10
Izumi「Now, now...」%K%P

0x4A24
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x4A30
I look back and forth between Saki and the abandoned%Nshopping bags... I head over to Saki.%K%P

0x4A44
Yuka「Well then, why don't we go back inside, Saki? ...Can you%Nwalk?」%K%P

0x4A58
I lend Saki my shoulder, and head back into the shop.%K%P

0x4A64
Saki follows me while dragging one foot along.%K%P

0x4A9C
And, as soon as we enter the shop, she immediately%Nmoves away from me.%K%P

0x4AB0
Yuka「Saki...?」%K%P

0x4ABC
Saki「...That's good enough...」%K%P

0x4AD0
She says that, and moves over to the inner terrace.%K%P

0x4AE4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x4AF8
Izumi「Y-Yuka-chan... can you bring these over there?」%K%P

0x4B04
As Izumi-san enters the shop with Makoto, she points to%Nthe rice bin on the counter, and holds up the shopping%Nbags.%K%P

0x4B18
I nod, and take the shopping bags from her.%K%P

0x4B24
—Whoosh!%K%P

0x4B30
(W-Wow, this is heavy...)%K%P

0x4B3C
I grimace; it's a lot heavier than I thought it'd be.%K%P

0x4B48
(Makoto... He carried both of these AND Saki...?)%K%P

0x4B54
I totter under their weight, and glance at Makoto.%K%P

0x4B60
Izumi-san is in the middle of treating Makoto and Saki.%K%P

0x4B6C
Saki says something, and Makoto laughs.%K%P

0x4B88
(...Huh? H-Huh?)%K%P

0x4B94
(...My chest feels like it's in pain... )%K%P

0x4C48
It's a little later than last time, but Izumi-san's dinner is%Ndone.%K%N

0x4C54
Paella, pumpkin soup, and Italian salad.%K%N

0x4C60
There's an amazing variety of many delicious tastes%Nand dishes...%K%N

0x4C6C
I happily fill my stomach with that food in a daze, as if the%Ndepression I felt earlier was completely fake.%K%N

0x4C78
We all only shared one pizza for lunch, so our stomachs%Nare emptier than we thought...%K%P

0x4C84
By the time I've filled my stomach, the pain I felt in my%Nchest earlier has gone away.%K%P

0x4C98
After dinner, we head to the pool.%K%N

0x4CA4
According to what I heard, it seems that Izumi-san fell%Ninto the pool last time.%K%N

0x4CB0
But Makoto pretends not to know about it.%K%N

0x4CBC
—It's in order to create a good history.%K%N

0x4CC8
After all, this is also "A precious memory".%K%P

0x4CDC
...We return to Lunabeach, and promise to "Go to the pool%Ntomorrow".%K%N

0x4CE8
We part ways with Izumi-san and Kurumi-chan...%K%N%N

0x4CF4
And then...%K%P

0x4D88
...I'm currently lying down on my bed, exhausted.%K%P

0x4D94
Many things happened today.%K%P

0x4DA0
I vacantly stare at the ceiling while thinking over the%Nevents of "this April 1st".%K%P

0x4E08
The today known as April 1st...%K%N

0x4E14
We lost consciousness at the shrine, and when we came%Nto, we were in this lodge.%K%N

0x4E20
On top of that, we time traveled to the 1st...%K%N

0x4E2C
...And then I embraced Makoto...%K%N%N

0x4E38
(...I cried so loudly...)%K%N%N

0x4E44
Finally, I'm hit with intense feelings of shame.%K%P

0x4E58
Makoto and I, in order to escape from the infinite loop,%Nmade that promise.%K%N%N

0x4E64
"No matter what happens, never go near that shrine%Nagain..."%K%N%N

0x4E70
The shrine...%K%N

0x4E7C
Now that I think about it... I never told him my reason for%Ngoing to the shrine, why I wanted to go back to the past...%K%N

0x4E88
But I think that's just fine.%K%N

0x4E94
If possible, I want him to forget about that.%K%P

0x4EA8
Just like that day when I headed to the shrine, I touch%Nthe bell in my pocket.%K%N

0x4EB4
As I brush it, its smooth, cold metal feel is transmitted%Nthrough my fingertips.%K%N

0x4EC0
No matter what the time, I can feel safe if I have this bell...%K%P

0x4ECC
First, I need to give Makoto his own bell...%K%N

0x4ED8
I remember Makoto's words as he smiled.%K%N

0x4EE4
Even now, those old-fashioned words are still stuck in%Nmy heart, but the feelings associated with them have%Nchanged.%K%P

0x4EF8
Speaking of changes, Saki's behavior changed.%K%N

0x4F04
Her actions are clearly different from the last loop...%K%N

0x4F10
It seems she's more conscious of Makoto this time%Naround.%K%N

0x4F1C
Makoto and... Saki...%K%N

0x4F28
...The instant I think that, I feel pain in my chest again...%K%P

0x4F78
(Haah... just what am I thinking...?)%K%P

0x4F8C
With this unpleasant feeling coiling up within me, I throw%Nthe covers over my head.%K%P

0x4F98
I try to stop thinking about it.%K%P

0x4FA4
But not being able to see anything is only making me%Nthink even more.%K%P

0x4FB0
I just get even sulkier.%K%P

0x4FBC
(I need to sleep...)%K%P

0x4FC8
I think this.%K%P

0x4FD4
If I do that, then I'll be freed from these incomprehensible%Nfeelings.%K%P

0x4FE0
I close my eyes, and eagerly wait for sleep to take me%Naway...%K%P

0x4FEC
(...Oh, I know! Why don't I try that?)%K%P

0x5028
I jump to my feet from my bed, and run over to the bag I%Nplaced in this room.%K%P

0x5034
I search my bag.%K I'm sure that I hid a small bottle of beer%Nin my luggage...%K%P

0x5040
If I drink a cup of that, then I'll definitely be able to sleep.%K%P

0x504C
A short time later, I find the bottle.%K I forcefully pull it out.%K%P

0x5058
...Huh?%K%P

0x5064
The bottle is empty...%K%P

0x5070
(Wh... Why...?)%K%P

0x508C
(Ugh...! Now that I think about it...)%K%P

0x50B4
(I drank it on the boat here in order to cheer myself up...)%K%P

0x50C0
I sigh, and throw the bottle back into the bag.%K%P

0x50CC
I return to my bed with my shoulders slumped.%K%P

0x50D8
I begin to count imaginary sheep flying above me...%K%P

0x50E4
(1 ...2 ... )%K%P

0x50F0
I feel bitter for using such a childish method to go to%Nsleep.%K%P

0x50FC
(13 ...14 ... )%K%P

0x5108
I throw away all my other thoughts and concentrate%Neverything I've got into counting.%K%P

0x5114
(56 ...57 ... )%K%P

0x5120
I wait impatiently to fall asleep so that I can forget%Neverything...%K%P

0x512C
(196 ...197 ... )%K%P

0x5138
...%K%P

0x5144
—I finally begin to feel myself dozing off.%K%P

0x5150
I feel like I can hear the sound of a small bird chirping%Nfrom somewhere...%K%P

0x515C
I dream of thousands of sheep, going "Baa, baa"%Ncountless times...%K%P
