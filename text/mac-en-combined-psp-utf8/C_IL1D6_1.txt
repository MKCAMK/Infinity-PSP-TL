When we finish talking about the stars, it's already past%N11.%K%P

0x124
Izumi-san told me a variety of stories regarding them,%Nfrom Greek mythology to black holes.%K%P

0x130
Right now, she's sleeping on the second floor.%K%P

0x13C
I...%K%P

0x148
Makoto「Is it all right if I stay here a little longer?」%K%P

0x154
... asked Izumi-san this, as I'd decided to stay here.%K%P

0x160
"A little longer" is a bit of an exaggeration.%K%P

0x16C
I plan to stay here all the way until dawn.%K%P

0x178
I sit down at one of the chairs at the counter, and lie my%Nhead on the table.%K%P

0x184
The shop is absolutely silent...%K%P

0x190
Suddenly, I hear faint sound of something hitting against%Nthe windows.%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「Rain, huh...?」%K%P

0x1A8
I look out the window.%K%P

0x1B4
The vague image of white raindrops in the darkness,%Nilluminated by the street lights, pops up.%K%P

0x1C0
The rain...%K%N

0x1CC
The gently falling... rain...%K%P

0x1D8
Now that I think about it, in that premonition I had... the%Nrain...%K%P

0x224
... was falling.%K%P

0x250
I frantically shake my head.%K%P

0x25C
That's just a hallucination, a horrible delusion; I quickly%Ndismiss it.%K%P

0x268
Makoto「I don't believe in... premonitions.」%K%P

0x274
I assert this in my mind.%K%P

0x280
Makoto「I don't believe in... premonitions.」%K%P

0x28C
I repeat it like a mantra.%K%P

0x298
My attention is drawn to the watch wrapped around my%Nleft wrist.%K%P

0x2A4
—12:30 A.M.%K%P

0x2B0
The date's already changed to the 6th...%K%P

0x2E8
... ... ...%K%P

0x34C
The rain has gone from a drizzle to a downpour.%K%P

0x358
The heavy rain smashes into the ground, forming a thin%Nmist that dyes the surrounding area white.%K%P

0x364
Every time I take a breath, the cold, damp air enters my%Nchest.%K%P

0x370
The rainfall sounds like a roar...%K%P

0x37C
I gaze into the dark sky from the empty shop.%K%P

0x388
Before long...%K%P

0x3A0
Izumi「M-Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x3B4
Izumi「Hold on... why are you here!?」%K%P

0x3C0
... Izumi-san descends the staircase leading to the 2nd%Nfloor.%K%P

0x3CC
Makoto「Oh, Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x3FC
Izumi「Don't say 'Good morning'...」%K%P

0x408
Izumi「Why are you here?」%K%P

0x414
Izumi「Didn't you go home yesterday?」%K%P

0x420
Makoto「No... you see, before I realized it... I fell asleep...」%K%P

0x42C
That's a lie.%K%P

0x438
Last night, I didn't get a wink of sleep.%K%P

0x444
It's not that I couldn't; I just didn't want to.%K%P

0x458
Izumi「In that case, you should have told me...」%K%P

0x464
Izumi「Last night, Kurumi was sleeping over at the lodge, so we%Nhad an extra futon here.」%K%P

0x470
Makoto「But... that would have been...」%K%P

0x47C
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「Well, what I mean is...」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「Wouldn't that mean I would have had to... sleep next to%Nyou?」%K%P

0x4A8
Izumi「Y-Yes...」%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4C0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4E8
Izumi「I might...」%K%P

0x4F4
Izumi「... not have minded that...」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「... What?」%K%P

0x50C
Just when I'm about to ask her to repeat herself...%K%P

0x53C
The shop's door opens.%K%P

0x564
Izumi-san reflexively shifts her gaze towards the%Nentrance.%K%P

0x5AC
Yuka「Good morning♪」%K%P

0x5B8
It's Yuka.%K%P

0x5C4
(What is she doing here so early...?)%K%P

0x5D0
Before I can think any further...%K%P

0x5FC
Haruka「Good morning.」%K%P

0x618
Okuhiko「Damn, this is the pits. It's really raining hard.」%K%P

0x624
... Haruka and Okuhiko come in after her.%K%P

0x640
Izumi「You're all soaked to the bone.」%K%P

0x654
Izumi「Will you wait a minute? I'll go get towels.」%K%P

0x668
Leaving with those words, Izumi-san heads upstairs.%K%P

0x674
Makoto「So, what'd you come here for, Yuka?」%K%P

0x688
Yuka「Hey, what's with that way of talking!?」%K%P

0x694
Yuka「It makes it sound like you didn't want us to come here at%Nall!」%K%P

0x6A0
Makoto「No... that's not what I...」%K%P

0x6BC
Haruka「Breakfast...」%K%P

0x6C8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x6D4
Haruka「We thought we'd come here... to have breakfast.」%K%P

0x6F0
Okuhiko「There's nothing in the fridge, you see.」%K%P

0x6FC
Okuhiko「We thought it'd probably be much quicker if we just went%Nhere.」%K%P

0x708
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x714
Makoto「... Oh, but now that I think about it, where's Kurumi?」%K%P

0x730
Yuka「Kurumi-chan's...」%K%P

0x73C
Haruka「... Looking for a dog.」%K%P

0x748
Makoto「A dog???」%K%P

0x754
Yuka「Did you know? There's this wild dog that lives around%Nhere.」%K%P

0x760
Yuka「Well, I say 'wild dog', but it's actually a little puppy,%Napparently...」%K%P

0x77C
Okuhiko「It's really raining hard, so she probably felt bad for it%Nsince it had to be outside.」%K%P

0x788
Makoto「I see... a puppy...」%K%P

0x79C
Just then...%K%P

0x7A8
—*Thump thump thump thump thump thump*...%K%P

0x7B4
... Izumi-san returns from upstairs.%K%P

0x7C8
Izumi「Thank you for waiting!」%K%P

0x7DC
Izumi「Here's the towels.」%K%P

0x7F8
Yuka「Sorry about this, Izumi-san.」%K%P

0x80C
Izumi「It's fine, you don't have to thank me...」%K%P

0x818
Izumi「Anyway... have you had breakfast?」%K%P

0x834
Okuhiko「No. The truth is, we were hoping you could make some...」%K%P

0x840
Izumi「I see, I understand.」%K%P

0x854
Izumi「Then I'll get to making it right away, so will you sit here%Nand wait?」%K%P

0x868
With that, Izumi-san promptly disappears into the kitchen.%K%P

0x8B8
... ... ...%K%P

0x928
After eating breakfast, we relax and idly pass the time.%K%P

0x93C
Yuka「Even so... there's no customers coming at all, huh?」%K%P

0x948
Izumi「There's nothing that can be done about that. It's still too%Nearly.」%K%P

0x954
Izumi「Besides... with this rain...」%K%P

0x968
Yuka「Aah... I'm feeling kinda melancholic〜」%K%P

0x974
Yuka「Ever since I was little, I've hated rain.」%K%P

0x980
Yuka「It just suspends all my outings and athletic meets...」%K%P

0x99C
Haruka「I... like rain.」%K%P

0x9B8
Okuhiko「Wow. It's rare to like rain, Haruka-chan.」%K%P

0x9CC
Haruka「Is it strange?」%K%P

0x9E0
Okuhiko「N-No... it's not strange, but...」%K%P

0x9FC
Izumi「I like rain too...」%K%P

0xA08
Makoto「Huh? You too?」%K%P

0xA14
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0xA20
Izumi「It's a bit troublesome that no customers are coming... But%NI really love... rainy days...」%K%P

0xA2C
Izumi「I'll sit down by the window and read a book, or go driving%Nwithout a destination in mind.」%K%P

0xA38
Makoto「... Driving?」%K%P

0xA4C
Izumi「Yes... driving on rainy days...」%K%P

0xA58
Izumi「Driving on rainy days, in the middle of the night...」%K%P

0xA64
Izumi「I'll turn off the car radio, and I'll strain my ears in the%Ndarkness to hear the sound of the cold rain falling, and%Nlet it gently echo into my body.」%K%P

0xA70
Everyone「...」%K%P

0xA7C
Izumi「The sound of the tires turning against the water on the%Nroad...」%K%P

0xA88
Izumi「The sound of the rain striking against the car's hood...」%K%P

0xA94
Izumi「The sound of rain... A world wrapped up only in the sound%Nof rain...」%K%P

0xAA8
Izumi「When I hear all of that, for some reason, it's very...%Ncalming to my heart...」%K%P

0xAB4
Izumi「It's as if my own body becomes a transparent drop of%Nwater...」%K%P

0xAC0
Everyone「...」%K%P

0xADC
Haruka「I... feel like I understand that.」%K%P

0xAE8
Yuka「You're right. When you put it that way, then I guess rainy%Ndays aren't all that bad.」%K%P
