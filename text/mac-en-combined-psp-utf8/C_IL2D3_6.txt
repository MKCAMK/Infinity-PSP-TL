Makoto「... That's... ridiculous...」%K%P

0x84
Izumi「Ridiculous... yes, I think so as well.」%K%P

0x90
Izumi「But if that's not it, then you can't explain everything.」%K%P

0x9C
Izumi「For example, the card incident...」%K%P

0x104
Izumi「Makoto-kun, do you actually think it's possible for you to%Nhave memorized the position of all 46 cards?」%K%P

0x110
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x11C
Izumi「That's definitely impossible. There's no way that could%Nhappen.」%K%P

0x128
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you weren't 'remembering' the numbers of%Nthe cards there.」%K%P

0x134
Izumi「Instead... you were just 'creating' the numbers on those%Ncards.」%K%P

0x140
Izumi「The instant you flipped a card, you decided reality so%Nthat it became the same numbers.」%K%P

0x154
Izumi「It's just like the instant you open the lid to decide the%Ncat's life or death status... From within the 'coexisting'%Npossibilities, you picked that one with your own intention.」%K%P

0x160
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x16C
Izumi「And I think that it's likely that your other premonitions...%Nwere the result of the same phenomenon.」%K%P

0x180
Izumi「Because you said 'there's no rice', there was no more%Nrice.」%K%P

0x194
Izumi「Because you said 'an earthquake's coming', the%Nearthquake came.」%K%P

0x1E0
Izumi「'Because you said 'Dinner will be curry', dinner became%Ncurry...」%K%P

0x1EC
Izumi「But on the other hand... if you had said 'Dinner will be%Nstew' at that time...」%K%P

0x1F8
Izumi「Then it might have become a reality where 'Dinner was%Nstew'.」%K%P

0x20C
Izumi「'Because you said 'Dinner will be stew', dinner became%Nstew...」%K%P

0x218
Izumi「But on the other hand... if you had said 'Dinner will be%Nmeat potatoes' at that time...」%K%P

0x224
Izumi「Then it might have become a reality where 'Dinner was%Nmeat potatoes'.」%K%P

0x238
Izumi「'Because you said 'Dinner will be meat potatoes', dinner%Nbecame meat potatoes...」%K%P

0x244
Izumi「But on the other hand... if you had said 'Dinner will be%Ncurry' at that time...」%K%P

0x250
Izumi「Then it might have become a reality where 'Dinner was%Ncurry'.」%K%P

0x264
Izumi「Even now, in this very instant, you are continuing to%Ncreate a new reality.」%K%P

0x270
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x284
Izumi「On Saturday, April 6th, that worst possible incident%Noccurred... But Makoto-kun, no matter what, you were%Nunable to accept that fact known as death.」%K%P

0x2BC
Izumi「And so, I think you decided to freshly create a 'history%Nwith a past where I didn't die'.」%K%P

0x2C8
Izumi「At first, you completely erased all the memories from%Nwithin your head about experiencing those six days to%Nattempt to create a different history.」%K%P

0x2DC
Izumi「But that didn't go well.」%K%P

0x2E8
Izumi「The reason why is because all your memories didn't%Nexist, so in the reality within your delusion, you just%Nrepeated the same actions.」%K%P

0x30C
Izumi「And so, you thought like this next.」%K%P

0x318
"I'll decide to try remembering just a little about the%Nevents of these six days."%K%P

0x324
Izumi「'Just a little...'」%K%P

0x330
Izumi「That's why you decided to erase the specific details in%Nrelation to the 'memories called death', and decided to%Nonly remember a vague, abstract figure of 'someone%Ndead'.」%K%P

0x368
Izumi「But even so, you were unable to change the history%Nwithin your delusion.」%K%P

0x374
Izumi「Reluctantly... you finally decided to use your last resort.」%K%P

0x380
"I'll try undertaking all my memories."%K%P

0x38C
Izumi「However, you decided to hide one thing: The fact that%Nthis 'is a distorted past'.」%K%P

0x398
Izumi「A delusion is something that exists with a perfectly%Nsound rationality in the mind of the person who has it.」%K%P

0x3A4
Izumi「Likewise, you also absolutely couldn't have remembered%Nthe fact that 'You yourself were having a delusion'.」%K%P

0x3F0
Izumi「That's because you had to give rationale and%Npersuasiveness to this imaginary past. And then, you%Ndecided to produce the fictional story of an 'infinite%Nloop'.」%K%P

0x3FC
"Everything in these endlessly repeating six days were%Nreal events."%K%P

0x458
Izumi「It was in order to make yourself firmly believe that 'this%Nwas definitely not a delusion or something'.」%K%P

0x464
Makoto「... Then...」%K%P

0x470
Makoto「... then, right now...」%K%P

0x47C
Makoto「... the Izumi-san before my eyes is also...」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「... nothing more than a... character from my fantasy...?」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「... Right now... the details you're telling me...」%K%P

0x4A0
Makoto「... Aren't actually... being spoken by Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x4AC
Makoto「... But just something... I'm willfully imagining in my head...?」%K%P

0x4B8
Izumi「In your mind, huh?」%K%P

0x4C4
Izumi「Yes, I think that it's probably in your mind.」%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi「The moment you create a history in which I don't die, you%Ngo back to the true, real world.」%K%P

0x4DC
Izumi「In the instant that's done, the infinite loop will come into%Nexistence as an real event.」%K%P

0x4E8
Izumi「This means the world you exist in will reach the point%Nwhere it becomes reality and exists as the true, real%Nhistory.」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「... Within me... in the world I exist in...」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「I don't understand what you're saying, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「In the first place, you've just explained me, but what%Nabout you!?」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「The reason you time traveled... you're not saying that%Neven that's a delusion, are you!?」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「If that's the case, then what about my existence!?」%K%P

0x530
Makoto「Are you saying the person known as me is nothing but%Nan existence in your delusion!?」%K%P

0x554
Izumi「... Yes...」%K%P

0x560
Makoto「—It's not 'yes', is it!?」%K%P

0x588
Makoto「I'm a human who has his own personality!」%K%P

0x594
Makoto「I'm not a fictional character created by your%Nconsciousness!」%K%P

0x5A0
Izumi「... Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x5AC
Izumi「In the first place, reality is something that can only be%Njudged subjectively, right?」%K%P

0x5B8
Izumi「The reality within you is can only be seen by you... and%Nthe reality within me can only be seen by me.」%K%P

0x5C4
Izumi「The world around you is your own world... and the world%Naround me is my own world.」%K%P

0x5D0
Izumi「If your consciousness was annihilated, that would also%Nmark the end of your world... If my consciousness was%Ndestroyed, then my world would also disappear.」%K%P

0x5DC
Izumi「It's the same with this reality...」%K%P

0x5E8
Izumi「To you, it's the delusion that sprouted within you... and to%Nme, it's the delusion that sprouted within me.」%K%P

0x5F4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x600
Izumi「Although I witnessed 'the scene of Makoto-kun dead',%Nright now, I'm trying to create another history...」%K%P

0x60C
Izumi「The moment I create a history in which you, Makoto-kun,%Ndon't die, I'll go back to the true, real world...」%K%P

0x618
Izumi「In my world, the one afflicted with Curé Syndrome wasn't%Nyou...」%K%P

0x624
Izumi「—It was me.」%K%P

0x630
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x63C
Izumi「Even though I hadn't done anything to you yet,%NMakoto-kun, you correctly guessed future events one%Nafter another.」%K%P

0x648
Izumi「When I saw that, I realized it was a phenomenon that%Ncould only be described as a 'miracle'.」%K%P

0x654
Izumi「... That's right... I actually witnessed a 'miracle'.」%K%P

0x660
Izumi「As a matter of course, I reached the point where I firmly%Nbelieved in The Third Trait of Curé Syndrome.」%K%P

0x66C
Izumi「In other words, I reached the point where I embraced the%Ndelusion that 'delusions become reality'.」%K%P

0x678
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x68C
Izumi「Before long, the 'worst situation' arrived...」%K%P

0x698
Izumi「... your...」%K%P

0x6A4
Izumi「... death...」%K%P

0x6B0
Izumi「The me who saw that scene strongly wished this.」%K%P

0x6BC
"I want to go back to the past. I want to go back to the%Npast and completely change history."%K%P

0x6C8
"And now, I know that this is possible."%K%P

0x6D4
"I know delusions can become reality."%K%P

0x6E0
"A strong thought can produce a new reality."%K%P

0x6F4
Izumi「The next instant, it was arranged so that my delusion to%Nseek another possibility began.」%K%P

0x700
Izumi「I had no doubts that Curé Syndrome had already%Nsettled within me.」%K%P

0x70C
Izumi「I just firmly believed... from the bottom of my heart...」%K%P

0x718
Izumi「That my intention could change history...」%K%P

0x734
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x740
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x74C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x758
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x764
A heavy silence reigns between us.%K%P

0x770
The wind suddenly stops blowing.%K%P

0x77C
Our surroundings are wrapped up in a complete silence,%Nwhere not even the leaves make noise.%K%P

0x788
The clouds slowly stream by... The moonlight begins to%Ndisappear...%K%P

0x794
Darkness slowly creeps through the cracks on the%Ntombstones.%K%P

0x7A0
Izumi-san is across the deep darkness...%K%N

0x7AC
Her features slowly dissolve into it...%K%P

0x7B8
—Like she's a delusion.%K%N

0x7C4
—A fantasy.%K%N

0x7D0
—An illusion.%K%P

0x7DC
Makoto「Bullshit!」%K%P

0x7E8
I instinctively stand up.%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「There's no way some bullshit like that is true!」%K%P

0x800
Makoto「It has nothing to do with Curé Syndrome or%NSchrödinger!」%K%P

0x80C
Makoto「I'm currently existing here right now, and Izumi-san is%Nreally here, in the flesh, sitting down before me!」%K%P

0x818
Makoto「That's the truth!」%K%P

0x824
Makoto「That's the only reality!」%K%P

0x838
I reach out my hands, and firmly grab Izumi-san's%Nshoulders.%K%P

0x860
Her thin shoulders...%K%N

0x86C
They almost feel like they could break right now...%K%P

0x878
Makoto「See...」%K%P

0x884
I mutter this, and embrace Izumi-san.%K%P

0x898
I hug her... tightly...%K%N

0x8A4
So that she doesn't go anywhere...%K%N

0x8B0
Like this, she can't disappear...%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「You're here, aren't you...?」%K%P

0x8C8
Makoto「You're here, right...?」%K%P

0x8D4
Makoto「You're actually by my side right now, right...?」%K%P

0x8E0
Warmth is overflowing into my arms.%K%N

0x8EC
Her warm breaths permeated through my chest.%K%P

0x8F8
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x904
Izumi「Thank you...」%K%P

0x910
Izumi「It's all right...」%K%P

0x91C
Izumi「Because... I understand...」%K%P

0x928
Izumi「Because... I'll always believe...」%K%P

0x934
Izumi「That's why I said it at the beginning...」%K%P

0x940
Izumi「That's why I wanted to say it in advance no matter what%Nbefore we began talking...」%K%P

0x94C
Izumi「'What's more important than whether it's true or not is%Nwhether you can believe it or not'...」%K%P

0x958
Makoto「Regulus, huh...」%K%P

0x964
While embracing Izumi-san, I raise my head and look up.%K%P

0x978
Even though the moonlight is blocked by the clouds, the%Nstars are still shining brightly.%K%P

0x984
The many radiant lights are spread out in the deep, dark%Nblue darkness.%K%P

0x990
Why does the distant, endless starry sky feel so%Nextremely close right now?%K%P

0x99C
It feels like if I reached out my hand, I could touch those%Nlights.%K%P

0x9A8
The stars are definitely shining.%K%P

0x9B4
At this very instant, those stars are shining.%K%P

0x9C8
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x9D4
Izumi「Everything I've said up until now have been the words of%Nthe me as a psychologist.」%K%P

0x9E0
Izumi「The real me will always only believe in this reality before%Nme.」%K%P

0x9EC
Izumi「Because I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0x9F8
Izumi「Because I want to believe in this warmth...」%K%P

0xA04
Izumi-san presses her forehead against my chest.%K%P

0xA10
She rubs it against me countless times, like a spoiled%Nkitten.%K%P

0xA1C
The tip of her nose tickles my chest.%K%P

0xA28
"Don't forget this warmth, all right?"%K%P

0xA34
"Don't forget... my existence, all right?"%K%P

0xA40
Those are the words Izumi-san said to me just a little%Nwhile ago.%K%P

0xA4C
I finally understand the true meaning behind those words.%K%P

0xA58
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0xA64
Makoto「I believe it too...」%K%P

0xA70
Makoto「I believe in your warmth...」%K%P

0xA7C
Makoto「Because I'll always be there...」%K%P

0xA88
Makoto「I'll always be there by your side...」%K%P

0xA94
Makoto「That's why I don't want to talk about any more foolish%Nthings...」%K%P

0xAA0
Makoto「To me, you're neither a psychologist or a professor...」%K%P

0xAAC
Makoto「Just a...」%K%P

0xAB8
Makoto「... goddess...」%K%P

0xAC4
Izumi「... What?」%K%P

0xAD0
Izumi-san asks me to repeat myself, but I don't answer.%K%P

0xADC
I don't think I need to answer.%K%P

0xAE8
I just embrace her harder... I feel that's all the answer I%Nneed.%K%P

0xAF4
When I come to my senses, the wind has returned.%K%P

0xB00
The night wind carries the scent of her hair, a sweet%Nsmell that I could melt into.%K%P

0xB14
We continue to silently embrace each other as Leo%Nwatches over us...%K%P
