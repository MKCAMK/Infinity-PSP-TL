When we return to the lodge, I take a bath, brush my%Nteeth, and lie down on the bed.%K%P

0x4C
I'm planning on going out tonight, so I don't change into%Nmy nightclothes.%K%P

0x58
Wearing my normal clothes, I blankly stare at the ceiling.%K%P

0x64
Just then...%K%P

0x8C
Someone knocks on my door.%K%P

0xA4
The quiet, gentle knock is like a whisper.%K%P

0xB0
Now that I think about it, around this time on the last 2nd, I%Ninvited Haruka to go fishing with me.%K%P

0xBC
... Which means... this is Haruka?%K%P

0xC8
Makoto「Come on in.」%K%P

0xF0
As soon as I speak, the person opens the door,%Nrevealing themselves to be...%K%P

0x138
Makoto「I-Izumi-san!?」%K%P

0x14C
Izumi「Shh! Keep your voice down!」%K%P

0x158
Makoto「W-Why are you here, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x17C
Izumi「Well... I thought you might be concerned...」%K%P

0x188
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x194
Izumi「The conversation we had this afternoon... Don't you want%Nto hear the rest of it?」%K%P

0x1A0
Makoto「Y-Yeah... so you came here to finish it?」%K%P

0x1AC
Izumi「Besides that, I know you wanted to hear it no matter%Nwhat...」%K%P

0x1B8
Izumi「You wanted to know... my thoughts...」%K%P

0x1CC
As she says this, Izumi-san slowly sits down by the%Nbedside.%K%P

0x1E0
Izumi「However, I didn't get a chance to talk to you.」%K%P

0x1EC
Makoto「The truth is, I was thinking of going to Lunabeach tonight.」%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「So it's actually pretty good that you came here...」%K%P

0x20C
Izumi-san lightly nods countless times, and gently looks%Ninto my eyes.%K%P

0x218
However, for a brief moment, I catch a glimpse of a%Nshadow within that kindness.%K%P

0x224
It seems that there's a pain lurking deep in her heart%Nthat she's enduring with all she's got...%K%P

0x238
Izumi「Makoto-kun? Ready?」%K%P

0x244
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x258
Izumi「Concerning this story, I'm not sure how to talk about it...」%K%P

0x264
Izumi「It's very... complex.」%K%P

0x270
Izumi「The cause of the time travel...」%K%P

0x27C
Izumi「The issue of your memories...」%K%P

0x288
Izumi「This situation we've been placed in now...」%K%P

0x294
Izumi「It all comes from a phenomenon that cannot be%Nexplained from just one perspective.」%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2B4
Izumi「That's why, for sure... I don't think you'll understand this.」%K%P

0x2C8
Izumi「No, I don't mean that I think it'll be too difficult to%Nunderstand...」%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi「It's just... extremely remote from common sense...」%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2F4
Izumi「First... about 'Curé Syndrome'...」%K%P

0x300
Izumi「I'll begin by talking about that...」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「W-Wait a minute!」%K%P

0x318
Makoto「'Curé Syndrome'...」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「Is that somehow connected to the time travel?」%K%P

0x338
Izumi「I think that's something you can judge for yourself after%NI'm done talking.」%K%P

0x344
Izumi「If you don't believe this story, then it's fine...」%K%P

0x350
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x35C
Izumi「Anyway, will you listen to my story all the way to the end?」%K%P

0x368
Makoto「... Y-Yes.」%K%P

0x38C
Izumi-san firmly grips the bed sheets.%K%P

0x398
She straightens them, messes them, and keeps%Nrepeating these monotonous actions while searching%Nfor the chance to open up.%K%P

0x3A4
Her eyes dart around the room as she runs a hand%Nthrough her hair. Finally, Izumi-san takes a small breath,%Nand begins talking.%K%P

0x3D4
Izumi「This is something that I haven't told Okuhiko...」%K%P

0x3E0
Izumi「I only mentioned two traits of Curé Syndrome%Nyesterday...」%K%P

0x3EC
Izumi「But there's actually one more...」%K%P

0x3F8
Izumi「The very essential 'Third Trait'...」%K%P

0x404
Makoto「The Third... Trait...?」%K%P

0x410
Izumi-san nods.%K%P

0x41C
Her gaze is so serious that it's almost frightening...%K%P

0x428
Izumi「Makoto-kun, do you remember?」%K%P

0x434
Izumi「Yesterday, I summed up the First and Second Traits as%Nthe 'spreading of delusions', right?」%K%P

0x440
Izumi「But you know what? The phenomenon of the 'spreading%Nof delusions' isn't actually something that uncommon.」%K%P

0x44C
Izumi「Because the symptoms had already been categorized%Nas a type of another illness, Dr. Cabin didn't have to%Ndefine them anew.」%K%P

0x458
Makoto「Izumi-san, sorry, but can you put that in layman's terms?」%K%P

0x46C
Izumi「Hmm... in short, it was...」%K%P

0x478
Izumi「'The delusion that someone embraces begins to be%Nprojected onto another person.'」%K%P

0x484
Izumi「But that mental illness was already called 'Shared%NPsychotic Disorder', so it wasn't anything particularly%Nnew or unusual either.」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「So then... it was like this?」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「In short, when examining Tom's symptoms, Dr. Cabin%Ndiscovered a different trait that wasn't part of 'Shared%NPsychotic Disorder'—'The Third Trait'.」%K%P

0x4A8
Makoto「That's precisely why he had to define it with a new name:%N'Curé Syndrome'.」%K%P

0x4BC
Izumi「Yes, that's right...」%K%P

0x4C8
Makoto「So? What's this 'Third Trait'?」%K%P

0x4D4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x4E0
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x4F4
Izumi「I don't think you'll believe this, but...」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「'Won't believe this'... You said that earlier too...」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「Is it that incredible?」%K%P

0x520
Izumi「... Yes...」%K%P

0x52C
Izumi「... To put it in one word...」%K%P

0x538
Izumi「... It's an abnormality...」%K%P

0x544
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x550
Izumi「If 'The Third Trait' is actually true, then it might overturn%Nthe foundation of the way things are in this world...」%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x570
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x57C
Izumi「Calmly listen to me.」%K%P

0x588
Izumi「About Curé Syndrome's 'Third Trait'.」%K%P

0x594
Izumi「The truth is, it's related to the 'Schrödinger's cat' Kurumi%Nwas talking about.」%K%P

0x5A0
Makoto「Schrödinger's cat!?」%K%P

0x5C4
—Then, just before she can reply!%K%P

0x618
Haruka「Ah...」%K%P

0x624
Makoto「H-Haruka!」%K%P

0x640
Izumi「Haruka-chan!」%K%P

0x654
Haruka「Why are... you here?」%K%P

0x660
Haruka furrows her eyebrows, and tilts her head slightly.%K%P

0x66C
Her gaze alternates between Izumi-san and I.%K%P

0x680
Izumi「E-Er... umm...」%K%P

0x694
Haruka「???」%K%P

0x6A0
Makoto「I brought her with me!」%K%P

0x6AC
I instinctively blurt these words out of my mouth.%K%P

0x6C0
Haruka「You did?」%K%P

0x6CC
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x6D8
Haruka「Why?」%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「Well, um...」%K%P

0x6F0
Makoto「... You see, I had a lot of things I wanted to ask her about%Nthe Seminar Camp...」%K%P

0x6FC
Haruka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x710
Izumi「Haruka-chan, is something wrong?」%K%P

0x71C
Haruka「I have something to ask Makoto.」%K%P

0x728
Makoto「M-Me?」%K%P

0x734
Makoto「Could you be talking about... fishing?」%K%P

0x748
Haruka「Y-Yes... that's right...」%K%P

0x754
Haruka「I wanted you to teach me how to fish...」%K%P

0x760
Haruka「But how did you know that?」%K%P

0x76C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x778
Makoto「Th-That's... well, how do I put it...」%K%P

0x784
Makoto「Intuition... I suppose?」%K%P

0x798
(Great...)%K%P

0x7A4
(Why do we have to keep getting interrupted like this?)%K%P

0x7B0
(Just when we were getting to the most important part of%Nall times...)%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka must have heard us talking, for she comes in next.%K%P

0x7F4
Yuka「Ah! Izumi-san! What are you doing here!?」%K%P

0x810
Haruka「Makoto... brought her to his room.」%K%P

0x81C
Makoto「D-Don't put it like that!」%K%P

0x84C
Yuka「Hold on, what's with that?」%K%P

0x858
Yuka「Is this true, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x874
Izumi「Y-Yes... in a way...」%K%P

0x880
Makoto「I-Izumi-san, why are you-」%K%P

0x89C
Haruka「But didn't you say... that you brought her here?」%K%P

0x8A8
Makoto「Yes, but that's all I said! The way you said makes it%Nsound like Izumi-san and I were... going to...」%K%P

0x8C4
Yuka「Geez, Makoto! There's no use in arguing!」%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka「Bringing the 'Professor' to your room, of all people...」%K%P

0x8E4
Yuka「For God's sake, you've got some nerve...」%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x904
Yuka「There, there, Izumi-san, you're not hurt, are you?」%K%P

0x910
Yuka「It's late now, so come and sleep in my room.」%K%P

0x924
Izumi「H-Huh? Th-That's all right, you don't need to...」%K%P

0x930
Izumi「Besides, if I don't go back to the shop, Kurumi will-」%K%P

0x94C
Kurumi「Onee-chan, why did you come here?」%K%P

0x960
Izumi「K-Kurumi...」%K%P

0x96C
Kurumi「You disappeared so suddenly! Kurumi was looking for%Nyou!」%K%P

0x988
Yuka「As you can see, there's no need to worry.」%K%P

0x994
Yuka「Well? What do you say, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x9A0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x9AC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9C8
Okuhiko「Huh? What's going on?」%K%P

0x9D4
Okuhiko「Why is everyone gathered here?」%K%P

0xA1C
... ... ...%K%P

0xA44
And so, Izumi-san and Kurumi decide to sleep in Yuka's%Nroom tonight.%K%P

0xA50
I promise to go fishing with Haruka, and crawl under the%Ncovers of my bed.%K%P

0xA5C
"Time travel."%K

0xA68
"The infinite loop."%K

0xA74
"The mystery of our memories."%K%N

0xA80
"The true nature of the bell."%K

0xA8C
"The Third Trait."%K

0xA98
"Schrödinger's cat."%K%P

0xAA4
Just how are they all connected?%K%P

0xAB0
I want to ask Izumi-san about the truth right now.%K%P

0xABC
But even though I want to, I can't.%K%P

0xAC8
She's asleep now, stuck between Yuka and Kurumi like a%Nsandwich.%K%P

0xAD4
(Ah... just what is this "Schrödinger's cat"!?)%K%P

0xAE0
(What is "The Third Trait"!!?)%K%P

0xAEC
(How are they related the infinite loop!!!?)%K%P

0xAF8
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0xB04
Alone in the dark, all I can do is sigh...%K%P
