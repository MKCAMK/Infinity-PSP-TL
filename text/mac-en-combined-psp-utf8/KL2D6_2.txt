Something cold and wet hits me on the forehead over%Nand over again...%K%P

0xC8
(Rain, huh...?)%K%P

0xD4
The rain helps me come to my senses.%W%W%W%K%P

0xE0
That's right... I've got to go...%K%P

0xEC
I have to hurry... and find Kurumi...%K

0x658
Go to the shrine.

0x664
Try looking somewhere else.

0x158
My destination is obvious.%K%N

0x164
Of course, it's the shrine.%K%P

0x170
Kurumi will definitely go to that shrine.%K%P

0x17C
And even if for argument's sake she doesn't go, then%Nhistory still won't repeat itself.%K%P

0x188
There's no hesitation within me.%K%P

0x194
(Anyway, if I don't hurry up and get there...)%K%P

0x1A0
I endure the pain, and begin to walk towards the shrine,%Ndragging my legs along...%K%P

0x20C
By the time I arrive in front of the long staircase, the%Ndrizzle has became a constant rain.%K%P

0x218
I wipe off the raindrops from my soaked forehead with%Nthe back of my hand.%K%P

0x224
My legs have already fallen numb.%K%N

0x230
I do my best to raise my heavy legs, and step on the%Nfirst step of the staircase.%K%P

0x23C
I lose my balance, but although it seems like I'm going to%Nfall, I manage to regain my posture with one of my hands.%K%P

0x248
Just like that, I slowly and carefully ascend the long%Nstaircase...%K%P

0x25C
In the deep darkness, the shrine stands out like%Nsomething faintly white against a dark background.%K%P

0x268
The raindrops pelting the roof become a thin mist that%Nenvelops the shrine.%K%P

0x274
Its faint and gray appearance makes it look like a mirage.%K%P

0x280
It's the exact same scene as that day.%K%N

0x28C
The ground is violently pounded by swarms of large rain%Ndrops...%K%N

0x298
The world is dominated by the sound of rainfall...%K%P

0x2A4
My body is soaking wet, chilled to the bone.%K%P

0x2B0
I can barely move my cold body.%K%P

0x2BC
I move stiffly, staggering through the deep water%Npuddle...%K%P

0x33C
In the darkness of the dreary shrine... I don't see Kurumi.%K%P

0x348
In pain, I sit down by the entrance.%K%P

0x354
I firmly stare at the shrine's grounds, hazy from the rain.%K%N

0x360
I draw my body close, and shiver as I try to warm up.%K%P

0x36C
I place my cold, icy fingers in my pockets.%K%P

0x378
—I feel... something.%K%P

0x3AC
I gently start to pull it out.%W%W%W%K%P

0x3B8
It's "me".%K%N

0x3C4
The "me" that Kurumi folded...%K%P

0x3E0
Kurumi「This is...」%K%P

0x3EC
Kurumi「... Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x3F8
Kurumi「This is Onii-chan when he's smiling!」%K%P

0x404
I take the soaking wet origami and stroke it gently.%K%P

0x410
(Kurumi...)%K%P

0x41C
Kurumi will definitely come here.%K%P

0x428
But when she does, just what should I do...? I think about%Nit.%K%P

0x434
Healing her scar...%K%N

0x440
Removing her emotional scars...%K%P

0x44C
(If I can make her believe me about her blood%Nrelationship with Izumi-san...%K%P

0x458
Kurumi definitely time traveled here from this shrine.%K%P

0x464
(Time travel—just how the hell can I prove that?)%K%P

0x470
I continue to wait for Kurumi while watching the white%Nraindrops flow down from the edge of the eaves.%K%P

0x47C
(Kurumi's smile...)%K%P

0x488
(I don't want to lose that angelic smile...)%K%P

0x494
Only the origami on my palm is emitting any faint heat...%K%P

0x520
Before long, the morning has quietly arrived.%K%N

0x52C
The rain is still strong... It hasn't weakened one bit.%K%P

0x538
A deep, thick fog rises around the shrine's grounds.%K%P

0x544
In that snow white fog, a faint, small figure appears...%K%P

0x550
Countless raindrops crash against the figure's thin%Narms and soft hair.%K%P

0x55C
It seems as if the figure's body is wrapped in a band of%Nholy light.%K%P

0x568
The completely soaking wet girl totters forward, her%Nhead hung downwards.%K%P

0x574
She hasn't noticed me yet.%K%P

0x580
And then, when she reaches the dead center of the%Nlong stone paving...%K%N

0x58C
... I stand up.%K%P
