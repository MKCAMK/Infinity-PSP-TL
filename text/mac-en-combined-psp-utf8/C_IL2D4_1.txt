Ten minutes have already passed since the crab's last%Nsumo match.%K%P

0x68
Kurumi and I are crouching down by the shore, blankly%Nstaring at the ocean.%K%P

0x74
Endless waves come on after another from beyond the%Nhorizon, each one being different from the last.%K%P

0x80
I wonder why it is that I never get tired of staring at%Nthem?%K%P

0x8C
A group of small white bubbles wash up on the beach%Nwith each wave...%K%P

0x98
Then the next approaching wave will swallow them up,%Nleaving no trace of them behind.%K%P

0x130
Makoto「When I was a kid, I used to love pulling pranks with water%Nguns and water balloons...」%K%P

0x144
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x150
Makoto「But why are you asking me this?」%K%P

0x164
Kurumi「Umm... well, you see... Err... err...」%K%P

0x170
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x184
Kurumi「Kurumi likes it!」%K%P

0x190
Kurumi「Kurumi also loves water!」%K%P

0x1A4
Makoto「Hmm... well, I guess I would say that I don't like it.」%K%P

0x1B0
Makoto「Baths are so troublesome that if possible, I'd rather not%Nhave them...」%K%P

0x1C4
Kurumi「Hmm... is that so...」%K%P

0x1D0

Kurumi「Kurumi loves water!」%K%P

0x224
Kurumi「Kurumi loves floating in the water.」%K%P

0x238
Kurumi「Like a jellyfish... calmly... leisurely...」%K%P

0x244
Kurumi「When she does that, it feels kinda nostalgic...」%K%P

0x250
Kurumi「It's so warm and calm... Being like that makes Kurumi want%Nto dissolve into the water...」%K%P

0x25C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x268
Kurumi「That's why Kurumi... really wanted to go with everyone.」%K%P

0x274
Kurumi「To the pool... and the hot springs...」%K%P

0x280
Makoto「Well, if you wanted to, then why didn't you? It's okay, isn't%Nit...?」%K%P

0x294
The instant I say this, Kurumi's expression suddenly%Ngrows dim.%K%P

0x2A0
Her shoulders drop, her eyes go down, and she plays%Nwith the sand by her feet with her fingertips.%K%P

0x2B8
Kurumi「She was scared...」%K%P

0x2C4
Kurumi「She was scared everyone would hate her...」%K%P

0x2D0
Hate???%K%P

0x308
Kurumi「There's a scar... on Kurumi's back.」%K%P

0x314
Kurumi「It's a deep scar... that looks as if it were cut and gouged%Nout by a saw...」%K%P

0x320
Kurumi「The doctors said she got it when Kurumi was a baby... in%Naddition to that, they say it probably happened shortly%Nafter she was born.」%K%P

0x32C
Kurumi「But you know what? Papa, Mama, and Onee-chan are%Nlying to Kurumi.」%K%P

0x338
Kurumi「They told Kurumi that she got that scar when she fell%Ndown the stairs when she was three.」%K%P

0x344
Kurumi「Even though no matter how you look at it, there's no way%NKurumi could have gotten that scar... from falling down%Nthe stairs...」%K%P

0x350
I don't say anything. I don't know what I should say.%K%P

0x35C
After hearing Kurumi's unexpected confession, all I can%Ndo is silently listen to her story.%K%P

0x368
Kurumi「And you know what else? This scar... has given Kurumi%Nquite a few painful memories...」%K%P

0x374
Kurumi「In middle school... there was this boy Kurumi was into...」%K%P

0x380
Kurumi「He was a senpai older than Kurumi, but... whether it was%Nstudying or playing, he taught Kurumi several things...」%K%P

0x38C
Kurumi「Every day, when school ended, we would stop by this%Nnearby park, and chat about trivial things...」%K%P

0x398
Kurumi「Even though it was just trivial chat, to Kurumi, those were%Nprecious times. Very... precious...」%K%P

0x3A4
Kurumi「Kurumi... loved... that senpai...」%K%P

0x3B0
Kurumi「But you know what? One day, that senpai... stopped%Ntalking to Kurumi... He wouldn't say a single word to her...」%K%P

0x3BC
Kurumi「He wouldn't even exchange glances with her when we%Npassed in the hallways...」%K%P

0x3C8
Kurumi「After school... Kurumi was all alone at the park, swinging%Non the swing...」%K%P

0x3D4
Kurumi「She stayed there until night... alone all that whole time...%Nswinging away... swinging away...」%K%P

0x3E0
Kurumi「Kurumi heard the reason why that senpai stopped%Ntalking to her from her friends later...」%K%P

0x3F4
... ...%K%P

0x400
Senpai「That girl's got this giant scar on her back!」%K%P

0x40C
Senpai「I dunno know how she got it, but... at any rate, I'm%Ncompletely through with her.」%K%P

0x418
Senpai「There's no way in hell I can go with her to the beach with%Nthat disgusting scar!」%K%P

0x424
Senpai「It'd be way too embarrassing...」%K%P

0x430
Senpai「Yes, that's right. That's why I'm ignoring her!」%K%P

0x43C
Senpai「She's nothing more than a nuisance to me at this point!」%K%P

0x448
... ...%K%P

0x488
Kurumi「To be honest... it was a great shock...」%K%P

0x494
Kurumi「It left a scar on Kurumi much deeper than the one on her%Nback...」%K%P

0x4A0
Kurumi「Ever since then, Kurumi's been afraid to show her back in%Nfront of other people...」%K%P

0x4AC
Kurumi「Yes... That's the reason... why Kurumi didn't go to the pool%Nand hot springs with everyone else...」%K%P

0x4B8
I'm incredibly angry. So angry that my body is shaking%Nfrom it.%K%P

0x4C4
I want to drag that senpai here and beat the living shit%Nout of him.%K%P

0x4D0
I want to kick him until his bones break, and throw him to%Nthe bottom of the sea...%K%P

0x4DC
Without realizing it, I clench my hands into tight fists.%K%P

0x4E8
Kurumi「Up until now... Kurumi's never told anyone about this...」%K%P

0x4F4
Kurumi「And Kurumi thinks she probably won't tell it to anyone%Nafter this...」%K%P

0x500
Kurumi「You're the only one who knows this, Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x514
Kurumi「Kurumi only told you because you're Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x520
Kurumi「... So don't... tell anyone else...」%K%P

0x534
When she finishes speaking, Kurumi grows silent.%K%P

0x540
I'm... searching for the right words.%K%P

0x54C
I have to say something.%K%P

0x558
But no matter how hard I try, I can't find the right words.%K%P

0x564
It feels like it would be wrong if I tried to cheerfully%Nencourage her, or to try comforting her by being%Nsympathetic...%K%P

0x570
I grow more and more quiet as I struggle over thinking up%Nways to distract Kurumi from her pain.%K%P

0x58C
—And, right after that!%K%P

0x5E8
—WHAM!%K%P

0x5F4
The earth abruptly rumbles from a violent shock wave.%K%P

0x614
Kurumi「Kyaa!」%K%P

0x628
Kurumi lets out a short scream, and plunges towards my%Nchest.%K%P

0x634
Surprised by this unforeseen shock wave, I quickly lose%Nmy balance, and fall onto the sand.%K%P

0x640
Kurumi is tightly clinging to my chest...%K%P

0x64C
Before I realize it, I'm embracing her body.%K%P

0x658
Before long...%K%P

0x6A8
... The ground's shaking finally fades away, and all is%Nsilent.%K%P

0x6B4
The only evidence of it having occurred... is the two of%Nus, lying on top of each other.%K%P

0x6C0
My palm is touching Kurumi's back.%K%P

0x6CC
Though my hand is on top of her clothes, I can clearly%Nfeel something through it.%K%P

0x6D8
—It's a very deeply engraved scar.%K%N

0x6E4
—I can feel rough bulges protruding unnaturally on%Nthe otherwise smooth surface of her bare skin.%K%P

0x6F0
Kurumi's sadness is passing itself through my palm.%K%P

0x6FC
It manifests as a throbbing pain coming from my chest.%K%P

0x708
Makoto「Kurumi...」%K%P

0x714
Kurumi「It's all right...」%K%P

0x720
Kurumi「Please... don't say anything...」%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x738
Kurumi「In exchange...」%K%P

0x744
Kurumi「Can we...」%K%P

0x750
Kurumi「Can we stay like this... for just a little while?」%K%P

0x75C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x768
Kurumi「When we're like this... Kurumi feels very calm...」%K%P

0x774
Kurumi「Like she's floating... in the water...」%K%P

0x780
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x78C
Kurumi「Onii-chan, your chest is...」%K%P

0x798
Kurumi「... warm...」%K%P

0x7A4
The feeling of Kurumi's scar wraps up around my hand.%K%P

0x7B0
I feel myself boiling with rage from within.%K%P

0x7BC
(—This thing should just disappear!)%K%P

0x7C8
This strong thought can't help but worm its way into my%Nhead.%K%P

0x7D4
The scorching sun beats down on me...%K%P

0x7E0
All I'm able to do right now is continue to hold her like this.%K%P

0x818
