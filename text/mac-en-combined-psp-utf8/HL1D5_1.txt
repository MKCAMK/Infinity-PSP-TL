—*Knock*, *knock*! *Knock*, *knock*! Someone's%Nknocking on the door.%K%P

0x140
(Mmm... Mmm〜...)%K%P

0x14C
(Who would come over... so late at night...?)%K%P

0x158
I get up from the bed while I rub my sleepy eyes.%K%P

0x180
The knocking continues.%K%N

0x18C
I walk over to the door, and open it.%K%P

0x3B0
—Wham!%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x3E4
It's Haruka.%K%N

0x3F0
It seems she'd banged her forehead on the door, as%Nshe's now rubbing it with a sheepish smile.%K%P

0x3FC
Makoto「Ah... Did I do that just now?」%K%P

0x410
Haruka「No, that's not it. I was slightly half-asleep...」%K%P

0x41C
Makoto「Really? You were knocking rather loudly for someone%Nwho was just 'half-asleep'...」%K%P

0x430
Haruka「Ah, th-that's...」%K%P

0x43C
She falls silent.%K%P

0x448
Haruka's acting kind of funny right now.%K%N

0x454
She's obviously in some kind of hurry.%K%N

0x460
She probably fell silent because she sees that I didn't%Nbuy her act, and now doesn't know what to say next.%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「Sorry. I was just teasing you there.」%K%P

0x480
Haruka「'Teasing'?」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「Yeah, exactly.」%K%P

0x498
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「So, what's up?」%K%P

0x4B0
Haruka「Forget it.」%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「Huh? Why are you telling me to forget it when you've%Ncome all the way here...?」%K%P

0x4C8
Haruka「Well, it seems like you were sound asleep.」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Well, yeah... it's really late and I value my sleep.」%K%P

0x4E0
Haruka「I see... just because I can't sleep doesn't mean that%Nothers can't either...」%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「Of course. It's considered rude to wake people up like%Nthat, you know.」%K%P

0x500
Haruka「I'm... sorry.」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「Hmm... well, if you understand, it's fine.」%K%P

0x518
Haruka「Well then, good night.」%K%P

0x52C
As Haruka turns her back towards me, I impulsively call%Nout for her to stop.%K%P

0x538
Makoto「H-Hey! Hold on!」%K%P

0x54C
Haruka「Huh?」%K%P

0x558
Makoto「You can't sleep, right? And besides, didn't you have%Nsomething you wanted to say to me?」%K%P

0x564
Haruka「Just now, I said good night. And you also said that you%Nwere sound asleep.」%K%P

0x570
Haruka's words sting, as if they had slapped me right%Nacross the face. I gawk at her, speechless.%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x590
Haruka「Isn't this what you call being 'teased'?」%K%P

0x59C
Haruka turns around to give me a wide, impish smile.%K%P

0x5A8
She's beaming. It's the first time I've ever seen an%Nexpression like that on her face.%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「You pick up on things way too easily...」%K%P

0x5C0
When she sees how embarrassed I am, Haruka covers%Nher mouth and giggles. I heave a sigh.%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「So, what's up?」%K%P

0x5E0
Haruka「There's a favor I'd like to ask you...」%K%P

0x5EC
Haruka... wants to ask me a favor? Just what could it be?%K%P

0x5F8
Haruka「U-Umm... I couldn't sleep last night either. So when I took a%Nwalk outside by myself... I saw some shiranui. I think it was%Nabout 4:30 in the morning...」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「Shiranui? You mean like will-o'-the-wisps?」%K%P

0x610
Haruka「Right, shiranui... They were very pretty... That's why I was%Nthinking of going to see them again tonight.」%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「And you want me to go with you?」%K%P

0x628
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0x634
Well, I don't see why not. I turn on my watch light to check%Nthe time.%K%P

0x640
Makoto「Sure, but it's only 1:00. Isn't that too early? I think it'd be%Nbest if we got some more sleep, even if it's only for a%Nlittle bit.」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「Because I'm sure tomorrow will also get busy... I can lend%Nyou my watch, if you'd like.」%K%P

0x658
Haruka「No, I'll be fine. Well then, I'll let you sleep for a bit, then%Ncome to wake you up afterwards.」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「Okay. I'll leave the door unlocked so that you can wake%Nme up if I'm still asleep.」%K%P

0x670
Haruka「All right, I understand. It's a promise.」%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「... It's a promise.」%K%P

0x6AC
A smile rises on Haruka's lips at those words. Satisfied,%Nshe leaves the room.%K%P

0x6B8
4:30, huh... I set my watch alarm to that time before I%Ncollapse on the bed...%K%P

0x738
My watch alarm... When I hear that sound, I immediately%Nwake up. And, at the same time...%K%P

0x760
... I hear the sound of knocking on the door.%K%P

0x794
Haruka「... Are you awake?」%K%P

0x7A0
She slowly asks this in a quiet voice.%K%P

0x7AC
Makoto「Ah... I'm awake! Wait a minute!」%K%P

0x7B8
Haruka「... Okay.」%K%P

0x7C4
I quickly get off the bed and head out to the living room,%Nwhere Haruka is waiting...%K%P

0x820
I let out a sigh in the quiet, empty room.%K%N

0x82C
I can hear Okuhiko snoring from up in the loft.%K%P

0x838
Makoto「Well then, shall we go?」%K%P

0x844
I ask this with a nod, and Haruka follows suit.%K%P

0x858
I start to reach out for the doorknob on the front door.%K%N

0x874
And, at that moment...%K%P

0x880
Okuhiko「Hey! Wait!」%K%P

0x88C
... Okuhiko suddenly shouts in a roaring voice.%K%N

0x898
When I look up in surprise...%K%P

0x914
Okuhiko「This is bad... I... don't have... enough... energy...... Zzz...」%K%P

0x928
Okuhiko「Neutrino Energy, Power On! ... Trans〜form! ... There! ...%NZzz...」%K%P

0x93C
Okuhiko「You've shown yourself, Mysterious Hi-Tech Vacuum%NCleaner Man... Ugh... He's... sucking... me in... ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x950
Okuhiko「Good work... Zzz...」%K%P

0x964
Okuhiko「Hey! ... Kid! ... Get off of the stage! ... Hey, stop it! ... Don't...%Nlower... that zipper! ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x978
... It seems he's just sleeptalking.%K%P

0x984
(Whew... man, what kind of dream is he having anyway...?)%K%P

0x990
I ignore Okuhiko and open the front door...%K%P

0xA04
Haruka and I begin to walk side-by-side down the hill%Nroad that leads to the shoreline.%K%N

0xA10
On the way, Haruka suddenly mutters this.%K%P

0xA24
Haruka「They're so pretty...」%K%P

0xA30
Haruka stares at the night sky as a smile graces her lips.%K%P

0xA68
I also look up at the sky.%K%P

0xA74
It's completely covered in stars.%K%N

0xA80
They shine brightly, their light raining down onto the%Nearth.%K%P

0xA9C
My eyes turn to Haruka.%K%P

0xAA8
There's a cool and clear beauty to her face as she%Nlooks up at the stars.%K%N

0xAB4
It looks as if all the filthy things the world has burdened%Nher with are starting to be dispelled by the light of the%Nstars...%K%P

0xAC0
That's when it hits me.%K —What does Haruka mean to%Nme...?%K%P

0xACC
My heart clutches at the thought.%K%PThe memories of the time I've spent with Haruka here over%Nthe past few days rush through my mind.%K%P

0xAD8
At first, I felt like she was just a little girl, unable to get a%Ngrip on the world.%K%P

0xAE4
That's right... I sometimes felt as if I were her father.%K%N

0xAF0
No, even now, I still have those protective feelings%Ntowards her.%K%P

0xAFC
But is that truly it?%K%N

0xB08
Is that really all it is...?%K%P

0xB40
When Haruka and I reach the shoreline, the stars twinkle%Nwith a beautiful intensity, as if they've reached the time%Non this night where they shine their brightest.%K%P

0xB54
As Haruka faces the sea, she looks up towards the%Nstarlit sky as if she's yearning to become part of it.%K%N

0xB60
Her face seems anxious, and it feels like she's trying to%Nforce herself to smile.%K%P

0xB6C
It's like I'm seeing the bottom of Haruka's heart.%K%P

0xB78
I start to feel a little guilty, so I shift my gaze towards the%Nocean.%K%N

0xB84
At that moment...%K%P

0xB90
Countless lights with tinges of red and yellow rise above%Nthe water's surface.%K%N

0xB9C
They approach us before bobbing away, flickering.%K%P

0xBA8
They resemble giant fireflies hovering above the water,%Nswaying to and fro in straight lines.%K%P

0xBB4
Makoto「Th-this is...?」%K%P

0xBC0
Haruka「... Shiranui.」%K%P

0xBCC
Haruka「They move as if they're guiding sailors on ships. No one%Nknows where they came from or why they sway the way%Nthey do. That's why they're called shiranui, or 'unknown%Nfire'...」%K%P

0xBD8
Makoto「Wow...」%K%P

0xBE4
Makoto「But if I remember correctly... aren't shiranui lights from the%Nshore that refract abnormally due to cold air around the%Nwater's surface? That's why they appear to shapeshift,%Nright?」%K%P

0xBF0
Haruka「That's wrong...」%K%P

0xBFC
Makoto「'Wrong'...? But surely you must have known that. You're%Nway smarter than me, after a-」%K%P

0xC08
Haruka「That's wrong...!」%K%P

0xC14
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xC20
Haruka「It has nothing to do with being smart.」%K%P

0xC2C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC38
Haruka「That's wrong.」%K%P

0xC44
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC50
Haruka「No one knows why they light up.」%K%P

0xC5C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC68
Haruka「Nobody knows that.」%K%P

0xC74
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC80
Haruka「It'll always remain a mystery...」%K%P

0xC8C
Makoto「That's why... it's shiranui?」%K%P

0xC98
Haruka「Yes... That's why it's shiranui...」%K%P

0xCA4
Cool and clear...%K%N

0xCB0
Haruka really does give off that kind of feeling.%K%P

0xCBC
She has something that normal people don't.%K%N

0xCC8
I don't know whether or not it's related to her being a%Nclone, but I believe that.%K%P

0xCD4
(It's like Haruka came from a faraway parallel universe...)%K%P
