I still haven't confessed to Izumi-san. I still haven't told%Nher my feelings.%K%P

0x15C
The clear morning light shines in.%K%P

0x168
I sit up in my bed, and check the date on my watch.%K%P

0x184
(3 WED 10:00 A.M.)%K%P

0x190
That's right... today is April 3rd.%K%P

0x19C
Actually, it's April 8th, but to us, today must be April 3rd.%K%P

0x1A8
In order to keep up our act to deceive Okuhiko, we have%Nto act as we did on that day.%K%P

0x1B4
I enter the living room.%K%P

0x22C
Yuka's there.%K%P

0x238
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x244
Yuka「Oh, Makoto. Good morning.」%K%P

0x258
I check the old VCR's digital display.%K%P

0x264
The date there says April 3rd.%K%P

0x270
When we got back to the lodge yesterday, we changed%Nall of the dates in the lodge so that they read April 3rd.%K%N

0x27C
Of course, we didn't forget about Okuhiko's watch.%K%P

0x288
As I take my breakfast, I survey the whole room to check%Neverything over again.%K%P

0x294
Everything's okay. We haven't overlooked anything.%K%P

0x2A0
We need to be careful to make sure that Okuhiko doesn't%Nwatch TV or talk to any of the locals.%K%P

0x2AC
... Well, judging from what I saw of his state yesterday,%Nthere's probably no need to worry.%K%P

0x2B8
Unless he somehow manages to figure everything out,%Nhe should move just as predicted.%K%P

0x2C4
Rather, I think that Okuhiko will take the same actions he%Ndid in the past to reproduce history as accurately as%Npossible so that something unexpected doesn't occur.%K%P

0x2D0
Sometimes, even I don't know which one is doing the%Ndeceiving anymore.%K%P

0x2DC
But all's well.%K Today's plan should go off without a hitch.%K%P

0x2EC
... Before long, I hear Okuhiko's footsteps and voice.%K%P

0x2F8
Okuhiko「Promise? What promise?」%K%P

0x30C
Haruka「... I'm going fishing today.」%K%P

0x328
Haruka comes rushing into the living room, with Okuhiko%Nhot on her heels.%K%P

0x33C
Okuhiko「Huh? Haruka-chan, what do you mean by that? Isn't%Ntoday the day we go to the pool?」%K%P

0x348
Makoto「What are you saying, Okuhiko? We went to the pool%Nyesterday, right?」%K%P

0x354
Okuhiko「... Huh?」%K%P

0x370
Yuka「Okuhiko-kun... are you all right? You were acting strange%Nthe day before yesterday as well...」%K%P

0x384
Okuhiko「But... today's... W... WHAAAAAAAT!!!?」%K%P

0x390
Okuhiko is taken aback when he looks at his watch, his%Nface contorted with shock.%K%P

0x39C
Okuhiko「T... T-T-Then, today's April 3rd...」%K%P

0x3B0
Yuka「Today, we're scheduled to play tennis♪」%K%P

0x3BC
Yuka answers shamelessly.%K%P

0x3C8
But.. our future has now been entrusted to Okuhiko, and%Neverything depends on his responses.%K%P

0x3DC
Okuhiko「Th... That's right... Wh-What the hell am I saying...」%K%P

0x3F0
Okuhiko「Right... today's the day we play tennis and have the%NTest of Courage, isn't it...?」%K%P

0x404
Yuka「Huh? Test of Courage? Haruka, is this true?」%K%P

0x420
Haruka「... I don't know about it.」%K%P

0x42C
Makoto「What's wrong, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x440
Okuhiko「Uh... u-uh... umm... What... indeed? ... I wonder why I thought%Nthat?」%K%P

0x44C
Okuhiko「For some reason, I felt like we were having a Test of%NCourage today.」%K%P

0x460
Okuhiko「Ha ha ha... I wonder if your premonition powers are%Ncontagious, Ishihara?」%K%P

0x46C
Heh heh heh... He's desperately trying to play dumb.%K%P

0x478
But he messed up. This was obviously an error on his%Npart.%K%P

0x48C
Okuhiko「Huh? Now that I think about it, where's Kurumi-chan? I%Ndon't see her anywhere.」%K%P

0x498
Crap! He finally noticed...%K%P

0x4B4
Yuka「Ah... umm... err...」%K%P

0x4D0
Haruka「Kurumi went home... yesterday... She hadn't finished her%Nspring break homework yet...」%K%P

0x4DC
Haruka instantly backs up Yuka.%K%N

0x4E8
But...%K%P

0x4FC
Okuhiko「Huh? Really?」%K%P

0x518
Yuka「Yeah, yeah! That's right. Did you forget, Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0x534
This is bad... He probably thought it was already strange%Nenough that he had no memory, but...%K%P

0x540
We should have told him this yesterday.%K%P

0x54C
Okuhiko is clearly starting to get suspicious!%K%P

0x560
Okuhiko「Could it be... that you're all deceiving me?」%K%P

0x574
—Shit!!%K%N

0x580
H-Have we been found out!?%K%P

0x5B0
Okuhiko「... Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x5BC
... He really is a naive guy...%K%P

0x5D0
Okuhiko「Ah... but you said you were going fishing, Haruka-chan.」%K%P

0x5EC
Yuka「Hold on. We're scheduled to play tennis today.」%K%P

0x600
Haruka「Huh? ... Tennis?」%K%P

0x614
Yuka「Haruka, you can't just say '%CFF8FI%CFFFF'll pass' today. That'd be%Ngoing against the group leader's orders.」%K%P

0x628
Haruka looks at me with a troubled expression.%K%P

0x634
It feels like I'm watching a recording of that incident from%Nthe real 3rd.%K%P

0x650
Okuhiko「That's right, Haruka-chan. As planned, we're playing%Ntennis. Fishing is just for old geezers anyway.」%K%P

0x65C
Haruka「I made a promise...」%K%P

0x670
... Everything after that happens the same way as last%Ntime.%K%P

0x67C
Okuhiko is even more resilient in his efforts to keep us%Nfrom going than before, but before long, Saki appears%Nwith a basket, and practically drags him away to go play%Ntennis with her.%K%P

0x688
Then, Haruka and I leave to go fishing as planned.%K%P

0x69C
Okuhiko「... S-Sounds good. Fishing is just for old geezers%Nanyway, I don't want to do that.」%K%P

0x6B0
Saki「Huh, fishing?」%K%P

0x6C4
Okuhiko「Ah, it's nothing. I'm impressed, Saki-chan. You knew I liked%Ntennis?」%K%P

0x6D0
Okuhiko, spiteful as always, can only think of saying the%Nsame lines he used last time.%K%P

0x6DC
I wolfishly grin.%K%N

0x6E8
He's not as smooth as he thinks he is... Is that the best%Nhe's got...?%K%P

0x76C
By the time we finish fishing, half a day has already%Npassed.%K%P

0x778
The sky is dyed a beautiful mad red.%K%P

0x784
Makoto「Aaaaah... I didn't catch anything〜」%K%P

0x798
Haruka「... Doesn't seem like it.」%K%P

0x7A4
—Whoa!%K%P

0x7B0
She spoke so suddenly that it surprised me.%K%N

0x7BC
She probably didn't mean anything bad by it, though...%K%P

0x7C8
Like last time, I caught nothing.%K%N

0x7D4
On the other hand, Haruka got a bite almost every time%Nshe cast, and caught quite a lot of big catches.%K%P

0x7E0
(Of course, she let all of them go after reeling them in...)%K%P

0x7EC
Anyway, just why is there such a big difference%Nbetween us?%K%P

0x7F8
Do I just suck that much? Or does Haruka have excellent%Nsenses?%K%P

0x804
Makoto「Mmm...」%K%P

0x810
I can't help but groan...%K%P

0x82C
Just then...%K%P

0x838
Haruka「Hey, Makoto?」%K%P

0x844
... Haruka suddenly calls out to me.%K%P

0x850
However, her eyes remain fixed on the tip of the pole.%K%P

0x85C
Makoto「Yeah?」%K%P

0x868
Haruka「... There's something I want to ask you.」%K%P

0x874
Makoto「Me?」%K%P

0x880
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x88C
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x898
Haruka「Umm...」%K%P

0x8B4
For some reason, Haruka goes silent after she says%Nthat.%K%P

0x8DC
The only sound I can hear is the crashing of the waves%Nagainst the pier.%K%P

0x8E8
Several silent seconds later, Haruka finally speaks in a%Nsoft voice.%K%P

0x8F4
Haruka「Makoto... have you ever kissed someone before?」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「Wh-What!?」%K%P

0x914
Haruka「... Will you kiss me?」%K%P

0x920
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x934
Haruka「Let's kiss.」%K%P

0x950
Haruka draws her face close to mine. Her expression%Nbegins to overwhelm my senses.%K%P

0x978
My heart feels like it's bursting out of my chest.%K%P

0x984
This event... it's happened before somewhere...%K%N

0x990
... Wait, this is exactly what happened on the 3rd after we%Nfinished fishing, isn't it!?%K%P

0x99C
Makoto「H-Hey, Haruka... Y-You... don't have to do this...」%K%P

0x9A8
Makoto「It's not like Okuhiko... is watching us...」%K%P

0x9B4
Haruka「... That... has nothing to do with it.」%K%P

0x9C0
This is starting to make me feel alarmingly uncomfortable.%K%P

0x9CC
I try to open my mouth and speak, but no words come%Nout...%K%P

0x9D8
Haruka「Makoto... I want you to kiss me.」%K%P

0xA08
Haruka「... You don't want to?」%K%P

0xA14
Haruka's eyes seem to be cloudy with tears.%K%P

0xA20
I-Impossible... She's never acted this way before up until%Nnow...%K%P

0xA2C
This is all incomprehensible to me.%K%P

0xA38
I had no idea.%K I had no idea that Haruka saw me this way...%K%P

0xA44
... But I'm a man. I can manage a little kiss!%K%P

0xA50
Makoto「On the... forehead?」%K%P

0xA5C
I somehow manage to speak.%K%P

0xA68
All right! I've got to keep it together.%K%P

0xA84
But... Haruka...%K shakes her head, denying my words.%K%P

0xA90
H-Hey... you don't mean...%K%P

0xA9C
Haruka「I want you to kiss me... on the lips...」%K%P

0xAA8
... ... ... ... I'm at a loss for words.%K%P

0xAB4
Haruka「I want you to teach me... how to do a real kiss.」%K%P

0xAC0
I shamelessly gawk at her...%K%P

0xACC
My heart's pounding. I can't breathe.%K%P

0xAD8
... No way.%K%P

0xAE4
She's serious about this. She's completely serious%Nabout kissing me!!%K%P

0xAF0
I feel dizzy from the lack of air.%K%P

0xAFC
Haruka「I want you to teach me... Makoto.」%K%P

0xB2C
Haruka quietly brings her face close to mine.%K%P

0xB38
... Stop... stop...%K%P

0xB44
I have... Izumi-san. Izumi-san already told me... that she%Nloves me!!%K%P

0xB50
B-But... Right now, I could die from a lack of oxygen.%K%P

0xB5C
... I-I definitely... learned about this in class.%K%P

0xB68
When your own life is in danger, then it's not a crime to%Nkiss someone else to save your life...%K%P

0xB74
That's right! This is just self-preservation!!%K%P

0xB80
My heart beats faster and faster from the lack of%Noxygen.%K%P

0xB8C
Haruka's lips are right in front of me.%K%N

0xB98
Haruka's sweet lips are right in front of me.%K%N

0xBA4
Haruka's pink lips are right in front of me.%K%P

0xBB0
Izumi-san's face and Haruka's face overlap.%K%P

0xBBC
I... I...%K

0x1658
Perform the self-preservation technique.

0x1664
I can't betray Izumi-san.

0xC30
I gradually... blank out.%K%P

0xC3C
Haruka... Haruka...%K%N

0xC48
Before long... my shadow becomes one with Haruka's%Nshadow...%K%P

0xC64
...%K%N

0xC70
Did I... do... it?%K%P

0xC84
(... Izumi-san!!)%K%P

0xC90
I tighten my hands into fists, and speak up.%K%P

0xC9C
Makoto「I'm very sorry... but I... can't.」%K%P

0xCB0
Haruka's eyes begin to well up with sadness.%K%P

0xCBC
Makoto「Umm... it's not like... I hate you or anything, Haruka.」%K%P

0xCC8
Makoto「It's just... well... I don't think we have that kind of%Nrelationship...」%K%P

0xCD4
I'm talking frantically. It's as if I'm desperately making an%Nexcuse to justify myself.%K%P

0xCE0
Yeah, that's probably it... my heart's throbbing so much%Nbecause I feel guilty.%K%P

0xD0C
Haruka「I see...」%K%P

0xD18
Haruka mutters this regretfully.%K%P

0xD24
Makoto「I'm sorry...」%K%P

0xD30
I apologize again.%K%N

0xD3C
There must be someone more appropriate out there for%NHaruka than me... At least, that's what I hope.%K%P

0xD48
Haruka「Makoto... do you like sea roaches?」%K%P

0xD78
Haruka「I... like them.」%K%P

0xD84
Haruka returns to her normal self as if nothing ever%Nhappened.%K%P

0xD90
No, it's more like she's forcing herself to...%K%N

0xD9C
It's very painful being with Haruka right now.%K%P

0xDA8
Haruka「Then... I have a different favor.」%K%P

0xDB4
Makoto「What is it?」%K%P

0xDD0
... Haruka's favor:%K%N

0xDDC
"Catch a lot of sea roaches and place them in a plastic%Nbag."%K%P

0xDE8
I feel like I'm going to faint just hearing that.%K%P

0xE30
I don't remember what happened after that.%K%N

0xE3C
Before I know it, I'm in my room in the lodge.%K%P

0xE48
Did my consciousness fly out of my body to protect it%Nfrom the shock I felt back then?%K%N

0xE54
Who knows...%K%P

0xE60
... Another strange thing happened too. ... Haruka's%Ncompletely back to normal.%K%P

0xE6C
She's acting as if what happened earlier never%Noccurred.%K%P

0xEB4
... I wonder how long it's been since then.%K%P

0xEC0
I throw myself onto the bed. Haruka's face faintly forms%Non the ceiling.%K%P

0xECC
What do I think of Haruka?%K%P

0xED8
Up until now, I assumed that I thought of her as%Nsomething like a daughter.%K%P

0xEE4
(But... what about now? What do I think about her now?)%K%P

0xF00
I kissed... her...%K%N

0xF0C
And it was on the lips this time, too... No, I'm not sure if I%Nactually kissed her there or not.%K%P

0xF18
All this thinking about kissing reminds me of the%Nsensation of Haruka's lips...%K%P

0xF24
Haah...%K%N

0xF30
Yeah... I definitely kissed her there...%K%P

0xF44
I managed to stop myself from kissing her.%K%P

0xF50
I didn't betray Izumi-san.%K%P

0xF5C
... Didn't betray her? Is that really true? I remember my%Nthrobbing heartbeat from back then. It wasn't a fluke%Nthat I felt that.%K%P

0xF68
In other words, it means that a part of me wanted to kiss%NHaruka...%K%P

0xF74
In some corner of my mind, I've thought about kissing%Nher...%K%P

0xF80
Haah... I really am... a mentally unfaithful bastard.%K%P

0xF8C
I begin to hate myself.%K%P

0xF98
... Hold on. Just wait a minute.%K%P

0xFA4
I still haven't confessed to Izumi-san. I still haven't told%Nher my feelings.%K%P

0xFB0
Even so, why am I worrying about this? Normally, wouldn't I%Nonly be worried if I had confessed to her?%K%P

0xFBC
This situation is steadily heading in a direction I don't%Nwant it to go at all...%K%P

0xFC8
Why... Why is this happening?%K%P

0xFD4
(Anyway, I need to tell Izumi-san my feelings as quickly%Nas possible!)%K%P

0xFE0
I fortify my newfound determination.%K%P

0xFFC
—At that moment, I hear Okuhiko's voice.%K%P

0x1008
(I see, it's that time already...)%K%P

0x1014
I shake off my thoughts, and rush out of my room.%K%P

0x1064
... ... ...%K%P

0x10C0
For a while, the two of us continue to fish silently.%K%P

0x10CC
As I focus on the tip of my fishing rod, I absently think%Nabout Haruka, who is sitting next to me.%K%P

0x10D8
(What do I think of Haruka?)%K%P

0x10E4
Up until now, I thought that I thought of her as something%Nlike a daughter.%K%P

0x10F0
(But... what about now? What do I think about her now?)%K%P

0x1114
Yesterday... I kissed... her...%K%P

0x1120
And it was on the lips this time too... No, I'm not sure if I%Nactually kissed her there.%K%P

0x112C
But it feels like my lips came in contact with Haruka's...%K%P

0x1138
Haah...%K%N

0x1144
Yeah... I definitely kissed her there...%K%P

0x1158
Yesterday, I managed to stop myself from kissing her.%K%P

0x1164
I didn't betray Izumi-san.%K%P

0x1170
... Didn't betray her? Is that really true? I remember my%Nthrobbing heartbeat from back then. It wasn't a fluke%Nthat I felt that.%K%P

0x117C
Some part of me wanted to kiss Haruka...%K%P

0x1188
In some corner of my mind, I've thought about kissing%Nher...%K%P

0x1194
Haah... I really am... a mentally unfaithful bastard.%K%P

0x11A0
I begin to hate myself.%K%P

0x11AC
... Hold on. Just wait a minute.%K%P

0x11B8
I still haven't confessed to Izumi-san. I still haven't told%Nher my feelings.%K%P

0x11C4
Even so, why am I worrying about this? Normally, wouldn't I%Nonly be worried if I had confessed to her?%K%P

0x11D0
The situation is steadily advancing in the opposite%Ndirection I want it to go...%K%P

0x11DC
Why... Why is this happening?%K%P

0x11E8
(Anyway, I need to tell Izumi-san my feelings as quickly%Nas possible!)%K%P

0x11F4
This time, it will happen.%K%P

0x1260
Before long, we finish fishing, and return to the lodge.%K%P

0x126C
I lie down on my bed while waiting for the next event to%Noccur.%K%P

0x1278
—And then, I hear Okuhiko's voice...%K%P

0x1284
I run out of my room faster than a hurricane.%K%P
