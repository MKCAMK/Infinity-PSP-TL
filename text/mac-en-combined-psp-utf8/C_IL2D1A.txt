As I wake up, I kick the covers off the bed with all my%Nstrength.%K%P

0xB0
Still half asleep, I blankly stare into space.%K%P

0xBC
It's a familiar... ceiling...%K%P

0xC8
I realize I'm freezing, my body soaked with sweat all over.%K%P

0xD4
I take a deep breath and slowly exhale.%K%P

0xE0
The warm scent of wood goes through my nose and fills%Nmy head.%K%P

0xEC
It takes me three more breaths until...%K%P

0xF8
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x104
Makoto「T-This is...」%K%P

0x110
Makoto「The lodge...」%K%P

0x11C
Makoto「... This is the lodge, isn't it!?」%K%P

0x154
I quickly jump out of the bed.%K%P

0x160
I stand in the center of the room, and look around.%K%P

0x16C
(There's no mistaking it...)%K%P

0x178
(This is my bedroom!)%K%P

0x184
What's going on?%K%P

0x190
Then... Then... the dream I had just now...%K%P

0x19C
—That's wrong!%K%N

0x1A8
—That's wrong! What the hell am I saying!?%K%P

0x1B4
—That wasn't a "dream"!!%K%N

0x1C0
—There's no way in hell that was a "dream"...%K%P

0x204
Suddenly, I hear a sound as violent as a gunshot!%K%P

0x21C
I turn around, and standing there, I see...%K%N

0x228
I see...%K%P

0x288
Yuka「Wh... What's going on!?」%K%P

0x294
Yuka「Why...!?」%K%P

0x2A0
This scene... it's definitely...%K%P

0x2AC
I quickly look at my watch.%K%P

0x2B8
"1 MON 9:19 A.M."%K%P

0x2C4
—1st.%K%P

0x2D0
—1st!?!?!?%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「That's... impossible...」%K%P

0x2E8
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x2F4
(What's the meaning of this?)%K%P

0x300
(What happened?)%K%P

0x30C
(Why am I here?)%K%P

0x318
I don't understand.%K%P

0x324
My mind is thrown into extreme confusion.%K%P

0x330
Makoto「S-Sorry, Yuka...」%K%P

0x33C
I brush past Yuka, and head for the living room.%K%P

0x37C
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x3A4
Okuhiko is already there.%K%P

0x3B0
He's lounging on the sofa, smoking...%K%P

0x3BC
... Smoking a cigarette?%K%P

0x3C8
Up until now, I've never seen Okuhiko in the middle of%Nsmoking before.%K%P

0x3D4
But none of that matters right now!%K%P

0x3E0
I briskly walk over to Okuhiko, suddenly grab him by the%Ncollar, and force him to get up to his feet.%K%P

0x3F4
Okuhiko「Wh-What the hell are you doing, Ishihara...」%K%P

0x400
Makoto「Shut up! Just shut your mouth and answer my question!」%K%P

0x40C
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x418
Makoto「What's today's date?」%K%P

0x424
Okuhiko「... Huh?」%K%P

0x430
Makoto「I'm asking you what today's date is!」%K%P

0x444
Okuhiko「I-Ishihara... Are you joking?」%K%P

0x474
Makoto「Answer the goddamn question!!」%K%P

0x494
Okuhiko「... It's... April... 1st.」%K%P

0x4A0
As I thought...%K%P

0x4AC
As I thought, that really was it...%K%P

0x4B8
But... why...?%K%P

0x4C4
Okuhiko「H-Hey, Ishihara... Cut it out and please let me go...」%K%P

0x4D0
Okuhiko's eyes are filled with fear.%K%P

0x4DC
I glare at them.%K%P

0x500
Okuhiko「Wh-What is it...」%K%P

0x50C
Okuhiko「What did I do wrong...?」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「What, you ask!?」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「Are you seriously telling me that you have no idea...!?」%K%P

0x538
Okuhiko「...?」%K%P

0x544
Makoto「Oh, I get it...」%K%P

0x550
Makoto「So that's it...」%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「You thought I hadn't learned from experience, so you're%Ntrying to deceive me again...」%K%P

0x568
Makoto「Isn't that right!? Huh!?」%K%P

0x574
Okuhiko「Wh-Wh-What are you talking about... I...」%K%P

0x5A4
Makoto「Don't play dumb!」%K%P

0x5C4
Okuhiko「I-I get it... I get it...」%K%P

0x5D8
Okuhiko「I'll talk, I'll talk...」%K%P

0x5E4
Okuhiko「But honestly... I haven't deceived you.」%K%P

0x5F0
Okuhiko「At the very least, I haven't deceived you yet...」%K%P

0x5FC
Makoto「... 'Yet'? What do you mean by 'yet'!?」%K%P

0x608
I tighten my grip on his collar.%K%P

0x62C
Okuhiko「A-As I was saying, it's a fact that I was planning to try to%Ndeceive you in the future, but...」%K%P

0x638
Okuhiko「... I still... haven't gotten around to executing it yet...」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「Quit being so vague!」%K%P

0x650
Makoto「I don't understand you at all!」%K%P

0x664
Okuhiko「I-I don't understand either.」%K%P

0x670
Okuhiko「In the first place, how did you know about it?」%K%P

0x67C
(D-Damn him...)%K%P

0x688
(He's planning on still playing dumb this late into the%Ngame...?)%K%P

0x694
My innards feel like they're boiling with rage... Well,%Nwhatever.%K%P

0x6A0
Talking to him is just a waste of time.%K%P

0x6AC
(More importantly, right now...)%K%P

0x6DC
I thrust Okuhiko away, and rush out the front door with%Nthe swiftness of a gale.%K%P

0x7B8
I've decided on my destination.%K%N

0x7C4
Obviously, it's Lunabeach.%K%P

0x7D0
First, I've got to confirm Izumi-san's safety.%K%P

0x830
Today is April 1st...%K%N

0x83C
... I'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that.%K%P

0x848
It's most likely that in reality, things went like this.%K%P

0x854
Back then... I managed to miraculously survive falling off%Nthat cliff.%K%P

0x860
My unconscious body was taken to the hospital and%Nwas afterwards brought back to the lodge somehow by%Nsomebody.%K%P

0x86C
After that, Okuhiko thought...%K%P

0x878
"When he regains consciousness, I'll pretend as if that%Nday were April 1st."%K%P

0x884
... and decided to trick me.%K%P

0x890
"Today is April 1st... Then I must have time traveled!"%K%P

0x89C
If I didn't have a stronger grasp on my mind, I probably%Nwould have thought that.%K%P

0x8A8
But I don't know his goal...%K%P

0x8B4
Is he just trying to play a prank on me? Or does he have%Nsome other intention?%K%P

0x8CC
Now that I think about it, on the 6th... Okuhiko said this.%K%P

0x914
Okuhiko「It's not like we were doing any of it to ridicule you,%NIshihara.」%K%P

0x920
Okuhiko「We were forced to do it for a logical goal.」%K%P

0x990
(A logical goal...?)%K%P

0x99C
Well, knowing Okuhiko, it's probably something stupid.%K%P

0x9A8
At any rate, Okuhiko had planned in some fashion to%Nattempt to make me firmly believe in the ridiculous notion%Nof time travel.%K%P

0x9B4
He must have carefully changed the date on my watch...%K%P

0x9C0
When I think of everything that's happened up until now, I%Nrealize that none of it is a mystery, no matter how%Ncomplex it may seem.%K%P

0x9CC
At least, that's the most logical explanation I've got so%Nfar.%K%P

0x9D8
However...%K%P

0xA38
... There's just one thing I still don't know.%K%P

0xA44
That's right! Izumi-san!%K%P

0xA50
Was Izumi-san saved, just like me?%K%P

0xA5C
(Please...)%K%P

0xA68
(—Be alive, Izumi-san!)%K%P

0xA90
I continue to run to Lunabeach while praying with all my%Nheart.%K%P

0xAE4
Suddenly...%K%N

0xAF0
From the opposite end of the road, I spot someone%Nrunning this way.%K%P

0xAFC
The person has nearly transparent white skin... and is%Nwearing a deep orange apron...%K%P

0xB08
Is that...!?%K%P

0xB14
Makoto「I-Izumi-san!」%K%P

0xB38
Izumi「Makoto-kun!!」%K%P

0xB4C
As her voice trembles, Izumi-san plunges into my chest.%K%P

0xB58
I hold her thin body firmly in my arms.%K%P

0xB80
I can feel Izumi-san's... warmth...%K%P

0xB8C
I can smell the scent... of her soft hair...%K%P

0xB98
Izumi-san buries her face in my chest as she quietly%Nsobs.%K%P

0xBA4
She embraces my body strongly, intensely, as if to%Nconfirm that I really exist right here, right now.%K%P

0xBB0
Izumi「Makoto-kun... Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xBBC
In between her sobs, she desperately tries to tell me%Nsomething.%K%P

0xBC8
I respond by returning her embrace tightly.%K%P

0xBD4
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xBE0
Izumi「I'm so glad...」%K%P

0xBEC
Izumi「I... I...」%K%P

0xBF8
Izumi「I'm so glad that you're...」%K%P

0xC04
Izumi-san's breaths permeate through my chest.%K%P

0xC10
Those breaths are warm...%K%P

0xC1C
They're the proof... that she's alive...%K%P

0xC28
Makoto「It's all right. It's all right, Izumi-san.」%K%P

0xC34
Makoto「There's no way that I'll die that easily...」%K%P

0xC40
Izumi「... I'm... so sorry...」%K%P

0xC4C
Izumi「... I'm so... sorry...」%K%P

0xC58
A gust of spring breeze blows by.%K%P

0xC64
The trees all sway in the breeze.%K%P

0xC70
I see cherry blossom petals fall from far away.%K%P

0xC7C
The wind blowing across the sea is dyed pink.%K%P

0xC88
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0xC94
Makoto「You don't have to apologize for anything...」%K%P

0xCA0
Izumi「But... But...」%K%P

0xCAC
Makoto「I'm just happy...」%K%P

0xCB8
Makoto「... That you're alive, Izumi-san...」%K%P

0xCC4
Makoto「That alone... makes me happy...」%K%P

0xCD0
Izumi-san continues to cry.%K%P

0xCDC
She continues to cry in my chest for a long, long time.%K%P

0xCE8
Until her crying finally ceases, I can only think about this%None thing.%K%P

0xCF4
Being by Izumi-san's side right now, in this very moment,%Nis my greatest... joy...%K%P

0xD4C
... ... ...%K%P

0xD70
By the time Izumi-san finally calms down, the sun is%Nalready in the southern sky.%K%P

0xD7C
Izumi-san and I look out at the shining, silvery sea while%Nhanging on to the guardrail.%K%P

0xD88
I don't know what to talk about first, or if it's okay to%Neven speak.%K%P

0xD94
I have way too many things that I need to ask her.%K%P

0xDA0
Makoto「Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xDD0
Izumi「... Hmm?」%K%P

0xDDC
Makoto「What... about the shop?」%K%P

0xDE8
For now, I decide to just start off with a safe, simple%Ntopic.%K%P

0xDF4
Izumi「Kurumi's watching it.」%K%P

0xE00
Makoto「I see... Kurumi is, huh...」%K%P

0xE0C
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0xE18
Makoto「But Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xE24
Makoto「Doesn't Kurumi... have school soon?」%K%P

0xE38
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xE44
Izumi-san keeps silent.%K%P

0xE50
She bites her lower lip and hangs her head down before%Nshaking it slowly.%K%P

0xE5C
Izumi「I don't know...」%K%P

0xE68
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xE74
Izumi「What happened back then...?」%K%P

0xE80
Izumi「What kind of situation have we been put in now...?」%K%P

0xE8C
Izumi「I don't know... any of it...」%K%P

0xE98
Makoto「???」%K%P

0xEAC
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xEB8
Izumi「You know what day... today is, right?」%K%P

0xEC4
Makoto「No... honestly, I don't.」%K%P

0xED0
Makoto「I still haven't watched TV or read a newspaper...」%K%P

0xEDC
Makoto「I don't know how long I've been unconscious for...」%K%P

0xEE8
Izumi「I see...」%K%P

0xEF4
Izumi-san quietly mutters this, and gently takes my left%Nwrist.%K%P

0xF08
Izumi「This watch... it shows the date, doesn't it?」%K%P

0xF14
Makoto「Y-Yeah... it does... but...」%K%P

0xF20
Izumi「What day is it?」%K%P

0xF2C
Makoto「No, wait. If you're talking about the date, Okuhiko...」%K%P

0xF40
Izumi「What about Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0xF4C
Makoto「Okuhiko's trying to deceive me again...」%K%P

0xF58
Izumi「Okuhiko changed the date on your watch?」%K%P

0xF64
Makoto「... Yeah.」%K%P

0xF70
Izumi「And what did Okuhiko-kun say?」%K%P

0xF7C
Makoto「He quickly admitted it...」%K%P

0xF88
Makoto「He said that he had planned to deceive me...」%K%P

0xF9C
Izumi「'Planned to deceive you'... He said that?」%K%P

0xFA8
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0xFB4
Izumi「Anything else?」%K%P

0xFC0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xFCC
Izumi「Did Okuhiko-kun say anything else?」%K%P

0xFD8
Izumi-san looks straight at me.%K%P

0xFE4
Her pupils look like they're filled with complex emotions.%K%P

0xFF0
Makoto「Izumi-san... just what do you want to say?」%K%P

0xFFC
Izumi「It's fine... I'll tell you about it later...」%K%P

0x1008
Izumi「So will you answer my question?」%K%P

0x1014
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1020
Izumi「What did Okuhiko-kun say?」%K%P

0x102C
Makoto「'It's a fact that I was planning to try to deceive you in%Nthe future... but...'」%K%P

0x1038
Makoto「'... I still... haven't gotten around to executing it yet...'」%K%P

0x1044
Makoto「I don't remember much of what he said after that...」%K%P

0x1050
Makoto「In the first place, what he said was completely nonsensi-」%K%P

0x1074
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x1080
Izumi「We might... have been caught up in something%Nunbelievable...」%K%P

0x108C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x1098
Izumi「If what Okuhiko-kun said is true, then...」%K%P

0x10A4
Izumi「Just who changed the date on your watch?」%K%P

0x10B0
Makoto「H-H-Hold on, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x10BC
Makoto「You're not saying that you believe what Okuhiko said,%Nare you?」%K%P

0x10C8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x10D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1104
Izumi「... Yes.」%K%P

0x1110
Makoto「!? W-Why do you trust that bastard!?」%K%P

0x1124
Izumi「You're wrong, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x1130
Izumi「The one I trust isn't Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0x113C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x1150
Izumi「It's Kurumi...」%K%P

0x115C
Makoto「... What?」%K%P

0x1168
Izumi「I trust Kurumi.」%K%P

0x1174
Izumi「Ever since she was born, I've known...」%K%P

0x1180
Izumi「That Kurumi was definitely not the kind of girl who would%Nlie!」%K%P

0x118C
Makoto「I'm sorry... I don't really understand what you're saying.」%K%P

0x1198
Izumi「In other words, what Kurumi said and what Okuhiko-kun%Nsaid is the same thing.」%K%P

0x11A4
Izumi「Since I trust Kurumi, I must trust what Okuhiko-kun said%Ntoo as a result.」%K%P

0x11B0
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x11C4
Izumi「You still don't understand?」%K%P

0x11D0
Makoto「No, I do, but...」%K%P

0x11DC
Makoto「... But what... did Kurumi say?」%K%P

0x11F0
Izumi-san thinks for a bit, trying to carefully choose her%Nwords, and then speaks.%K%P

0x11FC
Izumi「Today...」%K%P

0x1208
Izumi「... is April... 1st.」%K%P

0x121C
Izumi「'Today's the 1st, duh!'... That's what she said.」%K%P

0x1238
I can't speak. The words won't come out of me.%K%P

0x1244
It feels like something is blocking my throat, to the point%Nwhere I can't even breathe.%K%P

0x1250
Izumi「I reached this conclusion from your story...」%K%P

0x125C
Izumi「And from the fact Okuhiko-kun and Kurumi said the same%Nthing...」%K%P

0x1268
Izumi「And... the date on your watch is...」%K%P

0x1274
Izumi-san says this, and lifts up my wrist.%K%P

0x1280
The letters on the watch between Izumi-san and I are%Nclearly visible.%K%P

0x128C
"1.. MON..."%K%P

0x1298
Makoto「—Just cut it out already!」%K%P

0x12A4
I forcefully shake off Izumi-san's hand.%K%P

0x12B0
Makoto「What's gotten into you, Izumi-san...?」%K%P

0x12BC
Makoto「Saying today is the 1st... When you think about it calmly,%Nthere's no way that it's possible, is it!?」%K%P

0x12D0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x12DC
Makoto「How can you believe something that crazy just because%NKurumi said that?!」%K%P

0x12E8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x12F4
Makoto「Or could it be that...」%K%P

0x1300
Suspicions instantly flare up in my mind.%K%P

0x130C
Makoto「... No, it's nothing.」%K%P

0x1318
I quickly deny these thoughts.%K%P

0x1324
She's not still trying to deceive me... right?%K%P

0x1330
Izumi「Anyway, I think it'd be best if we talked and sorted things%Nout.」%K%P

0x133C
Izumi「Right now, just as you said... everything that I've brought%Nto light has been based off of just one objective fact.」%K%P

0x1348
Izumi「It's very dangerous to make judgments based off of%Nspeculations and hopes...」%K%P

0x1354
Makoto「Yeah. I also have a load of questions for you...」%K%P

0x1368
Izumi「Yes... of course... right...」%K%P

0x1374
Izumi「There's certainly a lot of things we need to talk about.」%K%P

0x1380
Izumi「Then... what should we talk about first...?」%K%P

0x13B0
Just then...%K%P

0x13BC
I hear footsteps running from the east towards our%Ndirection.%K%P

0x13D0
Izumi-san gasps, and turns around.%K%P

0x13DC
Izumi「Kurumi...!?」%K%P

0x13E8
(Huh? Kurumi?)%K%P

0x13FC
Immediately after I think this, Izumi-san leaps over the%Nguardrail and hides on the ground below it.%K%P

0x1408
Izumi「Hurry! Hide!」%K%P

0x1414
When I see her desperate expression, I automatically%Njump down next to Izumi-san.%K%P

0x144C
Makoto「But wh-」%K%P

0x1458
Izumi「Shh!」%K%P

0x1464
Izumi-san places her index finger over my lips.%K%P

0x1470
Before long...%K%P

0x1498
We hear Kurumi passing by us overhead, running as fast%Nas she can.%K%P

0x14A4
Hanging from her left hand is a square, silver bag.%K%P

0x14B0
(Is that a pizza...?)%K%P

0x14D8
The sound of her footsteps gets fainter and fainter...%K%P

0x14F0
Once we can't hear that sound any more...%K%P

0x1538
... Izumi-san and I go back up.%K%P

0x154C
Izumi「I'm sorry, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x1558
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1564
Izumi「I have to go back to the shop.」%K%P

0x1570
Makoto「W-Wait a minute!」%K%P

0x157C
Makoto「I haven't asked you anything yet!」%K%P

0x1588
Izumi「We'll... talk about it later.」%K%P

0x1594
Makoto「Then I'll also go to Lunabeach!」%K%P

0x15A8
Izumi「You can't.」%K%P

0x15B4
Makoto「What!? Why not!?」%K%P

0x15C0
Izumi「Just do it!」%K%P

0x15CC
Izumi「Anyway, act normal... it'll be fine if you act the same way%Nyou did on the last April 1st.」%K%P

0x15D8
Makoto「Wh-What the hell!? Why do I have to-」%K%P

0x15EC
Izumi「Enough!」%K%P

0x1600
Izumi「Just quiet down and do what I said just now.」%K%P

0x1614
Izumi「Please... okay?」%K%P

0x1644
Izumi-san gives me one last kind smile, and runs off.%K%P

0x1650
Left behind, I stand stock-still and dumbfounded in the%Nmiddle of the road as I watch Izumi-san slowly%Ndisappear...%K%P

0x1694
... ... ...%K%P

0x1720
For now, I decide to head back to the lodge.%K%P

0x172C
Before I hear Izumi-san's story, there's something vital%Nthat I must confirm.%K%P

0x1738
—Is today really April 1st?%K%P

0x1744
—Or is Okuhiko tricking me again?%K%P

0x1750
No! Why I am even thinking about this!?%K%P

0x175C
It's obvious that he's trying to trick me, isn't it!?%K%P

0x1768
If he isn't, then... there's no other explanation for this.%K%P

0x1774
I'm going to go prove it right now.%K%P

0x1780
This time, I will get the truth out of Okuhiko's own mouth.%K%P

0x178C
With firm determination welling up in my chest, I begin%Nwalking back to the lodge...%K%P

0x17C4
I think over everything while walking up the hill road%Nsurrounded by trees.%K%P

0x180C
Izumi「It'll be fine if you act the same way you did on the last%NApril 1st.」%K%P

0x186C
Just what was Izumi-san thinking when she said that?%K%P

0x1878
Does she really believe that today is April 1st...?%K%P

0x1884
Just because Kurumi said it? Is that really enough for%Nher?%K%P

0x1890
I can't understand that logic.%K%P

0x189C
(In that case... then is it actually that...)%K%P

0x18A8
(... Izumi-san is also deceiving me...?)%K%P

0x18B4
I don't want to think about it, but...%K%P

0x18C0
No matter how hard I try, I can't help considering the%Npossibility.%K%P

0x18CC
Because it's a fact that in the past, Izumi-san deceived%Nme...%K%P

0x18D8
It's a fact that she lied to me, along with Okuhiko...%K%P

0x18E4
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0x18F0
Unintentionally, I let out a deep sigh.%K%P

0x18FC
I have no pity for the me who can't trust Izumi-san...%K%P

0x1908
But at the same time, I can't help but be stubborn and%Nremain wary, telling myself that "I won't let myself be%Ndeceived again!"%K%P

0x1914
"Bitten once, shy twice", huh...?%K%P

0x195C
When I get exactly halfway up the hill, I see that same girl%Nfrom earlier cheerfully running down.%K%P

0x1968
It's Kurumi.%K%P

0x1974
Makoto「Hey! Kurumi!」%K%P

0x1980
I call out to her from far away.%K%P

0x198C
Kurumi temporarily stops, gives me a small bow, then%Nstarts running past me.%K%P

0x19B4
Makoto「Kurumi, what's wrong?」%K%P

0x19CC
Makoto「Did you have some business at the lodge?」%K%P

0x19E0
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x19EC
Kurumi is silent.%K%P

0x19F8
She looks taken aback, her jaw dropped...%K%P

0x1A14
Makoto「... Hmm?」%K%P

0x1A20
Makoto「What is it? Why are you staring at me like that?」%K%P

0x1A34
Kurumi「Ah... sorry.」%K%P

0x1A40
Kurumi「Umm... beg your pardon, but...」%K%P

0x1A4C
Kurumi「Whom... might you be?」%K%P

0x1A58
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x1A6C
Kurumi「O-Oh... please don't worry about it too much.」%K%P

0x1A78
Kurumi「Kurumi's got a bad memory...」%K%P

0x1A84
Kurumi「She's always forgetting people's names...」%K%P

0x1A90
Makoto「... Are you joking?」%K%P

0x1AA4
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x1AB0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1ABC
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x1AC8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1ADC
Kurumi「Sorry!」%K%P

0x1AE8
Kurumi「At the very least, if you just said your initials, Kurumi%Nmight remember!」%K%P

0x1AF4
The instant I hear that, all blood is drained out of my%Nhead.%K%P

0x1B00
I feel light headed.%K%P

0x1B28
(What is this...)%K%P

0x1B34
(This is terrible...)%K%P

0x1B40
(To think the situation would get so serious...)%K%P

0x1B4C
Makoto「That's... fine...」%K%P

0x1B58
I barely manage to mutter this.%K%P

0x1B6C
Kurumi「Ah, umm, umm...」%K%P

0x1B80
Kurumi「Kurumi's really sorry!」%K%P

0x1BB0
Kurumi gives me a deep bow, and runs away as if she's%Ntrying to escape from me...%K%P

0x1C1C
This confirms that what Izumi-san said earlier was right%Nto a certain degree.%K%P

0x1C28
Kurumi's behavior... It's clear that to her, today is April 1st.%K%P

0x1C34
Nevertheless, this is by no means indisputable proof%Nthat today is the 1st.%K%P

0x1C40
Right...%K%N

0x1C5C
There's also the possibility that even Kurumi is in%Ncahoots with Okuhiko.%K%P

0x1C68
Izumi-san said to trust Kurumi, but I don't know... if she%Nwas being honest.%K%P

0x1C74
—What's the truth?%K%N

0x1C80
—Which is reality?%K%P

0x1C8C
There's three possibilities.%K%P

0x1C98
#1: Okuhiko and Kurumi are lying to Izumi-san and me.%K%P

0x1CA4
#2: Okuhiko, Kurumi, and Izumi-san are all lying to me.%K%P

0x1CB0
#3: No one is lying.%K%P

0x1CBC
Anyway, standing around here and thinking won't get%Nanything solved.%K%P

0x1CC8
If I question Okuhiko, then I'll probably be able to see the%Ntruth.%K%P

0x1CD4
I run up the short staircase that leads to the lodge as%Nfast as I can.%K%P

0x1D38
I violently throw open the door.%K%P

0x1D50
Makoto「Hey! Where are you, Okuhiko!?」%K%P

0x1D64
Yuka「H-Hey... don't shout.」%K%P

0x1D70
Yuka「If you're looking for Okuhiko-kun, he's right in front of you.」%K%P

0x1D94
As she says, Okuhiko is sitting on the sofa.%K%P

0x1DA0
His eyes widen, and his cheeks tremble as he looks at%Nme...%K%P

0x1DB4
Okuhiko「Hey... what is it...?」%K%P

0x1DC0
Okuhiko「You planning on resorting to violence again...?」%K%P

0x1DCC
Makoto「That depends on your answers.」%K%P

0x1DD8
As I say this, I walk briskly towards Okuhiko.%K%P

0x1DEC
Okuhiko「Hey, someone do something about this barbarian!」%K%P

0x1E1C
And, at that time...%K%P

0x1E44
The cuckoo clock goes off.%K%P

0x1E50
At the same time, I hear the polite voice of the%Nannouncer from the TV.%K%P

0x1E5C
Announcer「Today is Monday, April 1st. This is the afternoon news.」%K%P

0x1E68
Her voice instantly reaches my ears.%K%P

0x1E80
"Monday, April 1st."%K%P

0x1E8C
It repeats once more in my head.%K%P

0x1E98
I stagger over to the TV, as if following a siren's call.%K%P

0x1EA4
I look at the old, round cathode ray tube.%K%P

0x1EB0
In it, I see the prim and proper announcer sitting down.%K%P

0x1ECC
On the upper left corner of the screen, in white font is%Nthe words "Monday, April 1st."%K%P

0x1ED8
Makoto「... Y-You're kidding, right...?」%K%P

0x1EE4
I unintentionally mutter this aloud.%K%P

0x1EF0
My gaze shifts towards the bottom of the TV.%K%P

0x1EFC
There's a square box filled with magazines. Apart from%Nthat, there's nothing.%K%P

0x1F08
In short, there's no recording devices to be found, like a%NVCR or anything of the like.%K%P

0x1F14
Of course, there's no recording devices built into the TV,%Neither...%K%P

0x1F20
Next, I peek at the backside of the TV.%K%P

0x1F2C
There's nothing...%K%P

0x1F38
Not even a cable connected to an outdoor antenna or%Nanything like that.%K%P

0x1F44
There's only an old fashioned indoor antenna on the top%Nof the TV...%K%P

0x1F50
Once again, I look at the TV screen.%K%P

0x1F5C
It has changed to a new scene; a place similar to a wide%Nauditorium, with hundreds of young men wearing brand%Nnew formal suits, listening with boredom as some man%Ngives a speech to them.%K%P

0x1F68
(Then... in other words...)%K%P

0x1F74
(This is exactly... what is being broadcast now, at this%Nvery instant!?)%K%P

0x1F88
Yuka「H-Hey, Makoto?」%K%P

0x1F94
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1FA0
Yuka「What are you doing?」%K%P

0x1FAC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1FB8
Yuka「Is there something wrong... with the TV?」%K%P

0x1FC4
Makoto「Hey, Yuka?」%K%P

0x1FD8
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x1FE4
Makoto「What's today's date?」%K%P

0x1FF8
Yuka「Wh-Why are you asking me that?」%K%P

0x2004
Makoto「It's fine, just answer!」%K%P

0x2010
Yuka「... April... 1st... right?」%K%P

0x2024
Makoto「Haruka?」%K%P

0x2038
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2044
Makoto「What's today's date?」%K%P

0x2050
Haruka「April... 1st...」%K%P

0x2064
I say nothing, and rush out the front door...%K%P

0x2124
I jump down the lodge's short staircase...%K%P

0x2184
I descend the hill road surrounded by trees as fast as I%Ncan...%K%P

0x21E4
I run down the road along the coastline without looking%Naside, and head to the east...%K%P

0x2260
... I've finally arrived here.%K%P

0x226C
I figured that people were bound to be around here.%K%P

0x2278
As I thought, there are adults here to watch the cherry%Nblossoms fall, while their children that they brought%Nalong play at Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0x2294
Since I came all this way running nonstop, I'm out of%Nbreath.%K%P

0x22A0
But I don't have time to rest.%K%P

0x22AC
I want to confirm the truth as soon as possible.%K%P

0x22B8
While panting like a dog, I call out to a young woman.%K%P

0x22C4
Makoto「... Excuse me...」%K%P

0x22D0
Woman「...」%K%P

0x22DC
Makoto「What's...」%K%P

0x22E8
Makoto「... What's... today's date?」%K%P

0x22F4
She glances at me, then walks away as if nothing%Nhappened.%K%P

0x2300
Makoto「Wait... a minute!」%K%P

0x230C
While saying this, I grab her tightly by the arm.%K%P

0x2318
Woman「P-Please stop! Let me go!」%K%P

0x2324
Makoto「What's... today's date...」%K%P

0x2330
Woman「Do you want me to call the cops!?」%K%P

0x233C
Makoto「If you tell me... then I'll... let go...」%K%P

0x2348
Woman「It's the 1st! April 1st!」%K%P

0x2354
Woman「Just let me go already!」%K%P

0x2360
The girl shakes off my grip before frantically running%Naway.%K%P

0x236C
I turn around, and see several sightseers giving me%Nsuspicious glances.%K%P

0x2378
I need to speak to more people...%K%N

0x2384
I approach a father who is holding his young son's hand.%K%P

0x2390
Makoto「Excuse me...」%K%P

0x239C
Makoto「... What's... today's date?」%K%P

0x23A8
Father「April... April 1st, I believe?」%K%P

0x23B4
Behind the father is his young son...%K%P

0x23C0
He's tightly clinging to his father's leg, and looks at me.%K%P

0x23CC
Makoto「... Hey?」%K%P

0x23D8
Boy「?」%K%P

0x23E4
Makoto「Do you know... what today's date is?」%K%P

0x23F0
Boy「Umm...」%K%P

0x23FC
Boy「Err...」%K%P

0x2408
Boy「The 1st?」%K%P

0x2414
Makoto「Thank you...」%K%P

0x2420
I pat the boy on his head, and head for Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0x2480
As I walk through the center of the wide park, I try%Nsurveying the area.%K%P

0x248C
Before long...%K%N

0x2498
... I spot a public telephone in a corner of the park.%K%P

0x24A4
I didn't notice it before, but it's a yellow-green%Nold-fashioned pay phone.%K%P

0x24B0
I immediately run over to it, and pick up the receiver.%K%P

0x24BC
First, I decide to call the friends of people who I'm on%Ngood terms with.%K%P

0x24C8
I call them one by one, and ask them for the date.%K%P

0x24D4
When I do, the response I get each time is "It's the 1st,%Nduh!"%K%P

0x24FC
...%K%P

0x2580
I pump nearly all the money I have on hand into the%Nphone to call place after place.%K%N

0x258C
TV stations... radio stations... telecommunications%Ncompanies... the Meteorological Agency... the Japanese%NMinistry of Defense...%K%PA court... a government office... the police... a hospital... a%Nchurch... a temple... a shrine... a school.%K%N%N

0x2598
Of course, I also dial random numbers.%K%N

0x25A4
I try asking strangers from nearly every prefectures, to%Nthose up north in Hokkaido to those down south in%NOkinawa.%K%P

0x25B8
However, everyone replies with this, as if it's obvious.%K%N%N

0x25C4
"Today is April 1st."%K%N%N

0x25D0
There's no more room for doubt.%K%N%N

0x25DC
Today—is April 1st.%K%N%N

0x25E8
In other words...%K%N

0x25F4
I really...%K%P

0x2654
... Time... traveled...%K%P
