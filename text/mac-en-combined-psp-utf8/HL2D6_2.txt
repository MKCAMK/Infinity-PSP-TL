No! I can't give up here!%K%P

0x4C
Something inside me tells me that.%K%P

0x58
Haruka's still alive.%K%N

0x64
Her flame of light hasn't flickered out yet.%K%P

0x80
There's one possibility remaining. I'll risk everything on%Nthat possibility!%K%P

0x94
There's one possibility remaining. I'll risk everything on%Nthat possibility!%K

0x36F0
Hurry to the clinic.

0x36FC
I've got to go to the lodge.

0x134
The driver took Haruka in his car, and it was%Napproximately half an hour later that we arrived at the%Nclinic.%K%P

0x140
We woke up the sleeping doctor and quickly brought%NHaruka into the sickroom.%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「Saki, I'll leave Haruka to you!」%K%P

0x1F4
Saki「... Huh? Where are you going!?」%K%P

0x200
Makoto「Neither of us can give Haruka a blood transfusion!」%K%P

0x230
At this rate, even if she goes to the clinic, Haruka won't%Nhave enough blood to survive.%K%P

0x23C
I entrust Haruka to the driver who hit her to go to clinic,%Nand start running to seek the one who has the same%Nblood type as Haruka... Her Original... Kurumi.%K%P

0x248
If I'm looking for her, then she should be at the lodge%Nright now!%K%P

0x338
I run through the pouring rain until I finally arrive at the%Nlodge.%K Out of breath, I enter the living room to find that%NOkuhiko and Yuka are having a party all to themselves.%K%P

0x344
The area around them has become mountains of snacks%Nand empty beer cans.%K%N

0x350
It seems like Okuhiko has bonded with the very drunk%NYuka.%K%P

0x35C
I firmly hold back my explosive anger, and survey the%Nroom.%K%N

0x368
Kurumi was here when I left...%K%P

0x374
... But she's nowhere to be found. Where did that girl go...?%K

0x3708
Ask Yuka.

0x3714
Ask Okuhiko.

0x3B4
Makoto「Hey, Yuka, listen to me!」%K%P

0x3D0
Yuka「Yesh?」%K%P

0x3DC
Makoto「What's your blood type?」%K%P

0x3E8
Yuka「Uhh... Whaa ish it again?」%K%P

0x3F4
Makoto「Hurry up and answer me, dammit!」%K%P

0x408
Yuka「Eyam finkin' sherioushly! Don't talk to me like dat!」%K%P

0x414
Damn... she really reeks of liquor. She must have drunk a%Nlot...%K%P

0x420
Makoto「I get... I'm sorry, so please hurry up and tell me! I'm%Nbegging you!」%K%P

0x434
Yuka「Mmm, very well. Eyam... umm, 'A+'.」%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Damn! So it was no use after all...」%K%P

0x454
Yuka「Huh? Or maybe ish 'B+'??」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x474
Yuka「Huh? But eye alsho feel ish 'C+'... Eye dunno. Ahahahaha!」%K%P

0x480
Y-You damn drunkard... Repressing the urge to yell at%Nher, I try to get information about Kurumi out of her.%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「Well, forget the whole blood type thing... What happened%Nwith Kurumi?」%K%P

0x4A0
Yuka「Kurumi-tan? Dunno.」%K%P

0x4AC
Crap. I click my tongue.%K Has she already gone home?%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「See you. I'm gonna look for Kurumi.」%K%P

0x4CC
Yuka「Huld on, Mako-tan! If yer talkin' to me, den come and have%Na drink!」%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「I don't have time for that! Haruka was run over by a car!!%NShe needs Kurumi's help!」%K%P

0x4EC
Yuka「Huh? Run ove bai Kurumi? ... Haruka wash run over bai%NKurumi-tan?」%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「Forget it! Later!!」%K%P

0x50C
Shit! I've lost a considerable amount of time! Even so,%Njust where could Kurumi be?%K%P

0x5A4
I once again throw myself into the pelting rain...%K%P

0x630
... ... ...%K%P

0x6A0
In the end, I couldn't find Kurumi, so I returned to the clinic.%K%P

0x6F8
Haruka lies down on the bed, her face pale...%K%P

0x714
Makoto「Okuhiko! Haruka's in trouble!!」%K%P

0x720
Just then, Okuhiko, who had been held down by Yuka,%Nquickly stands up.%K%P

0x734
Okuhiko「Wh-What!? What happened to Haruka-chan!?」%K%P

0x740
Makoto「... She was run over... by a car...」%K%P

0x98C
In the next instant, I collapse from receiving an intense%Nblow to my left cheek.%K%N

0x998
Okuhiko had hit me with a very powerful straight left...%K%P

0x9A4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9B8
Okuhiko「You stupid bastard! Why did that happen while she was%Nwith you!?」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「... Sorry...」%K%P

0x9D8
Okuhiko「Apologizing won't solve anything! So, what should I do!?」%K%P

0x9E4
Makoto「Okuhiko...」%K%P

0x9F8
Okuhiko「Shut up! I'm not doing this for your sake! I'm doing it for%NHaruka-chan's!」%K%P

0xA04
This is the first time I've seen Okuhiko look so serious.%K%N

0xA10
He's... really serious about Haruka's sake...%K%P

0xA1C
Makoto「I understand. Listen carefully...」%K%P

0xA28
Makoto「To save Haruka, we need a large amount of blood. But%Nthe clinic on this island doesn't have any blood%Ncompatible with her type in stock.」%K%P

0xA34
Makoto「That's why there's no other method but to give her a%Ndirect blood transfusion.」%K%P

0xA40
Makoto「We have to take it from someone who has a blood type%Nof B-, like Haruka, or O-...」%K%P

0xA54
Okuhiko「What was that...? Goddammit, I'm A+... Is there anyone%Nelse?」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「Kurumi is B-...」%K%P

0xA74
Okuhiko「If you need Kurumi-chan, she went outside earlier!」%K%P

0xA80
Makoto「Did she go back to Lunabeach?」%K%P

0xA8C
Okuhiko「I don't know! She didn't say if she was going back!」%K%P

0xA98
Makoto「All right, then I'll try going to Lunabeach!」%K%P

0xAA4
Makoto「You search around this area! If by any chance Kurumi%Ncomes here...」%K%P

0xB3C
I write down the clinic's contact address on a note, give%Nit to Okuhiko, and rush out into the rain.%K%P

0xB54
Okuhiko「Ishihara! I'm counting on you!」%K%P

0xBA8
I quickly start running towards Lunabeach.%K%P

0xBB4
If she's not here, the possibility she returned to%NLunabeach is very high.%K%P

0xBC0
And in the worst-case scenario that she's not there, if I%Nborrow the bicycle at the shop, I can search faster...%K%P

0xC48
BANG, BANG! BANG, BANG! ... I pound on the door to%NLunabeach with enough force to break it.%K%P

0xC54
Izumi「Yesss... who is it〜?」%K%P

0xC60
It seems that Izumi-san is still awake.%K%P

0xC6C
Makoto「It's me! It's Ishihara!」%K%P

0xC9C
Izumi「Yes, yes. What is it?」%K%P

0xCA8
When the door opens, I see Izumi-san standing there%Nwhile rubbing the sleep out of her very drowsy eyes.%K%P

0xCBC
Izumi「Geez... I'm not done counting the stock, you know...%NMakoto-kun, would you give me a little help?」%K%P

0xCC8
Makoto「N-Now's not the time for that! Is Kurumi back!?」%K%P

0xCDC
Izumi「Kurumi isn't here right now. She said she was going to%Nvisit the lodge, so...」%K%P

0xCE8
Damn... She didn't come back here either!?%K%P

0xCF4
Makoto「Haruka was in a car accident... she needs... a blood%Ntransfusion!!」%K%P

0xD08
Izumi「W-What was that!? Haruka-chan's been hurt?」%K%P

0xD14
Makoto「Calm down, Izumi-san! So... what's your blood type!?」%K%P

0xD28
Izumi「My... My blood type is O+!」%K%P

0xD34
Damn...! So Kurumi really is the only one...?%K%P

0xD40
Makoto「Haruka is B-! Kurumi's... Kurumi's also B-, isn't she!?」%K%P

0xD54
Izumi-san frantically nods at my words.%K%P

0xD60
I feel a little relieved and restless at the same time.%K%P

0xD6C
(Kurumi! Where are you right now!?)%K%P

0xD78
(Even though... Even though you're the only one I can%Nrely on right now...!!!)%K%P

0xD8C
Izumi「What should I do?」%K%P

0xD98
Makoto「Izumi-san, stay here!」%K%P

0xDA4
Makoto「If by any chance Kurumi and I miss each other and she%Ncomes back, I want you to take her to this clinic!」%K%P

0xDB0
I quickly write the address of the clinic Haruka's at, and%Nhand it to Izumi-san.%K%P

0xDBC
Makoto「Well then, I'm going to look! ... Ah, is it all right if I borrow the%Nbike!?」%K%P

0xDD0
Izumi「Of course! The faster you are, the better!! Save her...%NSave Haruka!」%K%P

0xDE4
I give her a powerful nod, and jump on the bike...%K%P

0xDF0
The sharp, piercing rain mercilessly obstructs my path.%K%N

0xDFC
It feels like everything in this world is trying to interfere%Nwith my actions.%K%P

0xE08
But I have to go.%K%N

0xE14
Even if the whole world turns against me...%K%N

0xE20
I will definitely save Haruka!!%K%P

0xEA4
Well then... where should I look?%K%N

0xEB0
What place would Kurumi go out to at this time...%K%P

0xEBC
...!!%K%P

0xEC8
Hey! Makoto!!%K%N

0xED4
Goddammit, calm down!!%K%N

0xEE0
Why would a high-schooler go out this late on a stormy%Nnight!?%K%P

0xEEC
Calm down... calm down...%K%N

0xEF8
First, I've got to think calmly...%K%N

0xF04
I won't find her if I search blindly...%K%P

0xF10
Think about why Kurumi went outside.%K%N

0xF1C
Remember... Remember... Remember!%K%N

0xF28
Remember Kurumi's behavior when I left the lodge!%K%P

0xF34
There's got to be a hint somewhere in Kurumi's speech%Nand conduct

0xF40
that should help me find her!!%K%P

0xF4C
...%K%P

0xF58
The reason Kurumi had to go outside... What was it...?%K

0x3720
To look for me...?

0x372C
She suddenly wanted to take a walk...?

0x3738
I don't know...

0x103C
Kurumi「Wait! Wait, Onii-chan! Where are you going!? Don't leave%NKurumi alone!!」%K%P

0x10AC
Suddenly, Kurumi's words fly by my mind...%K%P

0x10B8
(Don't tell me... She went out... in order to look for me...?)%K%P

0x10C4
Kurumi「So Kurumi wants to make as many memories as possible%Nwith you and the others in the time we have left.」%K%P

0x10D0
Kurumi... Kurumi came to see me.%K%N

0x10DC
Since I'm going back tomorrow...%K%N

0x10E8
Since we might not be able to see each other again...%K%P

0x1110
But even if that's true, that still doesn't give me any%Nspecific clues to Kurumi's whereabouts.%K%P

0x111C
At any rate, it's already been more than two hours since%NI left the lodge...%K%P

0x1128
Unfortunately, I have no choice but to search the whole%Nisland.%K%P

0x1134
I'll start around here first.%K%P

0x1140
To search farther away would be a waste of time.%K%P

0x114C
Once again, I push my body weight into the pedals...%K%P

0x11A4
(Damn! Did she suddenly want to take a walk... is that it!?)%K%P

0x11B0
Geez, why at such an important time, Kurumi!?%K%P

0x11BC
Makoto「In the first place, why would you go out and take a walk%Nin the middle of a rainy night!?」%K%P

0x11C8
Although no one else is around, I shout this in an urge to%Nvent.%K%P

0x11D4
The slowly creeping shadow of fate turns my intense%Nirritation to anger.%K%N

0x11E0
I try to channel my rage into my legs, and start pedaling%Nthe bike like a speed demon.%K%P

0x11EC
She's definitely got to be nearby.%K%P

0x11F8
I'll definitely find you, Kurumi!%K%P

0x1204
Wait for me, Haruka!!%K%P

0x122C
In the pouring rain, I commence my search for Kurumi.%K%P

0x127C
... I don't know!!!%K%N

0x1288
There's no way I would know!!%K%P

0x1294
In the first place, if she's a normal girl, then she shouldn't%Nbe outside on this rainy night!%K%P

0x12A0
But it's impossible for me to read the mentality of an%Nabnormal girl.%K%P

0x12AC
(No, wait...)%K%P

0x12B8
Just then, I am struck with a certain thought.%K%P

0x12C4
(Why didn't Kurumi come back even though it's so late?)%K%P

0x12D0
(... Perhaps it's because something happened to Kurumi%Nas well!)%K%P

0x12DC
The uneasiness inside me begins to grow more and more.%K%P

0x1304
In the endless downpour, I pedal on the bike with all my%Nstrength.%K%P

0x1310
(Haruka... Kurumi... wait for me!!)%K%P

0x13AC
Haruka... Is Haruka still alive...?%K%P

0x13B8
If my memories are correct, then my watch alarm should%Ngo off shortly after Haruka dies...%K%P

0x13C4
That's certainly... "4:30 A.M."...%K%P

0x13D0
There's no mistake.%K%N

0x13DC
Because the alarm was set for the time I went to go see%Nthe shiranui with Haruka...%K%P

0x13E8
So that means for my time limit, I have... Two and a half%Nhours left!!%K%P

0x13F4
Where do I look...?%K%N

0x1400
Where should I look...!?%K%N

0x140C
Where the hell should I look...!?%K%P

0x1418
My hands that are grasping the handles slip.%K%N

0x1424
My legs get twisted from pedaling the bike.%K%N

0x1430
Although it seems like I'm about to fall countless times, I%Ndon't slow down.%K%P

0x143C
Kurumi... Kurumi... Where are you...? Where are you right%Nnow...? Tell me... Kurumi...!%K

I can't find her...%K%P

I can't find Kurumi...%K%P

0x19E4
I want to go to the clinic... I want to be by Haruka's side...%K

0x381C
Fucking dumbass! You can't let Haruka die!

0x3828
Haruka... I'm sorry... I couldn't...

0x1A24
Not yet...!%K%N

0x1A30
I won't... give up...!%K%N

0x1A3C
I pedal even harder... as if to cast aside my own%Nweakness.%K%P

0x1A60
I can't find Kurumi...%K%N

0x1A6C
I decide to give up on the search.%K%P

0x1AC4
But I have one last remaining hope...%K%N

0x1AD0
The helicopter heading towards the clinic transporting%Nthe blood.%K%P

0x1ADC
... ... ...%K%P

0x1AF0
Haruka lies down on the bed, her face pale...%K%P

0x1B8C
I don't see Kurumi here...%K%N

0x1B98
I'll go look somewhere else.%K%P

0x1BAC
No good! She's nowhere to be found!!%K%N

0x1BB8
Where could she possibly be...!?%K%P

0x1BCC
To what extent will fortune abandon me?%K%P

0x1BD8
Am I being toyed around by some invisible power or%Nsomething?%K%P

0x1BE4
But whether or not such a power exists, it doesn't%Nconcern the current me.%K%P

0x1BF0
Even if it exists, I'll throw that power down.%K%P

0x1BFC
I'll smash fate into tiny pieces!%K%P

0x1C08
Haruka... Haruka... Wait for me...!%K%P

0x1C28
I ride the bike at full speed...%K%P

0x1C34
Makoto「My cries are drowned out by the noisy rainfall. It's even%Nhard for me to hear myself.」%K%P

0x1C5C
KURUMIIII! ANSWER MEEEEE!!%K%P

0x1C68
Makoto「I instinctively start complaining about Kurumi...」%K%P

0x1C74
Dammit... damn you, Kurumi...%K%N

0x1C80
But back then, I was the one who abandoned her and%Nleft the lodge.%K%P

0x1C8C
If I had been nicer towards her, then this probably%Nwouldn't have happened...%K%P

0x1C98
I bite my lips, and recommence my search for Kurumi.%K%P

0x1D28
When I come to my senses, I've been brought to a%Nstandstill in the middle of the road.%K%P

0x1D34
Over there... is the scene of Haruka's accident...%K%P

0x1D40
Although the rain has washed most of it away, there are%Nstill painful traces of blood on the asphalt remaining.%K%P

0x1D4C
As usual, the rain shows no signs of stopping.%K%N

0x1D58
If anything, it's only grown stronger.%K%P

0x1D64
My entire body is soaked, as if I'd been through a%Nwaterfall.%K%P

0x1D70
I feel completely frozen and numb.%K%N

0x1D7C
My hands grasping the handles, my feet on the pedals... I%Ncan't feel them... I can't feel anything...%K%P

0x1D88
I can't find Kurumi...%K%N

0x1D94
I've dropped by Lunabeach at fixed intervals all this%Ntime, but there's no sign of her coming back.%K%P

0x1DA0
Even though I've searched so much, I can't find her...%K%N

0x1DAC
It's as if the existence known as Kurumi has completely%Nvanished from this planet...%K%P

0x1DB8
The current time is "3:30 A.M."...%K%P

0x1DC4
Only one hour... until my time limit is up...%K%P

0x1DD0
Is it... too late now...?%K%P

0x1DDC
At the very least, I might be able to make it to the clinic in%Ntime to stay by Haruka's side until the end...%K%P

0x1DE8
Or should I not give up and continue searching...? Even if%Nit's a useless endeavor...%K

0x3834
I should at least stay with her...

0x3840
I won't give up until the end!!

0x1E28
At the very least... At the very least, I should stay by%Nher at least at the very end...%K%N

0x1E34
That's... the only thing the current me can do...%K%P

0x1E40
I cheer up my stiff body once more, and head to the%Nclinic where Haruka is waiting.%K%P

0x1EA4
... ... ...%K%P

0x1EC8
Haruka lies down on the bed, her face pale...%K%P

0x1F04
(There's no way in hell... that I'll give up until the end!!)%K%P

0x1F10
I... I swore it...%K%N

0x1F1C
On that day... that night when I saw the shiranui with%NHaruka...%K%P

0x1F28
"I'll protect Haruka,"... ... I swore that...!!%K%P

0x1FC8
Haruka「I understand... I'll trust you.」%K%P

0x1FDC
Haruka's voice...%K%P

0x1FE8
That's right... Haruka trusts me!%K%N

0x1FF4
So... I can't betray Haruka!%K%P

0x203C
... But... at this rate...%K%P

0x2048
At this rate, history will just repeat itself, right...?%K%N

0x2054
And then... will I be sent flying back to the past again...?%K%P

0x2060
The next time I go back, I won't necessarily have my%Nmemories.%K%P

0x206C
I might lose all my memories of Haruka.%K%N

0x2078
And naturally, Haruka will forget about me too...%K%P

0x20E8
Haruka「I won't leave. I also love this world where you exist too%Nmuch...」%K%P

0x2130
Suddenly... memories of Haruka go rushing through me...%K%N

0x213C
When she looked at me... her gaze...%K%N

0x2148
The feel of her arms... her warmth... Her soft lips...%K%P

0x2158
—I don't want to forget that!%K%N

0x2164
—I don't want to lose that!%K%P

0x2170
So I've got to think!%K%P

0x217C
Am I forgetting something...?%K%N

0x2188
Is there something important that I'm forgetting...?%K%P

0x2194
Once again, I shift through the threads of my memories.%K%N

0x21A0
I concentrate all my nerves...%K%P

0x21BC
...!?%K%P

0x21D8
A flash suddenly runs through my head. The thing I%Nremember in that instant... is...%K%P

0x21F0
A flash suddenly runs through my head.%K The thing I%Nremember in that instant... is...%K

0x384C
Kurumi's words...

0x3858
My words...

0x2294
Kurumi「After this, do you wanna go on a Mystery Tour?」%K%P

0x22A0
Kurumi「Yep. Kurumi wants to go check out that so-called 'Shiki%Nno Mori Shrine' and see if the rumors are true or not.」%K%P

0x22AC
Kurumi「Well? It sounds kinda fun, doesn't it?」%K%P

0x2310
That's right...%K%N

0x231C
On the night of the 2nd, Kurumi definitely said that.%K%P

0x2328
I picture Kurumi's pouting face at Izumi-san's opposition...%K%P

0x2364
I realize that I still haven't searched that shrine yet.%K%P

0x2370
Perhaps... Kurumi's... at the shrine...?%K%P

0x237C
I unhesitantly ride towards the shrine...%K%P

0x23D0
But... Kurumi's not here either...%K%P

0x23DC
... She's not... here either...%K%N

0x23E8
Haruka... what should I...%K%P

0x245C
... ... ...%K%P

0x24A4
And I have one last remaining hope... The helicopter%Nheading towards the clinic transporting the blood.%K%P

0x24C4
Haruka lies down on the bed, her face pale...%K%P

0x2510
Makoto「I'm going to look for Haruka!」%K%P

0x2524
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x2530
Makoto「I'll be back soon, so wait in the lodge!」%K%P

0x25BC
That's right...%K%N

0x25C8
When I left the lodge, I definitely said that.%K%P

0x25D4
"Wait at the lodge!" ...%K%P

0x25E0
Entrusting everything on my last hope, I ride to the%Nlodge...%K%P

0x2678
Just a little more, and I'll be at the lodge...%K%N

0x2684
But... If Kurumi isn't there either...%K%N

0x2690
I can think nothing but bad thoughts.%K%P

0x269C
—Just then, someone calls out!%K%P

0x26A8
Okuhiko「OI! ISHIHARAAA!!! I FOUND HER, OVER HERE!!」%K%P

0x26B4
Okuhiko's shouting voice brings me to my senses.%K%N

0x26C0
I pedal towards the direction of his voice with enough%Nforce to break the bike's pedals!%K%P

0x26CC
Makoto「OKUHIKO!! WHERE ARE YOU!?」%K%P

0x26D8
My vision is obstructed by the heavy rain, so I can only%Nadvance in the direction of his voice.%K%P

0x26E4
Okuhiko「Over here! Towards the lodge!!」%K%P

0x2724
Kurumi and Okuhiko descend the lodge's stairs huddling%Nclose together.%K%N

0x2730
She's restlessly holding a large umbrella...%K%P

0x2750
Kurumi「Ah! Where did you go, Onii-chan!?」%K%P

0x275C
Makoto「I was... looking for you!!!」%K%P

0x2780
Kurumi「For Kurumi? ... But Onii-chan, you left so suddenly...」%K%P

0x278C
The umbrella Kurumi is holding out is designed for men.%K%N

0x2798
Could it be... that she went outside to try to give it to me?%K%P

0x27A4
But now's not the time to think about things like that!%K%P

0x27B0
Makoto「Kurumi! Ride in the back!」%K%P

0x27C4
Kurumi「Huh, huh? Don't be pushy, Onii-chan〜」%K%P

0x27D0
Makoto「Look, just hurry!!」%K%P

0x27E4
Once I confirm Kurumi is riding on the luggage carrier,%K%N

0x27F0
I pedal the bike faster than I ever have before.%K%P

0x280C
Okuhiko「I'll leave the rest to you!」%K%P

0x2860
Dammit! Can I make it in time!?%K%N

0x286C
Now that Kurumi's riding with me, I head straight for the%Nclinic.%K%P

0x2878
On the way, Kurumi's umbrella gets blown away by the%Nwind, but I can't worry about that.%K%N

0x2884
It seems Kurumi has also realized that I'm not my usual%Nself right now, and so she remains quiet.%K%P

0x28B0
... ... ...%K%P

0x28BC
I was so focused on pedaling that I don't know what%Nhappened after that...%K%P

0x28E0
When I come to my senses, the clinic is right before my%Neyes.%K%P

0x28EC
But the bike's chain has become wrecked, so it can%Nnever be used again.%K%P

0x28F8
Makoto「... Kurumi... go into that clinic...」%K%P

0x2904
Makoto「... I'm counting on you... please save her...」%K%P

0x2918
Kurumi「...! Got it!!」%K%P

0x2970
And then, my consciousness drifts far away from reality...%K%P

0x297C
(Haruka... please... live...)%K%P

0x29D0
When I wake up, I see Haruka's peaceful sleeping face%Nbefore my eyes...%K%P

0x29DC
That face... it's like she's Sleeping Beauty herself.%K%P

0x29E8
No... "sleeping face" might not be the correct%Nexpression...%K%P

0x29F4
Perhaps... Haruka's...%K%P

0x2A00
I stare at Haruka's face for a short time.%K%P

0x2A0C
... How much time has passed?%K%P

0x2A18
Unable to hold it in, hot tears spill over and fall from my%Neyes.%K%N

0x2A24
My endless flood of tears begins to fall from my eyes%Nonto Haruka's face...%K%P

0x2A30
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x2A3C
Before I know it, I forget the pain in my whole body, and%Nkiss Haruka on her lips.%K%P

0x2A58
... It's warm...%K%N

0x2A64
... Haruka's breath... is warm...%K%N

0x2A70
—WARM!?%K%P

0x2AA0
Haruka「... Good morning.」%K%P

0x2AAC
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x2AB8
Haruka「Sleeping Beauty... was awakened by a kiss, right?」%K%P

0x2AC4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2AFC
... ... ...%K%P

0x2B08
There's so much I want to talk to her about.%K%N

0x2B14
There's so much I want to ask her.%K%N

0x2B20
But first and foremost, I just want to tell her this.%K%P

0x2B2C
Makoto「I'm so glad... that you're alive...」%K%P

0x2B38
Makoto「Because you're my irreplaceable... most precious...%Nperson...」%K%P

0x2B44
And then, I gently embrace Haruka.%K%N

0x2B50
Her body's warmth is ensuring her existence...%K%P

0x2C10
Makoto「!!」%K%P

0x2C1C
Saki is way ahead on the street...%K%P

0x2C28
The puppy, having found its master, goes running%Ntowards her from the opposite side.%K%P

0x2C60
And then, the headlights cut through the darkness...%K%P

0x2C6C
... From thereon out, it's the second coming of my former%Nnightmare.%K%N

0x2C78
Everything is the same as that time, as that night...%K%P

0x2C84
Makoto「HARUKAAAAA!!!!!」%K%P

0x2C90
I wring out a loud scream from within my body...%K%N

0x2C9C
I failed again... I couldn't save her...%K%P

0x2CA8
I... I... couldn't protect Haruka...%K%P

0x2D10
... ... ...%K%P

0x2D24
With his skillful handling, the doctor performs%N"hemostasis treatment", which seems to have at least%Nsuccessfully stopped the bleeding.%K%P

0x2D30
However, by the looks of things, I know that it's too early%Nto jump to conclusions.%K%P

0x2D58
Doctor「... I hate to tell you this, but... She's already lost most of%Nthe blood in her body. ... Her blood pressure is already%Nconsiderably low...」%K%P

0x2D64
Doctor「She only... has an hour or two left...」%K%P

0x2D70
Saki「No way!」%K%P

0x2D7C
Doctor「A blood transfusion... As long as she has a blood%Ntransfusion, she might recover somehow.」%K%P

0x2D88
Doctor「... Her blood type is B-... Are either of you B- or O-?」%K%P

0x2D94
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2DA0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2DAC
I now know that our blood types are incompatible.%K But%Nthere's nothing I can do about it anymore.%K%N

0x2DB8
I can't do anything about it...%K%P

0x2DD4
I touch Haruka's hand.%K%P

0x2DE0
Haruka, who was energetic just a few hours ago... Haruka,%Nwho was smiling just hours ago... Haruka, who was looking%Nat me just a few hours ago...%K%P

0x2DF4
At that moment, Haruka's eyes suddenly open.%K%P

0x2E00
Makoto「...!」%K%P

0x2E0C
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0x2E18
Haruka's eyes are blank.%K She stares into space, not%Nnoticing me.%K%P

0x2E24
Makoto「I'm right here... Haruka...」%K%P

0x2E30
I grasp Haruka's hand. I grasp it strongly, stronger than%Never before, hoping that she'll notice my existence...%K%P

0x2E3C
Haruka「That hurts...」%K%P

0x2E48
She says it in a weak voice. I frantically lessen the%Npower of my grip.%K%P

0x2E54
Makoto「S-Sorry...」%K%P

0x2E60
Haruka「No, don't be...」%K%P

0x2E6C
She continues staring into space. She might not even%Nhave the power to turn her own head...%K%P

0x2E94
Makoto「Haruka... Haruka...%K I... I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0x2EA0
Guh. A thick sound comes from inside my chest. My voice%Nhas become tearful, bursting out of me like water%Ngushing from a dam.%K%P

0x2EAC
Makoto「I don't want that. I couldn't bear it...」%K%P

0x2EB8
Haruka「... It's all right, Makoto.」%K%P

0x2EC4
Haruka「Because soon, we'll go fishing together again...」%K%P

0x2ED0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2EDC
Haruka「... I'm sorry, Makoto. I'm a little tired... I guess I shouldn't%Nhave taken that evening stroll after all...」%K%P

0x2EE8
Makoto「... Ha... Haruka...」%K%P

0x2EF4
Haruka「I've got to sleep... Yuka's going to scold me for this%Ntomorrow...」%K%P

0x2F10
Her eyes slowly begin to close...%K%P

0x2F1C
No... Wait... Wait... Haruka...%K%P

0x2F28
Haruka「I'm going to sleep now, okay...? Good... night...」%K%P

0x2F3C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2F48
Haruka's hand limply slips out of my own and dangles...%K%P

0x2F54
In the next instant... Something slips out of it.%K%P

0x2F7C
The object lying on the floor... is...%K%P

0x2FB8
It's that bell again...%K%P

0x2FC4
Makoto「!!」%K%P

0x2FE8
I look at Haruka's face. It looks peaceful, so very%Npeaceful.%K%P

0x2FF4
Her eyes will never open again...%K%P

0x3000
(Damn this thing, damn this thing...!)%K%P

0x3028
I kick the fallen bell away.%K%N

0x3034
The bell rings as it recoils off the wall.%K%P

0x306C
My field of vision clouds.%K And in that instant, I break down%Nweeping.%K%N

0x3078
The tears pour out of me one after another.%K I can't stop.%K I%Ndon't want them to stop.%K%P

0x3084
In the end, I couldn't change anything.%K%N

0x3090
Although I knew everything beforehand, I couldn't%Nchange anything.%K%P

0x30B8
(... So history will repeat countless times...?)%K%P

0x30C4
And so, I will probably go to meet Haruka again.%K%N

0x30D0
—A Haruka who doesn't know me...%K%P
