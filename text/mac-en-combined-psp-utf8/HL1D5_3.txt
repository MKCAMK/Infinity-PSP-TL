And thus, the two of us have once again gone to the%Npier.%K%P

0x80
While setting up the fishing gear, I suddenly look up at%Nthe sky.%K%N

0x8C
It's heavily covered with clouds.%K%N

0x98
We're definitely not getting any good weather today.%K%P

0xA4
Even so, Haruka cheerfully dangles her fishing line.%K%N

0xCC
Mine is dangling in the water as well, though, in truth... My%Nheart's not really into it.%K%P

0xF4
(Just being able to be with Haruka is enough, right...?)%K%P

0x100
But as usual, my line's not getting a single bite.%K%N

0x10C
Of course, it's just me who's having this problem...%K%P

0x120
Haruka「Wow... I caught another one. Here, look. I caught a really%Nbig one this time!」%K%P

0x12C
As usual, Haruka keeps wheeling in a multitude of big%Ncatches.%K%P

0x138
(Why is she so much better than me?)%K%P

0x144
It's a little frustrating not being able to catch anything,%Nbut just seeing Haruka like this makes it all worth it.%K%P

0x150
The days I've spent getting to know this side of her run%Nthrough my mind.%K%P

0x15C
A clone... Saki said with confidence that Haruka is a clone.%K%P

0x168
But why? Even if it's the truth, how did Saki even know%Nabout that?%K%P

0x174
The question I had two days ago still floats in my head.%K%P

0x180
And then Haruka said that she was just somebody's%Ncopy. She said that she had no heart.%K%P

0x18C
Could... Could any person really not have a heart?%K%P

0x198
It's impossible for me to believe that, as she's having so%Nmuch fun right now.%K%P

0x1A4
I try comparing the Haruka I see now to the one I saw%Nwhen we first met. The difference is huge, isn't it?%K%P

0x1B0
Haruka has really changed.%K%P

0x1BC
The current Haruka frequently has very humane%Nexpressions.%K%P

0x1C8
I can definitely feel emotion in them.%K%P

0x1D4
Little by little, I think that Haruka is finding that which is%Ncalled her "heart".%K%P

0x1E8
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0x1F4
Haruka's voice pulls me back to reality.%K%P

0x200
It probably looked like I was spacing out.%K She's been%Nlooking at me curiously as I pondered.%K%P

0x20C
Haruka「... Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x218
Makoto「No, it's nothing...」%K%P

0x22C
Haruka「???」%K%P

0x238
Makoto「It's just that for some reason or other, I was%Nremembering everything that's happened between us%Nsince we first met.」%K%P

0x244
Haruka「You were thinking about me...?」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「Yeah. A lot of things have happened in the last five%Ndays, huh?」%K%P

0x274
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x280
Makoto「Haruka...?」%K%P

0x2A8
As Haruka firmly grasps her fishing rod, her eyes keenly%Nfocus on the faraway horizon...%K%P

0x2B4
(A lot of things really did happen...)%K%P

0x2C0
I indulge in my thoughts again.%K%P

0x2CC
To Haruka, it's probably been one large series of events.%K%N

0x2D8
Her being exposed as a clone...%K%P

0x2E4
Her receiving Okuhiko's sudden "love confession"...%K%N

0x2F0
Her continuous quarrels with Saki, their true%Ncircumstances still unknown to me...%K%P

0x2FC
And also, her first... kiss.%K%P

0x318
(...)%K%P

0x324
And then, I am taken aback as I realize it.%K%P

0x330
(When... did I start to believe I did it as a favor for%NHaruka?)%K%P

0x33C
I didn't do it as a favor or out of any paternal feelings...%K%P

0x348
I did it to her because of the genuine feelings I have for%Nher... as a... woman...%K%P

0x370
(But what about Haruka...?)%K%P

0x37C
(What does Haruka... think of me?)%K%P

0x388
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x39C
Haruka slowly turns her face towards me. There's not a%Nsingle drop of emotion to be found in her expression.%K%P

0x3A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3B4
Haruka「What is it?」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3CC
I want to confirm it. What does Haruka think of me?%K%P

0x3D8
But if Haruka feels that I'm someone like a father to her,%Nthen I couldn't bear it.%K%N

0x3E4
If she doesn't see me as a man, then...%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「No, it's nothing...」%K%P

0x404
Haruka returns her gaze to the ocean.%K%N

0x410
Her coldness only increases my anxiety.%K%N

0x41C
My uneasiness is starting to eat me alive.%K%P

0x428
(Should I ask her...? Or should I just leave it...?)%K%P

0x434
As I grasp my fishing rod, I continue to worry endlessly...%K%P

0x4B0
When noon arrives, the two of us decide to grab some%Nlunch at Lunabeach as always.%K%P

0x4F4
I look at the lunch menu as Haruka orders a sandwich.%K%P

0x534
Izumi「Well now, it seems like you two are really hitting it off.」%K%P

0x540
Izumi-san teases us as she approaches us.%K%P

0x54C
Makoto「No, it's not like...」%K%P

0x558
Feeling a little embarrassed, I instinctively avert my%Neyes.%K%P

0x564
I throw a fleeting glance at Haruka.%K%N

0x570
She's silently nibbling her sandwich.%K%N

0x57C
Despite her dainty bites, the way she eats makes me%Nfeel that she has a large appetite...%K%P

0x590
Izumi「At any rate, Haruka-chan...」%K%P

0x59C
Izumi「This is the third day in a row you've come here for lunch,%Nisn't it? You're not tired of this?」%K%P

0x5B8
Haruka「... It's because I like fishing.」%K%P

0x5C4
She says this as bluntly as always...%K%P

0x5D0
(Hey... you don't have to be so blunt...)%K%P

0x5DC
Well, I already know by now that's just normal behavior%Nfor Haruka...%K%P

0x5E8
But I've noticed that whenever she's talking to Izumi-san,%Nshe always becomes blunter than usual.%K%P

0x5F4
I scowl as I hold back the urge to scold Haruka for her%Nbehavior. That's no way to treat others, after all.%K%N

0x600
Could it be... that Haruka dislikes Izumi-san?%K%P

0x61C
Izumi「Well, if you like doing it, then that's fine.」%K%P

0x628
Izumi-san turns her attention towards me.%K%P

0x63C
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you also come here every day. Is it just%Nbecause you like fishing?」%K

0x1250
Yeah...

0x125C
Not exactly...

0x67C
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x688
I take a bite out of my lunch as I answer.%K%P

0x69C
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6BC
It seems like that wasn't the answer Izumi-san was%Nhoping to hear from me.%K%N

0x6C8
Izumi-san returns to the counter, as if having lost%Ninterest.%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「Not exactly...」%K%P

0x6F0
Makoto「Fishing is all right and all... But it's more that I just want to%Nbe with Haruka, that's all...」%K%P

0x6FC
Wh-What am I saying!?%K%N

0x708
My words cause my face to grow hot.%K%P

0x71C
Izumi「Oh my, this was a rather unrefined thing to ask you...%NPlease continue eating.」%K%P

0x728
My earlobes get so hot that it feels like steam is coming%Nout of them.%K%P

0x734
(Ugh... I shouldn't have said anything.)%K%P

0x748
It seems like that was the answer Izumi-san was hoping%Nto hear from me.%K%N

0x754
She gives me a satisfied nod before returning to the%Ncounter.%K%P

0x784
Haruka continues to silently eat her sandwich.%K%N

0x790
It feels like she's completely engrossed in her food.%K%N

0x79C
It's obvious that she didn't hear a single word of our%Nconversation just now...%K%P

0x7B0
Before long... as if noticing my glance, Haruka looks in my%Ndirection.%K%N

0x7C4
A sweet smile rises to her face.%K%P

0x7D0
(Huh? Who's she looking at?)%K%P

0x7DC
Wait, it's not like there's anyone else here but me, right?%K%P

0x7E8
Haruka is showing only me that human-like expression.%K%N

0x7F4
That alone makes me happy.%K%P

0x818
Kurumi「Onii-chan♪」%K%P

0x848
Kurumi comes over to us after finally finishing her work in%Nthe main part of the restaurant.%K%P

0x854
She's carrying a tray in her hands. On it is the coffee I%Nordered.%K%N

0x860
However, I am unable to immediately respond to her.%K%P

0x86C
My attention is solely focused on Haruka's heartwarming%Nsmile.%K%N

0x878
Strong emotions burst from inside me and overwhelm all%Nof my senses...%K%N

0x884
I smile to myself.%K%P

0x898
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan!」%K%P

0x8A4
Suddenly, Kurumi yanks my ear.%K%N

0x8B0
It seems that she's become irritated at me for not%Nanswering her.%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「O-OWWWWW...!!」%K%P

0x8D0
Kurumi「Onii-chan! Are you listening!?」%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「I'm listening, I'm listening! I'm listening, so let go of me!」%K%P

0x8F0
With a sullen, angry expression, Kurumi finally lets go of%Nme.%K%P

0x8FC
Makoto「Wh-What is it...?」%K%P

0x910
Kurumi「You and the others are going back the day after%Ntomorrow, right?」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x930
Kurumi「So Kurumi wants to make as many memories as possible%Nwith you and the others in the time we have left.」%K%P

0x93C
Makoto「Memories, huh...」%K%P

0x950
Kurumi「And so... Kurumi was thinking that she'd go sleep over at%Nthe lodge tonight〜♪」%K%P

0x95C
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x970
Kurumi「Mmph! What's with that tone?」%K%P

0x97C
Makoto「Huh? N-No, I didn't mean anything in particular by-」%K%P

0x9A0
Kurumi「Screw you, Onii-chan! Hmph!」%K%P

0xBC4
Kurumi slaps the coffee cup on the table with all her%Nmight!%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「H-HOOOT!!」%K%P

0xC04
The boiling hot coffee flies in the air and directly hits my%Npants!%K%P

0xC10
Makoto「K-Kurumi... g-get me a dish cloth...!」%K%P

0xC34
Kurumi「Hmph!」%K%P

0xC48
Kurumi completely ignores me, acting like nothing%Nhappened...%K%P

0xC5C
Izumi「Makoto-kun! Are you okay!? You're not burned, are you?」%K%P

0xC68
Izumi-san frantically runs over to me.%K%N

0xC74
She quickly hands me a dish towel.%K%P

0xC80
... *Wipe, wipe*... *Wipe, wipe*...%K%P

0xC8C
(Dammit, Kurumi...!)%K%P

0xCB0
Just then, Haruka suddenly stands up.%K%N

0xCC4
She averts her eyes from Kurumi and Izumi-san, and%Nquickly starts to leave the shop.%K%P

0xCD0
(???)%K%P

0xCDC
I give Izumi-san a slight bow, and pursue Haruka outside.%K%P

0xD54
Haruka「Kurumi...」%K%P

0xD60
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xD6C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xD78
Makoto「What about Kurumi?」%K%P

0xD84
Haruka「Kurumi... she seemed happy.」%K%P

0xD90
Makoto「Huh? What are you saying? She was really pissed off at%Nme, wasn't she...?」%K%P

0xD9C
Haruka「No... Not that... I mean before that.」%K%P

0xDA8
Makoto「Before that?」%K%P

0xDB4
Haruka「Kurumi's always so cheerful... she's a good girl.」%K%P

0xDC0
Makoto「Well, she certainly is cheerful... but I don't know if that%Nnecessarily makes her a good girl...」%K%P

0xDCC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xDD8
Makoto「Is something wrong?」%K%P

0xDE4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xDF0
Makoto「Haruka?」%K%P

0xDFC
Haruka's expression hardens.%K%N

0xE08
Seriously, what's wrong...? She's making me worried...%K%P

0xE1C
Haruka「... It's nothing.」%K%P

0xE28
Makoto「You say it's nothing, but that's not true, is it?」%K%P

0xE34
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xE40
But Haruka doesn't answer.%K%P

0xE4C
No, it's more like she's stubbornly refusing to talk.%K%N

0xE58
For the rest of our trip back to the pier, Haruka doesn't%Nsay a word...%K%P

0xED4
We grab our fishing poles once again.%K%P

0xF04
The change in Haruka's face due to fishing is miraculous.%K%P

0xF10
Although Haruka looked so depressed a short while ago,%Nshe's now completely back to being cheerful.%K%N

0xF1C
Not a single trace of gloom can be found on her beaming%Nface as she enthusiastically fishes.%K%P

0xF28
(Mmm... just what's with this quick change in attitude...?)%K%P

0xF34
(It's... well, whatever.)%K%P

0xF40
Just looking at Haruka's cheerful expression fills me with%Nhappiness.%K%P

0xF4C
Makoto「Hey, Haruka? How about a fishing contest this%Nafternoon?」%K%P

0xF60
Haruka「Huh? Between you and me? Hmm...」%K%P

0xF74
Haruka「I accept your challenge...」%K%P

0xF80
Makoto「All right! That's the spirit!」%K%P

0xF8C
And so, against better judgement, I lay down this%Nreckless challenge.%K%P

0xF98
Of course, the result is obvious from a mile away...%K%P

0xFD0
... ... ...%K%P
