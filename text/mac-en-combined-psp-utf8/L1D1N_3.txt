We all ran away, back to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x4C
In the half hour we've been here, I've been thinking about%N"that" this whole time...%K%P

0x58
"Haruka falling down on Moon Beach", "The shortage of%Nrice"... and this time, "The earthquake and Izumi-san%Nfalling into the pool."%K%P

0x64
"An earthquake's coming." ... No one has paid any%Nattention to what I said back there.%K%P

0x70
Right now, they're engaged in a conversation about%Nsomething else entirely.%K%P

0xA0
Okuhiko「Thank god♪ For a moment, I thought we were screwed...」%K%P

0xBC
Saki「I thought the security guard would catch Izumi-san,%Nsince she was falling behind...♪」%K%P

0xD8
Kurumi「If it weren't for Haruka-san's quick thinking, we'd all be%Ncaught right now♪」%K%P

0xF4
Okuhiko「No one else would have thought to take off that guard's%Nhat〜♪」%K%P

0x108
Saki「Normally, you wouldn't have noticed that he was wearing%Na wig under there either♪」%K%P

0x124
Kurumi「And then Haruka-san threw it into the center of the%Npool♪」%K%P

0x140
Okuhiko「I still remember the look on his face...♪」%K%P

0x14C
Everyone「Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...!♪」%K%P

0x168
Haruka's trying very hard not to get flustered, but her%Nface is clearly starting to flush.%K%P

0x17C
Just then...%K%P

0x1A0
Saki「Huh? What's wrong, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x1AC
... Suddenly, Saki says this, having noticed my change in%Nbehavior.%K%P

0x1D4
Makoto「No... it's just...」%K%P

0x1F0
Kurumi「Are you thinking about something?」%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「I guess you could say that...」%K%P

0x208
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x214
Makoto「How do I put this... Earlier... I experienced an unusual%Nphenomenon...」%K%P

0x230
Haruka「An unusual... phenomenon?」%K%P

0x23C
Hmm... how do I explain it to them?%K

0xA90
Simply say "I had a premonition."

0xA9C
Express it in vaguer terms.

0x27C
Makoto「If I had to put it in a word... it was a 'premonition'.」%K%P

0x288
I simply tell them this.%K%P

0x294
I don't know why, but all of the sudden, I've been given%Nthe power to receive premonitions.%K%P

0x2A0
No matter how I think about how to explain this%Nphenomenon, the only way I can think of how to express%Nit is, "I've been given the power to receive premonitions."%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「Somehow, I had a premonition of the future...」%K%P

0x2C0
I vaguely mumble this.%K%P

0x2CC
I don't know why, but all of the sudden, I've been given%Nthe power to receive premonitions.%K%P

0x2D8
No matter how I think about how to explain this%Nphenomenon, the only way I can think of how to express%Nit is, "I've been given the power to receive premonitions."%K%P

0x2F4
Okuhiko「Huh???」%K%P

0x300
Okuhiko jeers at my claim.%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「Right... I said it earlier, didn't I? Before Izumi-san fell into%Nthe pool... I said 'An earthquake's coming'...」%K%P

0x328
Kurumi「Ah... now that you mention it...」%K%P

0x334
Makoto「Also, this afternoon, I somehow knew that the shop was%Nout of rice...」%K%P

0x350
Saki「Right...」%K%P

0x35C
Makoto「I didn't mention this before, but I also knew Haruka was%Ngoing to fall on Moon Beach...」%K%P

0x378
Haruka「Huh...?」%K%P

0x394
Okuhiko「Hey, hey, is this your idea of a joke, Ishihara?」%K%P

0x3A0
Okuhiko looks at me with a sharp, piercing glare.%K%P

0x3B4
Okuhiko「Or could it be that you're trying to trick us?」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「You idiot! Why would I want to do that?!」%K%P

0x3CC
Okuhiko「Why else would you say all that crap unless you had%Nsomething you wanted to gain from it?」%K%P

0x3F0
Okuhiko「In other words, so you could just be mocking us for your%Nsick entertainment...」%K%P

0x3FC
Makoto「... What?」%K%P

0x408
Okuhiko「After all, today is April Fool's Day...」%K%P

0x414
Okuhiko「I didn't know you still practiced that obsolete tradition.」%K%P

0x420
Makoto「You're wrong! That's not it at all! This isn't an April Fool's%NDay joke, dammit!」%K%P

0x434
Okuhiko「Yes, yes... I get it, I get it...」%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Bullshit! You clearly don't believe me!」%K%P

0x454
Okuhiko「Really, I do. I'll try believing you.」%K%P

0x460
Okuhiko「Well then, Great Teacher Ishihara. What premonitions%Nhave you received about tomorrow?」%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「W-Well...」%K%P

0x480
Okuhiko「Huh? With all due respect, shouldn't you know that,%NTeacher?」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4A0
Okuhiko「In that case, what about ones regarding what will%Nhappen in one hour... no, in one minute...?」%K%P

0x4AC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4C0
Okuhiko「Huh!? Could it be you can't even receive premonitions%Nabout that?」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「... I-I don't think it works that way...」%K%P

0x4E0
Okuhiko「Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!♪」%K%P

0x510
Okuhiko「See? It's exactly as I thought after all.」%K%P

0x524
Okuhiko「I don't mind if you want to trick us, but it's no fun if you%Nuse such a flimsy lie.」%K%P

0x530
Okuhiko「That's the kind of stuff that not even a child would be%Nfooled by...」%K%P

0x54C
Saki「But wait a second...」%K%P

0x558
Saki「I don't think he could have lied about the rice and the%Nearthquake...」%K%P

0x564
Thankfully, Saki comes to my rescue.%K%P

0x570
However...%K%P

0x57C
Okuhiko「You're wrong, Saki-chan...」%K%P

0x590
Saki「???」%K%P

0x59C
Okuhiko「This afternoon, when we first came in, what was it that%Nyou said, Kurumi-chan?」%K%P

0x5A8
Okuhiko「I believe it was, 'Today, we had a party of tourists come%Nin for lunch...'」%K%P

0x5C4
Kurumi「Yeah, you're right...」%K%P

0x5D0
Okuhiko「From those words, Ishihara probably deduced, 'They%Nmust have used up a ton of rice.'」%K%P

0x5EC
Haruka「Well then... what about the earthquake...?」%K%P

0x5F8
Okuhiko「That one barely needs an explanation.」%K%P

0x604
Okuhiko「It's simply because 'The first person to notice the start%Nof the earthquake was Ishihara.'...」%K%P

0x610
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x624
Okuhiko「Ha ha! Are you trying to play dumb?」%K%P

0x638
Okuhiko「Basically, when Ishihara shouted, 'An earthquake's%Ncoming,' it had already started.」%K%P

0x644
Okuhiko「We were all so focused on Izumi-san and Kurumi-chan's%Ngame, so we didn't notice...」%K%P

0x650
Okuhiko「But if Ishihara wasn't, then he might have felt some light%Nshaking that we didn't—In other words, the preliminary%Ntremors.」%K%P

0x65C
Okuhiko「Naturally, if you notice the preliminary tremors,then it's%Nsimple to guess right about the arrival of the main tremor.」%K%P

0x668
Haruka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x684
Saki「I get it now...」%K%P

0x6A0
Kurumi「So that's what happened...」%K%P

0x6BC
Okuhiko「Ishihara... wouldn't it be better for you to confess now?」%K%P

0x6D0
I say nothing.%K%P

0x6DC
I've lost the will to.%K%P

0x6E8
There's nothing more depressing than nobody believing%Nyou when you're telling the truth.%K%P

0x6F4
I feel like an innocent suspect who's been accused of%Nmurder.%K%P

0x700
(It's not like they've lost faith in me, so I guess it's fine...)%K%P

0x70C
This still sucks.%K%P

0x718
Just then...%K%P

0x73C
Izumi「Whew... that was refreshing♪」%K%P

0x748
Izumi-san rejoins us after finishing her shower.%K%P

0x75C
Izumi「I have some strawberries in the fridge, would you like%Nsome?」%K%P

0x768
In the end, the topic of my premonitions is quickly%Nforgotten...%K%P
