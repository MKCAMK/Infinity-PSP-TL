Yuka「Ah, I can't find it〜」%K%P

0x68
I hear Yuka complaining in the thicket.%K%P

0x74
In one arm, I'm carrying a plastic container with 39 tennis%Nballs inside.%K%P

0x80
There's only one left... but we can't find that last one%Nanywhere.%K%P

0x8C
Roughly half an hour has passed since we started%Nsearching.%K%P

0x98
Yuka「Geez, why'd you have to hit it so far...」%K%P

0xA4
Makoto「What the hell are you saying!? Weren't you the one who%Nhit all the balls that went over the fence?」%K%P

0xB0
It's true.%K%P

0xBC
Occasionally, Yuka would lose focus and hit the balls in%Nridiculous directions.%K%P

0xC8
Whether it was serving or volleying, her skill was mostly%Nthe same as a beginner's, but when she hit it powerfully,%Nit was like she was trying to score a home run.%K%P

0xD4
Geez... I can't decide whether she's really good or really%Nbad.%K%P

0xE8
Yuka「You can't say that!」%K%P

0xF4
Makoto「Why not!?」%K%P

0x108
Yuka「Only the winner has the privilege to say that!」%K%P

0x114
Makoto「Ugh...」%K%P

0x120
She's right.%K%P

0x12C
Yuka's technically the winner, since she won one more%Ncomplete set than I did. We continued the match for an%Nhour afterwards, but in reality, until the last ball had flown%Nover the fence, I had lost one more set than Yuka.%K%P

0x150
Makoto「Idiot, if we'd finished the game-」%K%P

0x164
Yuka「You could've made a comeback?」%K%P

0x170
Makoto「Hell yeah!」%K%P

0x17C
Yuka「You really think so?」%K%P

0x188
Makoto「Of course!」%K%P

0x194
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x1A0
She ponders it.%K%P

0x1B4
Yuka「Well, whatever.」%K%P

0x1C0
Yuka「Let's hurry up and find the ball. We're wasting time.」%K%P

0x1D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1E0
In the end, to her, "a loss is a loss."%K%P

0x1EC
Since Yuka is the winner, she only hears my bluffs as%Nexcuses.%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「Damn!」%K%P

0x204
I click my tongue.%K%P

0x218
Yuka「C'mon, Makoto! Don't just space out; hurry up and look%Nfor the ball!」%K%P

0x22C
Yuka urges me on as she continues to search through%Nthe bushes.%K%P

0x238
Makoto「Haaah...」%K%P

0x244
As I begin to trudge through the thicket, I let out a weary%Nsigh.%K%P

0x250
(Anyway...)%K%P

0x25C
(Why does she just call me "Makoto" without any%Nhonorifics...?)%K%P

0x268
When I thought of this question earlier today, I just%Njumped to conclusions and thought I understood it, but%Nwhen I really stop to think about it, it doesn't make sense.%K%P

0x274
After all, we only just met yesterday...%K%P

0x280
I stop walking, and look at her.%K%P

0x294
The sunlight pours in through the trees, allowing the%Ngreen grass to soak in its beams.%K%P

0x2A0
I can see Yuka beyond the trees, grasping her racket in%Nher left hand as she looks around for the ball.%K%P

0x2AC
She looks a little bored.%K%P

0x2B8
How can she urge me on if she's not even serious about%Nthis?%K%P

0x2C4
Her exposed legs are covered in dew.%K%P

0x2D0
Her curves are so soft and round... Her alluring, smooth%Nskin is dazzling with pure gloss.%K%P

0x2DC
Suddenly, a southern wind blows through the trees, and%Nher scent reaches my nose.%K%P

0x2E8
It's a sweet and pleasant scent, like ripened fruit.%K%P

0x2F4
(Yuka, huh...)%K%P

0x300
—Hmm???%K%P

0x30C
Yuka???%K%P

0x318
All of the sudden, I realize something.%K%P

0x324
(Come to think of it, I've just been calling her "Yuka"%Nwithout any honorifics either!)%K%P

0x330
I'm the same as she is.%K%P

0x33C
And now that I think about it, it hasn't been just Yuka.%K%P

0x348
I've been addressing Haruka and Okuhiko without any%Nhonorifics either, haven't I?%K%P

0x354
(... Why's that?)%K%P

0x360
My mind's a little joggled right now from that sweet scent.%K%P

0x36C
(Anyways, isn't it weirder that I didn't notice how%Nunnatural this was until now?)%K%P

0x378
At that moment...%K%P

0x394
Yuka「Ah!」%K%P

0x3A0
... Yuka lets out a shout.%K%P

0x3AC
Yuka「Found it!」%K%P

0x3C8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3D4
In the end, she thinks that "a loss is a loss."%K%P

0x3E0
Since Yuka is the winner, she only hears my bluffs as%Nexcuses.%K%P

0x3F4
Yuka「See, you don't even have a comeback.」%K%P

0x400
Because I don't say anything back, Yuka becomes smug.%K%P

0x40C
... I am a little sore after all.%K%P

0x418
Yuka「Hmm? What? If you've got something to say, then say it.%NThough it's probably an excuse...」%K%P

0x424
Shit! I really ought to think up a comeback!%K%P

0x438
Yuka「C'mon, Makoto. Don't just stand around there, hurry up%Nand look for it!」%K%P

0x444
In the end, I just kept my mouth shut.%K%P

0x458
Yuka urges me on as she continues to search through%Nthe bushes.%K%P

0x464
Makoto「Haaah...」%K%P

0x470
As I begin to trudge through the ticket, I let out a weary%Nsigh.%K%P

0x47C
(Anyway...)%K%P

0x488
(Why does she just call me "Makoto" without any%Nhonorifics...?)%K%P

0x494
When I thought of this question earlier today, I just%Njumped to conclusions and thought I understood it, but%Nwhen I really stop to think about it, it doesn't make sense.%K%P

0x4A0
After all, we only just met yesterday...%K%P

0x4AC
I stop walking, and look at her.%K%P

0x4B8
...%K%P

0x4C4
The sunlight pours in through the trees, allowing the%Ngreen grass to soak in its beams.%K%P

0x4D0
I can see Yuka beyond the trees, grasping her racket in%Nher left hand as she looks around for the ball.%K%P

0x4DC
How can she urge me on if she's not even serious about%Nthis?%K%P

0x4E8
Suddenly, a southern wind blows through the trees, and%Nher scent reaches my nose.%K%P

0x4F4
It's a sweet and pleasant scent, like ripened fruit.%K%P

0x500
(Yuka, huh...)%K%P

0x50C
—Hmm???%K%P

0x518
Yuka???%K%P

0x524
All of the sudden, I realize something.%K%P

0x530
(Come to think of it, I've just been calling her "Yuka"%Nwithout any honorifics either!)%K%P

0x53C
I'm the same as she is.%K%P

0x548
And now that I think about it, it hasn't been just Yuka.%K%P

0x554
I've been addressing Haruka and Okuhiko without any%Nhonorifics either, haven't I?%K%P

0x560
(... Why's that?)%K%P

0x56C
My mind's a little joggled right now from that sweet scent.%K%P

0x578
(Anyways, isn't it weirder that I didn't notice how%Nunnatural this was until now?)%K%P

0x584
At that moment...%K%P

0x5A0
Yuka「Ah!」%K%P

0x5AC
... Yuka lets out a shout.%K%P

0x5B8
Yuka「Found it!」%K%P

0x5E8
Yuka holds the tennis ball high over her head,%Ntriumphantly.%K%P

0x5F4
Her innocent smile completely blows away all my irritation.%K%P

0x608
Yuka「Here!」%K%P

0x614
Yuka gently throws the ball.%K%P

0x620
I catch it with my right hand, and place it in the plastic%Ncontainer.%K%P

0x62C
40 balls... this is all of them.%K%P

0x640
Yuka「Hold on. I don't get a thank you or anything?」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「Thanks.」%K%P

0x660
Yuka「Ah! That tone... You're not grateful at all, aren't you?」%K

0xF60
This was your fault to begin with.

0xF6C
I'm grateful.

0x6A8
Makoto「Grateful?! You're the one who hit that home run ball in the%Nfirst place!」%K%P

0x6B4
Makoto「Even so, I helped you clean up your mess. You're the%None who should be thanking me.」%K%P

0x6C8
Yuka「Uwaa, you're still saying that?」%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「I'm grateful...」%K%P

0x6F8
Yuka「Ah, that sounded rather half-hearted...」%K%P

0x704
Makoto「Well then, what do you want!?」%K%P

0x710
Yuka「You should thank me... with more feeling in your voice.」%K%P

0x71C
(I DID say it just now with feeling, or at least I intended%Nto...)%K%P

0x728
Yuka「It's because you said it like that that you...」%K%P

0x73C
After that, she let out a string of insults. Well, she's%Npartially right, but...%K%P

0x748
No, I'm annoyed because she's right.%K%P

0x754
I'm getting angrier and angrier...%K%P

0x768
Yuka「Like I said before, if your serves hadn't been so%Npathetic, we wouldn't be in this mess!」%K%P

0x774
Makoto「Pathetic!?」%K%P

0x780
Makoto「If they were so bad, then why didn't you try returning%Nthem?」%K%P

0x78C
Yuka「Because they were way too pathetic...」%K%P

0x7A0
Yuka「Maybe I should have gone easier on you?」%K%P

0x7AC
Makoto「You're such a bitch! You think you're so high and mighty%Njust because you won one match!」%K%P

0x7B8
Makoto「I know! Let's have a rematch!」%K%P

0x7CC
Yuka「All right, I'm up for it!」%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka「In return, if I win...」%K%P

0x7EC
Makoto「If you win... what?」%K%P

0x7F8
Yuka「If I win, then you have to do something I want, no matter%Nwhat it is!」%K%P

0x804
Makoto「... And if I win?」%K%P

0x818
Yuka「Of course, you'll get the same prize if you win!」%K%P

0x824
Anything, huh? Let's do this!%K%P

0x830
Makoto「Interesting. I'll take on that bet!」%K%P

0x8C4
And so, we return to the net and face off again.%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka's insults, instead of hurting my feelings, have%Ngotten me all fired up instead.%K%P

0x8DC
It's easy to see why...%K%P

0x8E8
There's something refreshing about Yuka's blunt and%Ncarefree personality.%K%P

0x8F4
She's the type of girl who I'd say has a "candid" attitude.%K%P

0x900
Yuka「Hey, pathetic boy. Hurry up and serve!」%K%P

0x90C
The girl that's brighter than a summer day seems to fit in%Nwell with the spring sunlight.%K%P

0x918
I start to think that this Seminar Camp isn't so bad after%Nall...%K%P

0x970
... ... ...%K%P

0x9AC
After the match ended, Yuka and I talked about what to%Ndo next.%K%P

0x9B8
We didn't have enough strength to play another match,%Nbut it was too early to return to the lodge.%K%P

0x9C4
So in the end, we decided to go to the ocean to meet up%Nwith Haruka and Okuhiko.%K%P

0x9D0
When we finished chatting, we took showers in the%Nmanagement office.%K%P

0x9DC
The shower felt so wonderful and refreshing after being%Nin the sun for so long.%K%P

0x9E8
We're now heading towards the ocean while descending%Nthe long hill road.%K%P

0x9F4
By the way, the result of the match...%K%P

0xA24
Yuka「Well then, I wonder what I should have you do?」%K%P

0xA30
... is obvious just by looking at Yuka's expression.%K

0xF78
"Can we just forget about it?"

0xF84
"Stop lording it over me and say it."

0xA70
Makoto「Um... so, can we just forget about it?」%K%P

0xA7C
I try to wuss out...%K%P

0xA90
Yuka「Huh!!? What's with that!? Taking back your words is very%Nunmanly, you know!」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「... Ugh!!」%K%P

0xAB0
Yuka「If you're going to be like that, you shouldn't have asked%Nfor a rematch!」%K%P

0xABC
... But I thought Yuka was the one who suggested the%Nbet... Well, it's true that I did accept it...%K%P

0xAD0
Yuka「You can't take back your promise!」%K%P

0xADC
Makoto「Yeah, yeah...」%K%P

0xAF0
Yuka「I'll make you do the craziest thing I can think of.」%K%P

0xB0C
Makoto「Stop lording it over me and just say it.」%K%P

0xB18
Yuka「I wasn't really lording it over you. I'm seriously thinking%Nabout it.」%K%P

0xB2C
Yuka「Since I can only make you do one thing, I need to make it%Nthe craziest thing I can think of.」%K%P

0xB40
The craziest thing she can think of... I have a bad feeling%Nabout this.%K%P

0xB4C
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0xB58
Yuka「Mmm...」%K%P

0xB6C
Yuka「... Well, I'll think about it.」%K%P

0xB78
Makoto「Huh? You can't do that. Tell me now!」%K%P

0xB8C
Yuka「But I can't think of anything good. Besides, I never said%Nhow long this promise was valid for, did I?」%K%P

0xB98
Makoto「Well, that's true...」%K%P

0xBA4
Yuka「It might be tomorrow, or the day after... Maybe even in ten%Nyears.」%K%P

0xBB8
Yuka「Be sure to remember it ten years from now.」%K%P

0xBC4
Makoto「That's impossible!」%K%P

0xBD0
Yuka just smiles.%K%P

0xC54
We come out of the forest road, and arrive at the%Ncoastline.%K%P

0xC60
A bit to the west is a small cove surrounded by a rock%Nwall.%K%P

0xC6C
To the east is a long, wide beach with white sand.%K%P

0xC78
The small cove is called "Princess Beach", while the wide%Nbeach is called "Moon Beach".%K%P

0xC84
We first try going to Princess Beach. It made the most%Nsense to check there first, since it was closer.%K%P

0xC90
Just then...%K%P

0xCA4
Okuhiko「What are you doing in a place like this...?」%K%P

0xCB0
... We suddenly cross paths with them.%K%P

0xCBC
It seems they were just on their way back to the lodge.%K%P

0xCC8
Yuka explains that "We've already come down this far,"%Nso in the end, the four of us decide to leave for the%Nshopping district.%K%P

0xCD4
Well, considering how deserted that shopping district is,%N"leave for" might not be the best way to put it...%K%P

0xCE0
As we talk, Haruka averts her eyes, looking rather bored.%K%P

0xCEC
She told us she wanted to see the ocean, yet she%Ndoesn't seem very satisfied.%K%P

0xCF8
(What did she do there?)%K%P

0xD04
I listen to Yuka and Okuhiko's conversation while%Ncaptivated by Haruka's actions.%K%P

0xD10
Her soft hair sways in the sea breeze.%K%P
