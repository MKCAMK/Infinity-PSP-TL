None of us have anything we need to do in particular, so%Nwe all agree with Kurumi and Yuka's proposal.%K%P

0x84
Of course, we're not after tuna, but...%K%P

0x90
Right now, those two noisy girls are holding hands and%Nskipping down Moon Beach.%K%P

0x9C
And for some reason, Haruka is with them. Kurumi is%Nholding her hand, while Haruka is awkwardly being forced%Nto walk down the beach with a bewildered expression.%K%P

0xA8
Those two probably dragged her along.%K%N

0xB4
Watching them is kind of fun...%K%P

0xC8
Okuhiko「So what fish can you catch around here, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xD4
Okuhiko cocks his head to the side as he asks Izumi-san.%K%P

0xE8
Izumi「Let's see... well, there's various types of fish to catch...」%K%P

0xF4
Izumi「But everyone here is a beginner. So why don't we go to%Na place where we can catch some horse mackerels,%Nordinary mackerels, or sardines?」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「Oh, but what about the gear?」%K%P

0x114
Izumi「There's a fishing gear shop near the harbor that%Nprovides them... We'll just rent a few, since buying fishing%Nrods and reels there is expensive.」%K%P

0x128
Okuhiko「Near the harbor? Then does that mean we're not fishing%Nat Moon Beach?」%K%P

0x13C
Izumi「Right. It's not that it's so rocky around here that you%Ncan't catch anything, it's just that the harbor is safer.」%K%P

0x148
Izumi「Moreover, it's much easier to fish over there and it's%Nmore bountiful.」%K%P

0x154
Makoto「Huh... You must have been here for a long time to know%Nthis much.」%K%P

0x160
Izumi「Well, gossip is one of the tools of my trade.」%K%P

0x16C
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x180
When Izumi-san finishes talking, she walks over to a%Nparking lot a bit away from Lunabeach.%K%P

0x1E4
We follow her to find a white lightweight truck used for%Nbusiness parked over there.%K%P

0x1F0
It's an old car model that you never see at all these%Ndays...%K%P

0x1FC
There are some sections of chipped paint here and%Nthere, and the frame is covered in reddish-brown rust.%K%P

0x210
Saki「Don't tell me you're going to drive this thing...?」%K%P

0x21C
Saki gives a mildly nervous expression full of shock.%K%P

0x238
Izumi「Right. It's a little far for walking.」%K%P

0x244
Saki「So are you saying that we'll be riding in the cargo bay in%Nthe back?」%K%P

0x258
Izumi「Well, it might be nice to occasionally let loose and live a%Nlittle.」%K%P

0x264
Izumi-san quickly retorts with this.%K%P

0x278
Saki seems to accept Izumi-san's blunt answer.%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「But about the truck...」%K%P

0x298
Makoto「The battery's dead, isn't it?」%K%P

0x2A4
For some reason or another, I ask Izumi-san this.%K%N

0x2C0
I really... don't know why, though...%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi「Huh...?!」%K%P

0x2FC
Izumi-san's expression seems to momentarily tense up.%K%P

0x308
Saki and Okuhiko exchange glances.%K%P

0x330
The roar of the waves breaking against the shore is as%Nloud as the heavy echo of my body's core shaking.%K%P

0x33C
Izumi「That can't be right. I drove this the other day to stock%Nup, and it was working perfectly then...」%K%P

0x350
While Izumi-san says this...%K%P

0x378
... she gets into the car.%K%P

0x3BC
Izumi「H-Huh...?!」%K%P

0x410
Izumi「No way...」%K%P

0x4C4
Izumi「How... How did you know, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi「First the rice yesterday, then the earthquake... and then%Ntoday... this...」%K%P

0x4DC
Izumi「Could it be related to what you said yesterday...?」%K

0x1270
Dodge the question.

0x127C
Say it was a "premonition" one more time.

0x52C
Makoto「No, I don't think it's like that at all.」%K%P

0x538
I'm dodging the question.%K%P

0x544
Otherwise, it'll just be like yesterday... no one will believe%Nme if I say I had a premonition.%K%P

0x550
I don't want to experience the unpleasant feeling of%Nbeing like a falsely accused suspect ever again.%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「After all, this thing doesn't look like it's been very well%Nmaintained...」%K%P

0x568
Makoto「Just by taking one look at it, I figured 'there's no way%Nthis thing will move'.」%K%P

0x57C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x588
Izumi-san looks at me with a doubtful expression.%K%P

0x594
Makoto「Hey, it's just another coincidence, you know?」%K%P

0x5A0
Izumi「A 'coincidence', you say...」%K%P

0x5BC
Okuhiko「Come on, this doesn't matter, does it?」%K%P

0x5C8
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0x5D4
Okuhiko「Anyway, looks like we're walking.」%K%P

0x5E8
Okuhiko「If we don't hurry up, we might not have any time to go%Nfishing, right?」%K%P

0x5F4
Thankfully, Okuhiko smoothly changes the conversation.%K%P

0x608
Though now that he mentions it, the only way to the%Nharbor is by walking.%K%P

0x614
Makoto「Right, right. If we keep slouching around, the sun will go%Ndown.」%K%P

0x620
Trying to avoid Izumi-san's gaze as much as possible, I%Nback up Okuhiko.%K%P

0x684
Izumi「But Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x690
As I turn my back, Izumi-san says this in a way that says%N"I don't understand this at all."%K%P

0x69C
But I pretend not to hear her and quicken my pace.%K%N

0x6A8
Besides, the one who doesn't understand the most is%Nmyself.%K%P

0x6B4
Why did the words "The battery's dead, isn't it?" come%Nout of my mouth?%K%P

0x6C0
Somehow, it felt like it wasn't me who said it. I'm shrouded%Nby this irritating, uncomfortable sensation...%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「Yes. I don't really understand it myself, but it's probably%Nwhat you're thinking.」%K%P

0x6E0
Makoto「In other words...」%K%P

0x704
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara. Don't tell me you're going to start spewing%Nbullshit about how it was a 'premonition' again.」%K%P

0x710
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x71C
Okuhiko beats me to the punch, instinctively leaving me%Nat a loss for words.%K%P

0x730
Okuhiko「Just by looking at this car's state, it's natural to think%Nthat 'there's no way this thing will move'.」%K%P

0x73C
Okuhiko「In fact, Ishihara and I were thinking the same thing...」%K%P

0x750
Okuhiko「No offense, Izumi-san, but this car doesn't look like it's%Nhad maintenance in a long time.」%K%P

0x75C
Okuhiko's words are like an intimidating air that leaves me%Nwith no room to object.%K%P

0x768
(It's just like yesterday... I think it's safer if I stay silent.)%K%P

0x774
However, Izumi-san doesn't seem to be buying it.%K%P

0x788
Izumi「But in Makoto-kun's case, this isn't the only time he's—」%K%P

0x794
Okuhiko「Come on, Izumi-san! Geez, it doesn't matter, does it?」%K%P

0x7A8
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0x7BC
Okuhiko「Anyway, looks like we're walking.」%K%P

0x7D0
Okuhiko「If we don't hurry up, we might not have any time to go%Nfishing, right?」%K%P

0x7DC
For better or worse, Okuhiko manages to brush the topic%Nof my premonitions aside, not believing in them.%K%P

0x7F0
Now that he mentions it, though, the only way to get to%Nthe harbor now is by walking.%K%P

0x7FC
Makoto「Hey, Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x808
When Okuhiko isn't listening, I whisper to Izumi-san.%K%P

0x814
Makoto「I'll talk to you about it next time...」%K%P

0x820
I take my chance to leave her as she tries to search for%Na reply.%K%P

0x874
Izumi「'Next time'...」%K%P

0x880
Izumi-san says this in a way that makes it clear that she%Ndoesn't comprehend what's going on.%K%P

0x88C
I pretend not to hear her and quicken my pace.%K%N

0x898
Besides, the one who doesn't understand the most is%Nmyself.%K%P

0x8A4
Why did the words 'The battery's dead, isn't it?' come out%Nof my mouth?%K%P

0x8B0
Somehow, it felt like it wasn't me who said it. I'm shrouded%Nby an irritating and uncomfortable sensation...%K%P

0x948
For a short while, I walk through the tranquil rural%Nlandscape.%K%N

0x954
The chirping of songbirds and the sight of green plants%Nare calming, a contrast to my chaotic state of mind.%K%P

0x97C
Suddenly, I realize that someone's trying to catch up%Nwith me.%K%P

0x988
I don't even need to look over my shoulder to tell that%Nit's Izumi-san.%K%P

0x9A0
Everyone else has already passed me, and are walking%Nin front of me...%K%P

0x9AC
So to avoid Izumi-san's questioning, I should...%K

0x1288
Go with Yuka.

0x1294
Go with Kurumi and Saki.

0x12A0
Go with Haruka and Okuhiko.

0xA0C
At first, I think I should try waving and walking towards%NYuka...%K%P

0xA18
... However, I give up on that.%K%P

0xA24
I'm a little too scared to approach her after what%Nhappened earlier.%K%N

0xA30
If she starts yelling at me again, it would be nigh%Nimpossible to run away from her.%K%P

0xA3C
I think I'll...%K

0x12AC
Go with Kurumi and Saki.

0x12B8
Go with Haruka and Okuhiko.

0xA8C
I run over to Kurumi and Saki, who are walking together%Nand happily chatting.%K%P

0xACC
Kurumi「... Kurumi's completely happy.」%K%P

0xAD8
Naturally, since I came in the middle of the conversation, I%Nhave no clue what Kurumi's talking about.%K%P

0xAE4
I wouldn't normally butt into a conversation, or at least%Nwould be reluctant to, but I'd rather get everything else%Noff my mind right now.%K%P

0xAF0
So I try bluntly asking Kurumi "Happy about what?"%K%P

0xAFC
Just then...%K%P

0xB08
Saki「About us.」%K%P

0xB14
... Saki answers.%K%P

0xB20
Saki「I asked her 'Aren't we imposing too much on you and%Nyour sister?'」%K%P

0xB2C
Kurumi「That's why Kurumi said she was 'completely happy'...」%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「Wow... You're even good with that drunkard?」%K%P

0xB44
I briefly glance at Yuka, who's walking in front of us.%K%P

0xB58
Kurumi「Yeah! For some reason, Kurumi gets along really well with%NYuka-san♪」%K%P

0xB64
Well, it certainly did look that way...%K%P

0xB70
Kurumi「And you know what? Kurumi has been here the whole time%Nsince spring break began...」%K%P

0xB7C
Kurumi「So Kurumi was getting a little tired of just being alone%Nwith Onee-chan...」%K%P

0xB88
Makoto「Hmm.」%K%P

0xB94
Kurumi「Can Kurumi be honest with you? Until you guys came%Nyesterday, Kurumi just wanted to go home.」%K%P

0xBA8
Saki「What? If that's the case, then you should have called%Nout to me...」%K%P

0xBB4
I see... Now that she mentions it, Saki came here because%Nof her February exam break...%K%P

0xBC0
Saki「Then again, we only did just meet yesterday, so I%Nsuppose that couldn't be helped.」%K%P

0xBCC
Saki smiles.%K%P

0xBD8
(Nevertheless, being here since February is a long time...)%K%P

0xBE4
(Just what was Saki doing for two months all alone?)%K%P

0xBF0
I continue to think on the matter absentmindedly...%K%P

0xC0C
I run over to Haruka and Okuhiko, who are walking%Ntogether a bit ahead of me.%K%P

0xC3C
As soon as I catch up to them...%K%P

0xC50
Okuhiko「What is it, Ishihara?」%K%P

0xC5C
... Okuhiko glances at me with clear disdain.%K%P

0xC68
Makoto「No, I was just wondering what you two were talking about.」%K%P

0xC74
In face of that glare, I give an indifferent answer.%K%P

0xC80
Just then...%K%P

0xC8C
Haruka「Fishing... we were talking about fishing.」%K%P

0xC98
... Surprisingly, Haruka herself answers my question.%K%P

0xCAC
Okuhiko「Right, that's it. So it has nothing to do with you, Ishihara.」%K%P

0xCB8
Makoto「Oh? It has nothing to do with me? If I remember correctly, I%Nbelieve that I'm going fishing as well.」%K%P

0xCCC
Okuhiko「But Ishihara, I thought you didn't want to go?」%K%P

0xCD8
Makoto「Well... since Yuka is forcing us to go and all, I guess I am%Ncoming along unwillingly...」%K%P

0xCE4
Okuhiko「Right? So just get lost, Ishihara.」%K%P

0xCF8
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan and I, however, are in favor of going fishing.%NWe don't need a negative guy like you to kill the mood.」%K%P

0xD04
(You didn't even have a "mood" in the first place, did%Nyou!?) I feel like saying this, but I'll let it go...%K%P

0xD10
I'm just going to ignore him.%K%P

0xD1C
Anyway, I'm interested in knowing why Haruka is in favor%Nof this.%K%P

0xD28
I then try asking her, "Why did you want to go fishing?"%K%P

0xD3C
Okuhiko「You idiot, you don't understand that either?」%K%P

0xD48
Okuhiko looks at me with scorn.%K%P

0xD5C
Okuhiko「Fishing is a game played in real earnest between man%Nand fish. Complicated tactics are needed for this%Nmagnificent, romantic game.」%K%P

0xD68
Okuhiko「If you had to talk about the pleasant feeling you get at%Nthe moment your target arrives, it is something words%Ncannot conve-」%K%P

0xDAC
Haruka「Because I want to feel one.」%K%P

0xDB8
Haruka suddenly mutters this.%K%P

0xDC4
Haruka「Because I want... to feel a fish.」%K%P

0xDD8
Okuhiko「... Right! That's it! In short, that is exactly what we want to%Ndo.」%K%P

0xDE4
Haruka「I want to try feeling a living fish.」%K%P

0xDF0
Okuhiko「Yes, yes, I understand. In other words... it's that feeling%Nyou get when you come into contact with nature, er, how%Nto put it...」%K%P

0xDFC
Haruka「I want to try feeling a living fish's heart.」%K%P

0xE10
Okuhiko「... Huh?!」%K%P

0xE1C
Haruka「I want to feel its beating with my own fingertips.」%K%P

0xE30
Haruka「In order to hear... the echo of life...」%K%P

0xE3C
Haruka softly places her palm on her chest.%K%P

0xE48
It looks as if she's trying to feel her own heart beat.%K%P

0xE54
Of course, Okuhiko is at a complete loss of words.%K%P

0xE60
After that, we all remain completely silent...%K%P

0xEDC
Finally, we arrive at the shopping district.%K%P

0xEE8
Our destination is just past the fishing market, dead%Nahead of us.%K%P

0xEF4
There, Izumi-san gathers all the necessary gear from%Nthe local fishing gear shop.%K%P

0xF08
Izumi「Well then, shall we go?」%K%P

0xF14
Izumi-san begins to take charge as she distributes the%Ngear amongst us.%K%P

0xF20
Everyone obediently starts heading towards the harbor%Nas they curiously play with their reels and hooks.%K%P

0xF2C
As I'm about to take a step forward...%K%P

0xF40
Izumi「Hold on.」%K%P

0xF4C
... Izumi-san grabs my forearm.%K%P

0xF58
Izumi「About what happened earlier... we're going to have a%Nlong talk about it later, okay?」%K%P

0xF6C
Izumi-san leaves me with those words.%K%P

0xF78
Although her tone was kind, there was a piercing light in%Nher pupils.%K%P

0xF84
It was a threatening gaze that instinctively leaves me%Nunnerved.%K%P
