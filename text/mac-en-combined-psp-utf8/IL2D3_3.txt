Everyone goes outside, and enters the forest one by%None in succession.%K%P

0x4C
Just as I'm about to enter the thicket...%K%P

0x58
??「H-Hey... Makoto...」%K%P

0x6C
... I turn around when someone behind me suddenly calls%Nme. It's Yuka.%K%P

0xA4
Makoto「No way!」%K%P

0xB0
I immediately reply.%K%P

0xC4
Yuka「Wh-What the hell!? I haven't said anything yet!」%K%P

0xD0
Makoto「But I already know. You asked me last time, right? For us%Nto become a pair.」%K%P

0xE4
Yuka「Ugh...」%K%P

0xF0
Makoto「If you're that scared, then you shouldn't have%Nparticipated to begin with.」%K%P

0xFC
Yuka「B-But then Okuhiko-kun would start getting suspicious...」%K%P

0x108
Makoto「Oh brother...」%K%P

0x11C
Yuka「I-It's fine! It's not like I wanted to just pick you%Nspecifically!」%K%P

0x128
Makoto「There was another way.」%K%P

0x13C
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x148
Makoto「You could just have gotten drunk, like always.」%K%P

0x15C
Yuka「What do you mean by that...?」%K%P

0x170
Makoto「Yuka, what is it?」%K%P

0x17C
Yuka「R-Right... u-um?」%K%P

0x188
Yuka「So we're really going to do this... Test of Courage?」%K%P

0x194
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x1A0
Yuka「And... if this is like last time... then we'll be put... into pairs,%Nright?」%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「Well, obviously.」%K%P

0x1B8
Yuka「B-But you know what? I was thinking a bit...」%K%P

0x1C4
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0x1D8
Yuka「Wh-What's wrong, Makoto?」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「... This is my chance.」%K%P

0x1F0
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「Sorry Yuka, but I can't form a pair with you.」%K%P

0x210
Yuka「Wh-Why not!?」%K%P

0x258
Before Yuka can start objecting, I immediately head into%Nthe forest.%K%P

0x264
Thanks to Yuka, I got a good idea.%K%P

0x270
I quicken my pace, and before long, I've caught up to%NIzumi-san.%K%P

0x2A0
Izumi「What's wrong, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x2AC
Makoto「Izumi-san, we're really going to do this Test of Courage?」%K%P

0x2B8
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「And are we going to do pairs, like in the last one?」%K%P

0x2D0
Izumi「Well, that's only natural.」%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「Isn't it? And I think that when we get there, it's likely that%Nwe'll divide the pairs via Rock-Paper-Scissors...」%K%P

0x2E8
Izumi「Yes, yes.」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「Therefore... I wanted to discuss something with you.」%K%P

0x300
Izumi「?」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「Izumi-san, will you use scissors during%NRock-Paper-Scissors?」%K%P

0x320
Izumi「Huh...? Wait, are you saying...」%K%P

0x32C
Makoto「Yes, that's it.」%K%P

0x340
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「W-Well... if you don't want to, that's fine...」%K%P

0x358
Izumi「No, that's not it...」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「Anyway, I'll be going with scissors.」%K%P

0x378
Izumi「... I understand. I'll do as you say, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x384
Makoto「Izumi-san, thank you!」%K%P

0x3A8
I leave with these words, and catch up with the others.%K%P

0x3B4
The chance I've been waiting for has finally arrived.%K%P

0x3C0
If Izumi-san and I become a pair, then we'll be out of%NOkuhiko's eyesight, and I'll be able to tell Izumi-san%Nwhatever I want.%K%P

0x3CC
O-Of course... I intend...%K t-to confess to her...%K%P

0x3D8
I can't hold back the loud pounding of my heart.%K%P

0x3EC
Suddenly, when I look up ahead, I see Okuhiko whispering%Nsomething to Haruka.%K%P

0x400
When Okuhiko notices my glance, he quickly moves away%Nfrom her.%K%P

0x414
(What are you planning, Okuhiko?)%K%P

0x420
I'm a little concerned about it, but all I can think about%Nright now is Izumi-san.%K%P

0x42C
Okuhiko and Haruka are of no concern to me right now.%K%P

0x47C
We arrive at the graveyard.%K%P

0x488
As always, this place has a spooky atmosphere.%K%P

0x494
Izumi-san insists that this place is completely safe, but%Nwe can't believe those words.%K%P

0x4A0
Yuka especially doesn't. She'll probably never grow%Naccustomed to here no matter how many times she visits.%K%P

0x4AC
We then begin to divide the pairs through%NRock-Paper-Scissors.%K%P

0x4DC
Okuhiko「Ready, Set! Rock, Paper, Scissors...」%K%P

0x4F0
Okuhiko eagerly leads us off, and we all make fists with%Nour dominant hands.%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「... Go!」%K%P

0x508
Like I said earlier, I have scissors.%K%P

0x51C
Izumi-san also has scissors.%K%P

0x528
(It's decided...)%K%P

0x534
With that, I turn my hand so that my fingers turn into a%Npeace sign.%K%P

0x548
But I am shocked when I see everyone else's hands.%K%P

0x554
Yuka, Okuhiko, and Haruka all have scissors.%K%P

0x560
(Huh? What's... the meaning of this?)%K%P

0x574
Okuhiko「O-One more time. Ready, Set! Rock, Paper, Scissors...」%K%P

0x588
Makoto「... Go!」%K%P

0x594
Again, everyone has scissors...%K%P

0x5A0
Everyone「...」%K%P

0x5AC
For a few more rounds after that, everyone continues to%Ngo with scissors.%K%P

0x5C0
Okuhiko「Damn... there's no other choice... Scissors is banned from%Nnow on!」%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x5E8
Izumi「I guess it can't be helped...」%K%P

0x5F4
Dammit! Goddammit!!%K%P

0x600
In other words, I won't know what Izumi-san's next hand%Nwill be...%K%P

0x624
Okuhiko「Rock, Paper, Go!」%K%P

0x638
Okuhiko's voice cruelly echoes in the graveyard.%K%P

0x644
In the end, the pairs are decided as so.%K%P

0x650
Me - Yuka.%K%N

0x65C
Haruka - Izumi-san.%K%N

0x668
Okuhiko — all alone.%K%P

0x67C
Okuhiko dejectedly sits down on a nearby tombstone...%K%P

0x6E8
Reluctantly, I go with Yuka to find the well.%K%P

0x6F4
We already know where it is. I want to just hurry up and%Nget this over with...%K%P

0x708
Yuka「Whew... I thought I was going to have to go alone for a%Nlittle while.」%K%P

0x714
Makoto「Good for you.」%K%P

0x728
Yuka「Wh-What the hell!? In the first place, if you hadn't%Nrejected me, then...」%K%P

0x760
—Suddenly, the bushes shake.%K%P

0x774
Yuka「KYAAAAA!」%K%P

0x788
Yuka is so surprised by the sound that she latches%Nonto me.%K%P

0x7AC
Makoto「Uwaa!」%K%P

0x7B8
I lose balance, and end up embracing Yuka in order to%Nstand my ground.%K%P

0x7CC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x7D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x7E4
We silently stare into each other's eyes...%K%P

0x80C
Yuka's cloudy eyes make me instinctively tremble.%K%N

0x818
Her body is trembling too.%K%P

0x824
I can't move; my body's gone numb.%K%P

0x830
No... maybe it's more like I don't want to move.%K%P

0x83C
Yuka「See...」%K%P

0x848
Yuka「You're scared too...」%K%P

0x854
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x860
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x86C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x878
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x884
Makoto「H-Hey, Yuka? ... That's why we should just hurry up and%Nget this over with, so if you would just let go of me...」%K%P

0x898
But Yuka's too shaken.%K%P

0x8A4
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0x8B0
Yuka「I can't... my legs are too frozen to move...」%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka「B-But...」%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x8E8
Yuka「There might be one method that can get me walking%Nagain...」%K%P

0x8F4
Makoto「... What method?」%K%P

0x900
Yuka「If... If...」%K%P

0x90C
Yuka「If I were to say that I needed your help, Makoto... would%Nyou do it...?」%K%P

0x918
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x924
I want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.%K%P

0x930
Yuka and I are embracing each other... if Izumi-san were%Nto see us, then...%K%P

0x93C
Yuka「Then...」%K%P

0x960
Yuka says this, and quietly brings her face close to mine.%K%N

0x96C
The scent of sweet shampoo from her hair drifts in the%Nair.%K%P

0x978
Yuka「That method... is for you to kiss me... Makoto.」%K%P

0x984
... ... ... ... What?%K%P

0x998
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x9A4
H-Hold on...%K%N

0x9B0
HOLD ON!!!!!%K%N

0x9BC
How did things come to this?!%K%P

0x9C8
Makoto「Y-Yuka...?」%K%P

0x9D4
My voice is full of disbelief.%K%N

0x9E0
For some unknown reason, this has to be a joke.%K%N

0x9EC
At least, that's what I want to believe.%K%P

0xA00
Yuka「Idiot! There's no way that I'd say that!!」%K%P

0xA14
She'd laugh as she said it... But that's merely what I'd%Nhoped she say, not what she's actually doing.%K%P

0xA20
After all, there's Izumi-san. ... I already have someone...%Nwho told me they love me!%K%P

0xA2C
But...%K%P

0xA5C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xA68
Yuka's eyes are serious...%K%N

0xA74
Huh...? Is she serious?%K%N

0xA80
I feel like I could cry.%K%P

0xA8C
Yuka「Please... give me... courage.」%K%P

0xA98
... She's serious.%K%N

0xAA4
Why... Why is Yuka doing this now...?%K%N

0xAB0
Now I really want to cry...%K%P

0xAC4
Yuka「... Makoto...」%K%P

0xAD0
My heart is beating very fast.%K%P

0xADC
Yuka's lips...%K%N

0xAE8
Yuka's small lips...%K%N

0xAF4
Yuka's soft, trembling lips...%K%P

0xB00
Izumi-san's face and Yuka's face overlap.%K%P

0xB0C
I... I...%K

0x1188
When petticoats woo, breeks may come speed.

0x1194
I have Izumi-san...!

0xB80
I gradually...blank out.%K%P

0xB8C
Yuka... Yuka...%K%N

0xB98
Before long... my shadow becomes one with Yuka's%Nshadow...%K%P

0xBB4
...%K%P

0xBC0
(... Did I... do... it?)%K%P

0xBCC
My consciousness grows faint, and I suddenly fall into a%Nwhite world...%K%P

0xBE0
(Izumi-san...!!)%K%P

0xBEC
I clench my hands into fists, and barely manage to%Nsqueeze my voice out.%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「I'm sorry... I... can't.」%K%P

0xC0C
Yuka's face is sad.%K%P

0xC18
Makoto「Um... it's not like... I hate you or anything, Yuka.」%K%P

0xC24
Makoto「It's just... well... I don't think we have that kind of%Nrelationship...」%K%P

0xC30
I'm talking frantically. It's as if I'm desperately making an%Nexcuse to justify myself.%K%P

0xC3C
Yes, that's probably it... my heart's throbbing so much%Nbecause I feel guilty.%K%P

0xC58
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0xC64
Yuka mutters this with regret.%K%P

0xC70
Makoto「I'm sorry... but that's... my final word on it...」%K%P

0xC7C
I apologize once more.%K%P

0xC90
Yuka「Oh, looks like I stopped trembling when I wasn't paying%Nattention. ... Geez, I guess it was nothing after all.」%K%P

0xC9C
Yuka returns to her normal self as if nothing ever%Nhappened.%K%P

0xCA8
Her swift change in attitude slightly throws me off...%K%P

0xCB4
Well, it doesn't matter.%K%N

0xCC0
Anyway, I need to get out of this situation, pronto!%K%P

0xCCC
Makoto「H-Hey... Yuka...」%K%P

0xCE0
Yuka「Oh... S-Sorry...」%K%P

0xCFC
Yuka lets go of me.%K%P

0xD08
Makoto「Now let's get going.」%K%P

0xD14
Once again, we begin walking towards the old well.%K%P

0xD28
... ... ...%K%P

0xD34
—Suddenly!!%K%P

0xD78
The bushes shake violently.%K%N

0xD84
We immediately stand on guard.%K%N

0xD90
Just then, out of the bushes comes...%K A cute puppy.%K%P

0xD9C
Even though... it's just a cute puppy...%K%P

0xDB0
Yuka「KYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0xDBC
... Yuka screams as if she's being murdered.%K%P

0xDD0
And then, it jumps towards me...%K%P

0xDDC
Whoooooooooooooosh!!!%K%P

0xDE8
With all its strength, it wrings my neck.%K%P

0xDF4
Makoto「!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!」%K%P

0xE00
My trachea is crushed, and I can't breathe.%K%N

0xE0C
I do my best to fight it off.%K%P

0xE20
Yuka「D-Damn you! You damned severed head!! I'll punish you%Nso badly so that you'll never come back again!!!」%K%P

0xE2C
(Y-You're... You're wrong... Yuka...)%K%P

0xE38
(That's... not a severed head, it's my head!!)%K%P

0xE44
As I gradually begin to pass out, I desperately try to%Nspeak.%K%N

0xE50
But my voice won't come out...%K%P

0xE98
... Suddenly, my consciousness sinks into darkness...%K%P
