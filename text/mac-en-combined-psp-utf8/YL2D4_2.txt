The preparations are finally in order. Everyone is each%Nholding a paper cup.%K%P

0x80
Inside the cups are ice cold beer. (However, Kurumi and%NHaruka have orange juice.)%K%P

0x8C
Savory smoke begins to rise from the iron plate.%K%P

0xA0
Izumi「Well then, shall we make a toast?」%K%P

0xAC
Izumi「The one to lead off the toast will be... right. Leader of the%NKawashima Party, would you do the honors?」%K%P

0xC8
Yuka「Eheh♪ I thought you'd say that♪」%K%P

0xD4
Everyone's eyes immediately turn to Yuka.%K%P

0xE0
Yuka「Ahem...」%K%P

0xEC
Yuka「Very well then, to our chance meeting...」%K%P

0xF8
Yuka「And it's a little late, but also to Saki's recovery...」%K%P

0x114
Saki「Huh? My... recovery...?」%K%P

0x120
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x12C
Dammit, way to go, Yuka...%K%P

0x148
Yuka「... Yeah. Don't you remember?」%K%P

0x154
Yuka「Weren't you hospitalized for pneumonia once during%Nmiddle school?」%K%P

0x168
Saki「Now that you mention it, that's true...」%K%P

0x17C
Saki「... Hey, isn't it way too late for that!?」%K%P

0x188
Yuka「But it's better late than never, right?」%K%P

0x1A4
Yuka「Anyway, is everyone ready?」%K%P

0x1B0
Yuka「Well then, cheers♪」%K%P

0x1BC
Everyone「Cheers!」%K%P

0x1D0
Well, that was awkward, but at least she was able to pull%Nit off...%K%P

0x274
Everyone is much more cheerful than last time.%K%P

0x280
I can't find one speck of gloom on Saki's expression,%Nand Haruka is in an unusually good mood.%K%P

0x28C
(Ah...)%K%P

0x298
Looking at Haruka jogs my memory.%K%P

0x2A4
Hell's about to break loose any second now...%K%P

0x2B0
...%K%P

0x2BC
Haruka「This...」%K%P

0x2C8
Haruka takes out a plastic bag.%K%P

0x2D4
Inside are some familiar small, living creatures, closely%Npacked and crowded together.%K%P

0x324
Yuka「Ah! There's crabs here♪」%K%P

0x338
As if sensing the event that's about to come, Yuka%Nquickly runs away.%K%P

0x344
I nonchalantly go around Okuhiko and stand behind him.%K%P

0x37C
Kurumi「Haruka-san? What's that?」%K%P

0x388
Kurumi asks innocently.%K%P

0x39C
Haruka「Sea roaches.」%K%P

0x3A8
Okuhiko「Wh-Wh-Wh-What d-do you intend to do with them,%NHaruka-chan?」%K%P

0x3B4
Haruka「Eat them.」%K%P

0x3C0
Okuhiko「... Huh?」%K%P

0x3CC
Izumi「... Huh?」%K%P

0x3D8
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0x3F4
Kurumi「... But they might be surprisingly tasty!」%K%P

0x400
Kurumi mutters this.%K%P

0x40C
Saki「Th-There's no way something like that would be good!」%K%P

0x428
Haruka「... Shall I try grilling them?」%K%P

0x434
Saki「Hey, listen to what people are saying, dammit!」%K%P

0x440
Kurumi「Grill them, grill them, grill the sea roaches♪」%K%P

0x44C
Saki「Don't grill them!」%K%P

0x460
In the time she says that, Haruka has almost finished%Nopening the plastic bag.%K%P

0x46C
I smoothly bind Okuhiko's arms behind his back so he%Ncan't try to run away.%K%P

0x480
Okuhiko「Huh? Ishihara... what are you doing?」%K%P

0x49C
—And in the next instant.%K%P

0x4A8
The opening to the plastic bag opens up, and the large%Ngroup of sea roaches scatter.%K%P

0x4BC
Okuhiko「GWAAAAGH!!!」%K%P

0x4EC
Okuhiko screams...%K%P

0x4F8
Saki and Izumi-san vanish at top speed.%K%P

0x504
Fortunately, none of the sea roaches scatter on top of%Nthe iron plate, and they go every each way...%K%P

0x510
... However, several of them climb up Okuhiko's body.%K%P

0x524
Okuhiko「AAAAAAAAH!!!」%K%P

0x538
Okuhiko「Let me go, Ishihara, let me go, let me go!」%K%P

0x54C
Okuhiko「GAAAAAAAH!!!」%K%P

0x560
Okuhiko「They're getting in my pants, they're getting in my pants,%Nthey're getting in my pants, they're getting in my pants...」%K%P

0x574
Okuhiko「HYAAAAAAAH!!!」%K%P

0x588
Wham...%K%P

0x594
Okuhiko completely faints...%K%P

0x5A0
Soon enough... everyone timidly comes back.%K%P

0x5B4
Haruka「But...」%K%P

0x5C8
Kurumi「... We wanted to eat them.」%K%P

0x5D4
Haruka and Kurumi slump their shoulders in%Ndisappointment...%K%P

0x650
About an hour has passed since then.%K%P

0x65C
The party's in full swing. Due to the sea roach incident,%Nwe've become more lively.%K%P

0x668
Everything is calm as we fool around and poke fun at%Neach other... it's as noisy as ever.%K%P

0x674
I think now's the best time to tell Yuka about my plan for%Nus to "be together with Kurumi all night", so...%K%P

0x688
... I secretly call Yuka over towards the rocks, a short%Ndistance away from the party.%K%P

0x69C
Yuka「Wha ish it, Mako-tan? Doo yuu have shom buishnessh%Nwith me?」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「Yeah, there's something important I have to talk to you%Nabout.」%K%P

0x6B4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x6C0
Makoto「... W-What is it?」%K%P

0x6D4
Yuka「... Lesshee... ish it a confesshun of love?」%K%P

0x6E0
Makoto「I-Idiot, there's no way it'd be that!」%K%P

0x6F4
Yuka「C'mon, Mako-tan♪ If that's it, then yuu shuld hurry up%Nand shay it♪」%K%P

0x700
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x714
Yuka「Mako-tan, the truth ish... I alsho lo...」%K%P

0x730
Huh...?%K%P

0x758
My heart is beating furiously.%K%P

0x76C
Yuka「Kyahahahahahahaha♪」%K%P

0x778
Yuka「That wash a lie, a joke♪」%K%P

0x7A0
Y-You...%K%P

0x7AC
Yuka「I thought it'd be funny if I made a little fun of yuu♪」%K%P

0x7B8
Yuka「Yer sho cute... when yuu look troubled♪」%K%P

0x7C4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x7D8
Yuka「Sho? Whash that shomething important yuu wanted to%Ntalk about?」%K%P

0x7E4
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0x7F8
With a deep sigh, I tell Yuka my plans for Kurumi...%K%P

0x804
...%K%P

0x818
Yuka「I shee. Sho that'sh it...」%K%P

0x824
Makoto「You'll help me, right?」%K%P

0x830
Yuka「Of course!」%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「... Hey, did you really understand a word of what I just%Nsaid now?」%K%P

0x848
Yuka「Geez, ish faine!」%K%P

0x85C
Yuka「Jusht leave it to meee! Nahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x868
Maybe I should have waited until she was sober before%Nbringing this up...%K%P

0x874
That's what I think.%K%P

0x890
—And at that time!%K%P

0x8B8
The sound of water splashing echoes!%K%P

0x8C4
This sound... It's exactly like the one I heard at the last%Nbarbecue.%K%P

0x8D0
I don't need to turn around to understand the situation.%K%P

0x8DC
Saki's hand accidentally slipped, and she spilled the%Nbeer in her paper cup on Yuka.%K%P

0x8E8
—Huh??? ... Yuka???%K%P

0x8F4
But Yuka's in front of me right now, isn't she?%K%P

0x900
(Which means...?)%K%P

0x940
I try slowly turning around...%K%P

0x94C
By the iron plate... Saki is holding a now empty paper cup.%K%P

0x958
And the beer has landed on...%K%P

0x96C
—Kurumi!%K%P

0x978
Kurumi's clothes are soaked from her chest to the%Nbottom of her shirt.%K%P

0x984
(I see...)%K%P

0x990
Because Yuka wasn't in the ring of people, the person%Nwho was next to her originally, Kurumi, was directly hit...%K%P

0x99C
Kurumi「H-Hey, Saki-san...」%K%P

0x9A8
Saki「... S-Sorry.」%K%P

0x9B4
Everyone becomes completely silent.%K%P

0x9C0
Saki「I'm really sorry.」%K%P

0x9CC
... She sounds genuinely apologetic, meaning every word.%K%P

0x9D8
As a further gesture of apology, Saki begins to wipe the%Nbeer off of Kurumi's clothes with a dish cloth.%K%P

0x9E4
Okuhiko doesn't make any stupid jokes, and keeps his%Nmouth shut.%K%P

0x9F0
Naturally, Haruka also stays put, not showing any signs%Nof agitation.%K%P

0x9FC
Just then...%K%P

0xA08
Izumi「Geez, Saki-chan, are you sure you're not drunk?♪」%K%P

0xA14
Okuhiko「Ha ha, that was pretty careless of you, Saki-chan♪」%K%P

0xA20
Haruka「Hee hee hee hee...」%K%P

0xA2C
Saki「Ahahahaha...」%K%P

0xA38
Kurumi「Eheheheh...」%K%P

0xA4C
Everyone「Kyahahahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0xA74
... Everyone bursts into laughter.%K%P

0xA80
They cheerfully laugh at Saki's blunder, as if trying to%Npoke fun at her and brush the incident off.%K%P

0xA8C
Of course, Kurumi's bright smile returns too.%K%P

0xA98
Saki sheepishly grins at all the teasing.%K%P

0xAA4
It's as if... anything and everything's all changed.%K%P

0xAB0
The atmosphere from last time has suddenly changed to%Na harmonious atmosphere.%K%P

0xABC
Why...?%K%P

0xAC8
I don't even have to think about it.%K%P

0xAD4
Once again, a bad history has changed into a good one.%K%P

0xAE0
However, this one is special because history has%Nchanged without us directly interfering with it.%K%P

0xAEC
We didn't think about trying to prevent the fight, but,%Nthankfully, history changed for us.%K%P

0xAF8
This is just like that story, "When the wind blows, the%Nbarrel makers profit."%K%P

0xB04
Could it be that even luck is on our side now?%K%P

0xB10
When I think that, I get into a kinda giddy mood.%K%P

0xB1C
It's a little later... but Yuka and I began to laugh much%Nlouder than the others...%K%P

0xB28
... After that, the laughter doesn't cease until the%Nbarbecue ends...%K%P
