The road to the graveyard appears to be west from%Nhere.%K

0x8C
Well, I say "road," but I doubt you could even call it that.%K%P

0x98
Up until Kurumi told us of its existence, I thought it was%Njust a part of the thicket.%K%P

0xA4
Is there really something like a graveyard at the other%Nend of that thing?%K%P

0xB0
If it really does exist, then it's almost certain that it%Ncould be a dangerous place.%K%P

0xBC
Everyone seemed so enthusiastic and excited about it%Nup until now, but that's all been replaced with nervous%Nanxiety.%K%P

0x190
Only Kurumi seems to be enthusiastic as she leads the%Ngroup into the forest.%K%P

0x19C
Everyone tails closely behind her, as if they were%Nscared of some unknown horror hiding in the bushes.%K%P

0x1A8
Just as I'm about to enter the thicket...%K%P

0x1BC
Kurumi「Ah! Hold on!」%K%P

0x1C8
... Suddenly, our fearless leader Kurumi halts.%K%P

0x1D4
It seems like everyone is about to fall one after the%Nother, but they manage to regain their balance.%K%P

0x1F0
Yuka「G-Geez... what was that all about, Kurumi-chan!?」%K%P

0x204
Kurumi「Sorry, sorry...」%K%P

0x210
Kurumi「You see, it seems like Kurumi forgot something at the%Nlodge.」%K%P

0x224
Yuka「Forgot something?」%K%P

0x230
Kurumi「Yep. So go on ahead, guys!」%K%P

0x244
Yuka「'G-Go on ahead'... you say that, but... Who will... lead us...?」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「I guess I can.」%K%P

0x264
Kurumi「No way! Onii-chan, you're going to go with Kurumi to get%Nwhat she forgot!」%K%P

0x270
It doesn't seem like she's going to let me have a say in%Nthis...%K%P

0x28C
Kurumi「It'll be fine. With the exception of Onii-chan, there's still%None person here reliable enough, right!?」%K%P

0x298
Everyone「...?」%K%P

0x2A4
Kurumi「Will you protect everyone, Okkun?」%K%P

0x2B8
Okuhiko「M-M-M-ME!?」%K%P

0x2C4
Kurumi「You're a guy, so it's only natural, right?」%K%P

0x2D8
...%K%P

0x2E4
In the end, Okuhiko leads the group through the forest%Nas he loudly complains...%K%P

0x350
Kurumi and I have returned to the lodge.%K%P

0x35C
Kurumi looks like she's trying to suppress a mischievous%Ngrin. What's she up to...?%K%P

0x370
Makoto「Hey, Kurumi? What did you forget?」%K%P

0x37C
Kurumi「Kurumi lied♪」%K%P

0x388
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x39C
Kurumi「Kurumi lied about forgetting something♪」%K%P

0x3A8
Makoto「Th-Then why did you have us come back here?」%K%P

0x3B4
Kurumi「Heh heh heh heh heh...」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x3CC
Kurumi「Nahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「That's it, I'm leaving.」%K%P

0x3EC
Kurumi「Hold on!」%K%P

0x3F8
Kurumi firmly grabs my arm and pulls me back.%K%P

0x40C
Kurumi「Now that we're alone, Kurumi will promptly brief you on the%Ndetails of our strategy.」%K%P

0x418
Makoto「Strategy?」%K%P

0x42C
Kurumi「Right, strategy!」%K%P

0x438
Kurumi「Did you know that there are two types of ways to enjoy%Na Test of Courage?」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「No, I didn't.」%K%P

0x458
Kurumi「Huh? Really?」%K%P

0x46C
Kurumi「One: try to get scared to your heart's content.」%K%P

0x478
Kurumi「Two: scare others to their heart's content.」%K%P

0x484
Makoto「Oh, I get it.」%K%P

0x498
Kurumi「Right? And you see, Kurumi was thinking she'd like to fully%Nenjoy it by trying the latter method.」%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「You want to scare the others?」%K%P

0x4B0
Kurumi「Bingo. But in order for the mission to work, Kurumi needs%Na partner in crime.」%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「And for that role, you picked... me?」%K%P

0x4C8
Kurumi「That's right!」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x4E8
Kurumi「Therefore, Kurumi has deducted that step one of the%Noperation is for you and her to become a pair.」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「A pair?」%K%P

0x500
Kurumi「Right! In Tests of Courage, it's a general rule of thumb for%Npeople to be paired up in groups of two, right?」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「Well, that's true.」%K%P

0x518
Kurumi「That's why, when the time comes, Kurumi will suggest,%N'Let's try dividing people into pairs through%NRock-Paper-Scissors!'...」%K%P

0x52C
Kurumi「If we do that and it's your turn for 'Rock, Paper,%NScissors'... use rock, okay?」%K%P

0x538
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x544
Kurumi「Because Kurumi is also going to be using rock.」%K%P

0x550
Makoto「Ah, I see... By doing that, that means as long as we%Ncontinue using rock, no matter how many rounds we go%Nfor, you and I will eventually become a pair?」%K%P

0x564
Kurumi「Well? Don't you think it's a good idea?」%K%P

0x570
Calling it a good idea is a bit of a stretch, but it's pretty%Nsolid...%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「Well then, what's step two?」%K%P

0x590
Kurumi「W-Well...」%K%P

0x5A4
Kurumi「Kurumi will have to wing it once we get there.」%K%P

0x5B0
Makoto「Some plan... you've already hit a dead end.」%K%P

0x5C4
Kurumi「But we need to go, since Kurumi doesn't know what kind%Nof props are lying around.」%K%P

0x5D0
"Props"...?%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「Well, whatever. I understand. So you'll think about it?」%K%P

0x5F0
Kurumi「Yep. Expect an amazing plan♪」%K%P

0x604
Departing with those words, I once again force my way%Nthrough the thicket.%K%P

0x610
Kurumi「W-Wait up〜」%K%P

0x61C
Kurumi jogs right after me.%K%N

0x628
Everyone else has gone so far ahead that we can no%Nlonger see them.%K%P

0x68C
Kurumi「Ta-da♪」%K%P

0x698
Kurumi「Well then, now that we're here, Kurumi will explain the rules.」%K%P

0x6A4
For some reason, Kurumi seems really impatient.%K%N

0x6B0
It feels like she wants to just hurry up and begin.%K%P

0x6BC
Kurumi「According to the Japanese Test of Courage Awareness%NClub Official Rulebook, first edition... 'A Test of Courage is%Na trial held in a scary place to test one's courage.'」%K%P

0x6C8
Kurumi「This time around, the 'scary place' has been decided to%Nbe an old well in the graveyard♪」%K%P

0x6D4
Kurumi「The judge who will see whether or not you make it there,%Nan official referee appointed by the Japanese Test of%NCourage Awareness Club, is none other than I, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x6E0
Makoto「Hey, hey, then you're not participating, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x6F4
Kurumi「That's not true. From the start, she'll be judging the%Nresults of the match!」%K%P

0x700
Makoto「That's unfair, isn't it?」%K%P

0x714
Kurumi「But Kurumi always goes, so it's not scary at all for her♪」%K%P

0x720
Makoto「Well, that's true.」%K%P

0x72C
Kurumi「Besides, it'd be more scary for one of you guys to be%Nwaiting over there by yourself, you know?」%K%P

0x748
Okuhiko「That's also true. Well then, we'll leave it to you,%NKurumi-chan.」%K%P

0x75C
Yuka「All right.」%K%P

0x778
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x78C
Izumi「Geez, do you have to be so self-centered...?」%K%P

0x878
Kurumi「Well then, let's go〜♪」%K%P

0x884
Only Kurumi seems to be enthusiastic as she leads the%Ngroup into the forest.%K%P

0x898
Everyone tails closely behind her, as if they're begging%Nher not to leave them behind.%K%P

0x8A4
Just as I'm about to step into the thicket...%K%P

0x8B0
??「H-Hey... Makoto...」%K%P

0x8BC
... I turn around when someone behind me suddenly calls%Nme.%K%P

0x8D0
Makoto「Yuka... Huh, I thought you were ahead of me...」%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「Aha, lost your nerve?」%K%P

0x8F0
Yuka「N-No way, there's no way... that's it...」%K%P

0x8FC
Makoto「Well then... what is it?」%K%P

0x910
Yuka「R-Right... U-Umm?」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x928
Yuka「So we're really going to do this... Test of Courage?」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x940
Yuka「And... in a Test of Courage... people usually get put into%Npairs... right?」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「Well, that's how it's usually done.」%K%P

0x958
Yuka「B-But you know what? I was thinking a bit...」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x970
Yuka「There's... six of us... aren't there?」%K%P

0x97C
Yuka「And since Kurumi-chan will be the judge, that means%Nthere's essentially five of us, right?」%K%P

0x988
Yuka「Five people... that's an odd number, isn't it?」%K%P

0x994
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Stop stalling and get to the point!」%K%P

0x9A0
Yuka「R-Right... So you know? When it's... time for...%NRock-Paper-Scissors, I'll use rock...」%K%P

0x9AC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x9C0
Yuka「Ma-Makoto, I thought... if you... used... rock... at that time%Nas well... it would be nice...」%K%P

0x9CC
Makoto「... So let's see if I'm thinking what you're thinking.」%K%P

0x9D8
Makoto「When we have to divide into pairs via%NRock-Paper-Scissors, we'll keep using rock. That way, in%Ncase we're divided into pairs of 2-2-1, you won't be the%None all alone, right?」%K%P

0x9E4
Yuka「You... may be right.」%K%P

0x9F0
Makoto「It's not 'may be' right, it is right, isn't it?」%K%P

0x9FC
Yuka「... Y... Yeah.」%K%P

0xA08
Although she hesitates to say this, she gives me a quiet%Nnod.%K%P

0xA14
Makoto「See! You really are scared, aren't you!?」%K%P

0xA28
Yuka「T-T-T-There's no way in hell I'm scared!」%K%P

0xA34
Her tone says otherwise...%K%P

0xA40
Makoto「Ok, I get it, I get it. Well, I'll think about it.」%K%P

0xA54
Yuka「'Think about it'... are you going to or not!?」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「Who knows...?」%K%P

0xA6C
Makoto「Well, it sounds fun, so maybe I'll give it a try.」%K%P

0xA80
Departing with those words, I once again step into the%Nthicket.%K%P

0xA8C
Yuka「W-Wait up〜」%K%P

0xA98
Yuka jogs after me.%K%P

0xB04
??「Hey, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xB10
... I turn around when someone behind me suddenly calls%Nmy name.%K%P

0xB24
Makoto「Izumi-san... is something up?」%K%P

0xB30
Izumi「Y-Yes... Umm?」%K%P

0xB44
Izumi「So we're really going to do this Test of Courage, right?」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0xB5C
Izumi「And in a Test of Courage, people usually get put into%Npairs, right?」%K%P

0xB68
Makoto「Well, that's how it's usually done.」%K%P

0xB74
Izumi「Isn't it? And I think that when we get there, it's likely that%Nwe'll be divided into pairs via Rock-Paper-Scissors...」%K%P

0xB80
Makoto「Right, those who have the same hand become pairs...%Nisn't that right?」%K%P

0xB8C
Izumi「Yes, it is...」%K%P

0xBA0
Izumi「Therefore... I wanted to discuss something with you.」%K%P

0xBAC
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xBB8
Izumi「Makoto-kun, would you use rock during%NRock-Paper-Scissors?」%K%P

0xBC4
Makoto「Wh-What!?」%K%P

0xBD0
Izumi「I'll also use rock like you.」%K%P

0xBDC
Makoto「Huh...? Wait, are you saying...」%K%P

0xBE8
In other words, if we continue to use rock, me and%NIzumi-san will eventually become a pair.%K%P

0xBF4
Izumi「Yes, you seem to have realized it.」%K%P

0xC00
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC0C
I'm at a loss for words.%K%P

0xC18
I don't know what Izumi-san's true intentions are.%K%P

0xC24
Does she think she'll be safer if she's with a guy?%K%P

0xC30
Or could it be...%K%P

0xC3C
That she's taking a proactive motion towards wanting to%Npair up with me?%K%P

0xC50
Izumi「W-Well... if you don't want to, that's fine...」%K%P

0xC5C
Makoto「No, that's not it...」%K%P

0xC68
Izumi「Anyway, I'll be going with rock.」%K%P

0xC7C
Izumi「Makoto-kun... will you think about it?」%K%P

0xC90
Departing with those words, Izumi-san jogs after%Neveryone.%K%P

0xC9C
Makoto「O-Okay...」%K%P

0xCA8
I mumble to myself, bewildered.%K%P

0xCB4
I feel my face grow hot as I try settle my nerves...%K%P

0xCE4
Kurumi「Well then, let's go♪」%K%P

0xCF0
Only Kurumi seems to be enthusiastic as she leads the%Ngroup into the forest.%K%P

0xCFC
Everyone tails closely behind her, as if they're begging%Nher not to leave them behind.%K%P

0xD08
Just as I'm about to step into the thicket...%K%P

0xD14
Someone pokes me from behind. I turn around, and see%Nit's Haruka.%K%P

0xD28
Haruka「Hey, Makoto...」%K%P

0xD34
Haruka「I'll always go with paper...」%K%P

0xD40
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xD4C
Haruka「I won't use anything but paper...」%K%P

0xD58
I don't really get what she's trying to say, but I give her%Na nod as a safe, suitable response.%K%P

0xE08
The graveyard is dimly lit by the pale moon. Half of the%Nmoss-covered tombstones are either half-fallen or%Ncompletely fallen to the ground.%K%P

0xE14
The air is cool and damp, in spite of the relatively warm%Nweather we've had over the past few days.%K%P

0xE28
Kurumi「Did you know? Everyone buried here is a 'muenbotoke',%Nsomeone who died without family or friends to bury them!」%K%P

0xE34
Yuka「Muen... botoke?」%K%P

0xE40
Kurumi「Right. For example, unidentified drowned corpses that%Nwash up on the beach, old-timers with no relatives who%Nhang themselves in the forest...」%K%P

0xE4C
Kurumi「Innocent 'criminals' thrown to the bottom of deep holes%Nwhile still alive... Let's see, what else...」%K%P

0xE58
Yuka「Th-Thanks, Kurumi-chan... That's... enough...」%K%P

0xE6C
The instant we hear, "unidentified drowned corpses", we%Nall instinctively take a half step backwards.%K%P

0xE88
Kurumi「Well then, let's get this show on the road♪」%K%P

0xE94
None of us answer Kurumi, who seems indifferent to our%Nplight.%K%P

0xEA0
Everyone exchanges worried glances with each other.%K%P

0xEAC
"Is it too late to turn back now?" ... is a question we all%Nseem to be asking ourselves.%K%P

0xEC0
Kurumi「Geez, everyone's so scared. It's all right...」%K%P

0xECC
Kurumi「Even if, by any chance, you happen to get possessed%Nby a ghost, Kurumi will refer you to a famous spirit medium!」%K%P

0xED8
Kurumi's "reassurance" only scares us further, clearly%Nher intent.%K%P

0xF10
Kurumi「Well then, let's get right to dividing the pairs through%NRock-Paper-Scissors, okay?」%K%P

0xF1C
Kurumi「If two people have the same hand, those two will become%Na pair.」%K%P

0xF28
Kurumi「But if there are three, four, or five people with the same%Nhand, they have to go through another round.」%K%P

0xF34
Kurumi「Got it?」%K%P

0xF40
Everything's completely going at Kurumi's pace...%K%P

0xF4C
This is no longer a situation we can just back out of%Nanymore.%K%P

0xF58
Makoto「Can't be helped. Well then, let's go.」%K%P

0xFD4
At that instant, Yuka and I make eye contact.%K%P

0x1078
Kurumi「Ah... For now, one pair has been decided, Onii-chan and%NYuka-san.」%K%P

Although I feel a little guilty, I avoid her glance and check%Nthe others' hands.%K%P

0x1600
Haruka has rock, and Okuhiko also has rock...%K%N

0x1614
And like me, Yuka has paper.%K%P

0x1620
Kurumi「Well then, it's time for another round for, Haruka-san,%NOkkun, and Onee-chan.」%K%P

0x1644
Yuka has rock, Okuhiko has rock...%K%N

0x1658
And like me, Haruka also has paper.%K%P

0x1664
Kurumi「Well then, this time around, Yuka-san, Okkun, and%NOnee-chan can only use rock or paper, okay?」%K%P

0x1680
In that instant, Haruka and I make eye contact.%K%P

0x1694
Kurumi「Ready, Set! Rock, Paper, Scissors...」%K

0x40E8
Rock!

0x40F4
Scissors!

0x4100
Paper!

0x16E4
Kurumi「... Go!」%K%P

0x16F0
Everyone releases their hands simultaneously.%K%N

0x16FC
True to her word, Haruka releases her stretched out%Npalm for paper.%K%P

0x1710
When I release rock, Haruka throws a slightly lonely%Nglance at me.%K%P

0x171C
(I feel kinda bad for turning her down...)%K%P

0x1728
Although I feel a little guilty, I avoid her glance and check%Nthe others' hands.%K%P

0x1784
Yuka has paper, and Okuhiko also has paper...%K%N

0x17A0
And like me, Izumi-san has rock.%K%P

0x17AC
Kurumi「Well then, it's time for another round where Okkun,%NYuka-san, and Haruka-san can only use rock or paper,%Nokay?」%K%P

0x17D8
Izumi-san has paper, and Okuhiko also has paper...%K%N

0x17EC
And like me, Yuka has rock.%K%P

0x17F8
Kurumi「Well then, it's time for another round for, Haruka-san,%NOkkun, and Onee-chan.」%K%P

0x1814
Kurumi「... Go!」%K%P

0x1820
Everyone releases their hands simultaneously.%K%N

True to her word, Haruka releases her stretched out%Npalm for paper.%K%P

0x1840

Kurumi「Well then, it's time for another round where Okkun,%NYuka-san, and Haruka-san can only use rock or paper,%Nokay?」%K%P

0x1908
Izumi-san has paper, and Okuhiko also has paper...%K%N

Kurumi「Well then, it's time for another round for, Haruka-san,%NOkkun, and Onee-chan.」%K%P

0x1954
Makoto「... Go!」%K%P

0x1960
Everyone releases their hands simultaneously.%K%P

0x196C
I have paper, Yuka has rock, Izumi-san has rock, and%NOkuhiko also has rock...%K%N

0x1980
... Just as she had planned earlier, Haruka releases%Npaper.%K%P

0x198C
Kurumi「Ah... For now, one pair has been decided, Haruka-san%Nand Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x19A0
Haruka looks towards me and mouths a silent, "thank%Nyou."%K%P

0x19AC
Kurumi「Well then, this time around, Yuka-san, Okkun, and%NOnee-chan can only use rock or paper, okay?」%K%P

0x19F4
Okuhiko「Huh? Why's that? Can't we just form a group of three?」%K%P

0x1A2C
Kurumi「Bzzt Bzzt! Wrongamundo!」%K%P

0x1A38
Kurumi「According to the Japanese Test of Courage Awareness%NClub Rulebook, this year's Edition... 'During a Test of%NCourage, there may only be groups of one or two'...%Nthat's how it is.」%K%P

0x1A4C
Okuhiko「Y-You've gotta be kidding me...」%K%P

0x1A58
Kurumi「Ready, Set! Rock, Paper, Scissors...」%K%P

0x1A6C
Okuhiko「Go...」%K%P

0x1A80
Okuhiko「... Dammit, why did I pick that one!?」%K%P

0x1A8C
When I quickly peep into the ring of three hands, I see%Nthat while Okuhiko picked rock, the other two picked%Npaper.%K%P

0x1AA0
Kurumi「So in conclusion, we have our pairs. Kurumi will now%Nexplain the rest of the rules♪」%K%P

0x1AAC
Okuhiko dejectedly sits down on a nearby tombstone...%K%P

0x1B40
Yuka seems to be relieved, as if she's saying "I'm so%Nglad I'm not alone." She takes a deep breath, and sighs...%K%P

0x1B54
Yuka seems to be relieved, as if she's saying "I'm so%Nglad I'm not alone." She takes a deep breath, and sighs...%K%P

0x1B68
Yuka seems to be relieved, as if she's saying "I'm so%Nglad I'm not alone." She takes a deep breath, and sighs...%K%P

0x1BD4
Kurumi lays out the rules.%K%P

0x1BE0
"There's an old well somewhere in this graveyard. Two of%Nyou will team up to look for it."%K%P

0x1BEC
"If you find it, sign your names on the wall of the well with%Na pebble as proof."%K%P

0x1BF8
"If you can do that, you can return to the start point."%K%P

0x1C04
It was decided that we should play%NRock-Paper-Scissors to pick a representative to%Nchoose which pair goes first.%K%P

0x1C10
They would also decide when the next pair will leave ten%Nminutes after the first.%K%P

0x1C1C
Incidentally, I won the match.%K%P

0x1C28
When I heard that I could pick whatever order I liked, I%Nimmediately picked to go first, since I wanted to get this%Nover with.%K%P

0x1C34
Though I guess now that I think about it, it doesn't really%Nmatter if I go first or last...%K%P

0x1CF0
Yuka, on the other hand, thinks otherwise...%K%P

0x1CFC
Yuka「What possessed you to make us go first!?」%K%P

0x1D08
... She's not joking, she's seriously angry.%K%P

0x1D14
Makoto「Well then, would you have preferred to go last?」%K%P

0x1D28
Yuka「That's out of the question! Normally, you'd pick to go in%Nthe middle, right!?」%K%P

0x1D4C
Yuka「Haah... I was an idiot to team up with you, Makoto...」%K%P

0x1D58
Makoto「Hey, hey, how about a little gratitude?」%K%P

0x1D64
Makoto「If I had picked paper, you would have ended up%Nwandering around this graveyard all alone, wouldn't you?」%K%P

0x1D70
Yuka「If I were picking, I'd prefer to be alone and in the middle...」%K%P

0x1D7C
Makoto「... Geez... Listen to yourself.」%K%P

0x1D90
Makoto「Huh? Are you... are you scared?」%K%P

0x1DA4
Yuka「Th-Th-Th-There's no way that I'm sc-scared!」%K%P

0x1DB0
Her tone completely betrays her words...%K%P

0x1DE8
Just how long has it been since we started walking?%K%P

0x1DF4
We've taken countless turns, and we already lost sight%Nof the others a long time ago.%K%P

0x1E00
It's difficult to find the well in this darkness.%K%P

0x1E0C
To think I thought this was going to be easy...%K%P

0x1E50
—Suddenly,the sound of rustling leaves comes from%Nthe bushes between the tombstones.%K%P

0x1E5C
Yuka「H-hey, Makoto... Did you... hear something just now?」%K%P

0x1E68
Makoto「It's probably just the wind.」%K%P

0x1E74
Yuka「Y-You think so?」%K%P

0x1E9C
Yuka「L-Listen! There really is something here!」%K%P

0x1EA8
Makoto「It's all right.」%K%P

0x1EB4
Yuka「It's NOT all right!」%K%P

0x1EC0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1EDC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1EE8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1EF4
Yuka「H-Hey... why aren't you saying anything?」%K%P

0x1F00
Makoto「'Why'...? Is this even the time to be chatting?」%K%P

0x1F0C
Yuka「Don't just ignore me!」%K%P

0x1F34
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1F40
Yuka「Say something!」%K%P

0x1F4C
Makoto「Something...? Like what?」%K%P

0x1F58
Yuka「Anything's fine! It doesn't matter, just talk about%Nsomething cheerful!」%K%P

0x1F64
Makoto「Something cheerful, huh...?」%K

0x410C
Talk about the latest idol.

0x4118
Talk about a rumor from college.

0x1FA4
Makoto「Oh, I know!」%K%P

0x1FB0
Makoto「Recently, there was this idol who hung herself in her own%Napartment... umm, what was her name again...」%K%P

0x1FC4
Makoto「Oh, I know!」%K%P

0x1FD0
Makoto「Recently, I heard that there was this student at our%Ncollege who hung himself in the auditorium... um, what%Ndepartment were they from again...」%K%P

0x1FDC
Yuka「S-Sorry. Maybe you shouldn't talk.」%K%P

0x1FE8
Makoto「What? Didn't you want me to?」%K%P

0x1FF4
Yuka「It's fine, just be quiet!」%K%P

0x202C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2038
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2044
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2050
Yuka「I can't take it! Talk to me!」%K%P

0x205C
Makoto「Y-You...」%K%P

0x2068
Yuka「B-But, could you talk about something else?」%K%P

0x2074
Makoto「I don't have any other stories.」%K%P

0x2080
Yuka「Well then... could you sing a song?」%K%P

0x208C
Makoto「A song?」%K%P

0x2098
Yuka「Do you think you can sing something cheerful?」%K%P

0x20A4
Makoto「A cheerful song...」%K

0x4124
"Requiem for the Grim Reaper."

0x4130
"I Love Dolls♪"

0x20E4
Makoto「Fresh blood dripping in the twilight〜♪」%K%P

0x20F0
Makoto「He'll cut your head off with his scythe〜♪」%K%P

0x2104
Makoto「I love dolls, papapaya-♪」%K%P

0x2110
Makoto「My favorite straw doll-♪ Carrying a mallet in one hand%Nand nails in the other-♪」%K%P

0x211C
Makoto「It'll curse that guy I hate most-♪ I'll try to kill him with that%Ncurse-♪」%K%P

0x2128
Yuka「H-how was that cheerful!?」%K%P

0x2134
Makoto「Idiot! If you'd have listened to the whole thing, you'd%Nhave known it gets more cheerful after that!」%K%P

0x2140
Yuka「Enough!」%K%P

0x214C
Yuka「Haah... Geez...」%K%P

0x2158
Yuka lets out a weary sigh.%K%P

0x21D4
I check my watch to find that it's past 9:00.%K%N

0x21E0
Everyone's gone off to look for the well by now.%K%N

0x21EC
If that's true, then why can't I hear their voices or their%Nfootsteps?%K%P

0x21F8
It's possible that they might have already reached the%Ngoal.%K%P

0x2204
Kurumi and Izumi-san probably know where the well is...%K%N

0x2210
If that's the case, then we're probably headed the%Nwrong way.%K%P

0x221C
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Why don't we just head back to the starting%Npoint?」%K%P

0x2228
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x2234
Makoto「I think we're going the wrong way... The well might be in%Nanother direction...」%K%P

0x2240
Yuka「R-Right... Okay...」%K%P

0x224C
Thus we head back the way we came.%K%P

0x2258
Actually, since we took so many turns, I can't really tell if%Nwe are going the right way or not.%K%P

0x2264
(We're not... lost, are we?)%K%P

0x2270
Even though this Test of Courage doesn't scare me like%Nit does Yuka, it's not like I don't feel discouraged by this%Nturn of events.%K%P

0x227C
The lingering clouds slowly cover the moon.%K%N

0x2288
Before I realize it, the darkness around me has grown%Nthicker...%K%N

0x2294
—And, at that time!%K%P

0x22F4
Once again, I hear something moving in the grass.%K%P

0x2300
Yuka「A-Again...?」%K%P

0x230C
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x2318
Yuka「Hey? Doesn't it feel like... that ever since earlier...%Nsomeone's been following us?」%K%P

0x2324
Makoto「Following us?」%K%P

0x2330
Yuka「It feels like someone... is watching us...」%K%P

0x233C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2348
I can't just laugh off what she said.%K%N

0x2354
It does feel like a pair of mysterious and cold eyes are%Nspying at us from the bushes in the shadow of the%Ntombstones.%K%P

0x2360
... Suddenly, a moist breeze gently strokes the back of%Nmy neck.%K%N

0x236C
It's like the warm sigh of a living human.%K%P

0x23A4
Yuka「H-Hey... Makoto?」%K%P

0x23B0
Yuka「U-Um, can I ask you something?」%K%P

0x23BC
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x23C8
Yuka「Could you... hold my hand?」%K%P

0x23D4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x23E0
Yuka「It's not like I mean anything by it, but...」%K

0x413C
Silently hold out my hand.

0x4148
Silently take Yuka's hand.

0x4154
Refuse.

0x2438
I silently hold out my hand.%K%P

0x244C
Yuka hesitates before slowly reaching for my open palm.%K%P

0x2470
I silently take Yuka's hand.%K%P

0x247C
Her arm trembles the moment I touch her.%K%P

0x2490
Makoto「No way!」%K%P

0x249C
I can't help but exclaim this.%K%P

0x24A8
Makoto「Didn't you say you weren't scared?」%K%P

0x24B4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x24C0
Surprisingly, Yuka doesn't object.%K%N

0x24CC
I guess she can't even try to talk tough here.%K%P

0x24E0
Just then, Yuka suddenly—no, it's sudden, but it also%Nfeels natural, as if it were a completely normal%Naction—takes my hand.%K%P

0x24FC
Her hand is very soft.%K%N

0x2508
It's damp with sweat... but faintly warm...%K%N

0x2514
... And it's shaking slightly.%K%P

0x2520
Her hand brushes against mine, tickling my palm.%K%P

0x252C
I realize in alarm that my heart is pounding violently.%K%N

0x2538
She's not the one who's trembling; I am...%K%P

0x25A4
We've been holding hands for the past ten minutes.%K%N

0x25B0
We walk and walk, but we still can't find the well.%K%P

0x25BC
(Have we been duped?)%K%P

0x25C8
(Maybe there was no well from the start...)%K%P

0x25D4
... My doubt steadily grows.%K%P

0x25E0
Maybe the truth is that the others sent us out before%Nreturning to the lodge. Perhaps they're all relaxing right%Nnow in the living room, watching TV.%K%P

0x25EC
Okuhiko「Heh heh heh... They completely bought it!」%K%P

0x25F8
(Okuhiko would say something like that...)%K%P

0x2604
Before long... the clouds in the sky part, and the moon%Nreappears.%K%N

0x2610
The moon's light dispels the darkness we'd been walking%Nthrough.%K%P

0x261C
Thanks to that, we can now clearly see our surroundings.%K%N

0x2628
As my eyes adjust...%K%P

0x2634
Yuka「Ah! Found it!」%K%P

0x2640
... Yuka begins to drag me to whatever it is she has%Ndiscovered.%K%P

0x264C
Makoto「F-Found it... Found what?」%K%P

0x2680
Yuka「This!」%K%P

0x268C
Yuka stops, and in front of her lies our target—the%Nwell.%K%N

0x2698
Her face was stiff with fear a few moments ago, but now%Na broad grin is stretched across her face.%K%P

0x26A4
Her delight at finding the well has overshadowed her%Nprevious fear.%K%P

0x26B0
Yuka「Well then, let's just get this over with right away so we%Ncan go back.」%K%P

0x26C4
Yuka bends over, and begins to look for a small pebble%Nin order to carve her name into the well.%K%P

0x26D0
Yuka「I can't find anything to carve with...」%K%P

0x26DC
With her hands on her knees, Yuka takes two steps%Naway from me.%K%P

0x26E8
I'm starting to grow uneasy.%K%N

0x26F4
My intuition is telling me that something is wrong.%K%P

0x2700
How is it that only the area around the well got this clean%Nwhen the rest of the graveyard is like a ruin?%K%P

0x270C
Even though this is a place where it wouldn't be%Nunnatural to find a pebble or two on the ground, there%Nare trees; there ought to be fallen branches.%K%P

0x2718
—An old graveyard and an old well.%K%N

0x2724
For some reason, I remember Kurumi's words from just%Nbefore we left...%K%P

0x2740
"Or innocent 'criminals' who were thrown to the bottom of%Na deep hole while they were still alive."%K%P

0x274C
(A deep hole?)%K%P

0x2758
(Could it be...?)%K%P

0x2780
The bushes shake.%K%N

0x2794
Yuka freezes.%K%N

0x27A0
Our eyes peel onto the bushes as we listen warily.%K%P

0x27C8
Whatever it is, it's in front of Yuka.%K%N

0x27D4
There's definitely something lurking in the overgrown%Nbushes.%K%P

0x27E0
Makoto「... Yuka.」%K%P

0x27EC
I whisper hoarsely.%K%P

0x27F8
Makoto「Walk towards me... slowly.」%K%P

0x2804
However, Yuka is frozen in fear.%K%P

0x2810
The tension in the air is like a strung up string...%K%N

0x281C
Shivers run up my spine...%K%P

0x2860
??「WAH!!!」%K%P

0x286C
Suddenly, a white, freshly severed head appears out of%Nthe bushes.%K%P

0x2878
The stiff, bent over Yuka...%K%N

0x2884
... slowly raises her head...%K%N

0x2890
... and looks at it. In that instant...!%K%P

0x28B4
Yuka「KYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0x28C0
... Her agonized scream is piercing, like that of a dying%Nperson.%K%P

0x28CC
A flashlight from underneath the severed head's chin is%Nthen turned off...%K%P

0x2904
Kurumi「Were you surprised? Were you surprised?」%K%P

0x2910
... and Kurumi gleefully asks this.%K

0x4160
"A little."

0x416C
"I'm not a kid, you know."

0x2958
Makoto「A little...」%K%P

0x2964
I decide to pretend to be a little surprised after seeing%Nhow delighted Kurumi was.%K%P

0x2970
Of course, I had a hunch that this was going to happen...%K%P

0x297C
Makoto「I'm fine, but I think Yuka soiled herself...」%K%P

0x2988
I glance towards Yuka.%K%P

0x2994
Right now, she is standing completely still in a daze, like%Na deer in the headlights.%K%P

0x29A8
I figured that something like this was going to happen.%K%P

0x29B4
Makoto「I'm not a kid, so there's no way such worn out tricks will%Nwork.」%K%P

0x29C0
I tell Kurumi this.%K%P

0x29CC
However, out of the corner of my eye, I see Yuka%Nstanding completely still.%K%P

0x29D8
Makoto「Well, that's more than I can say for her.」%K%P

0x29E4
I add.%K%P

0x29F0
Kurumi「Teehee♪ Sorry, Yuka-san.」%K%P

0x2A04
Yuka「... Ku... Kurumi... chan...」%K%P

0x2A10
Yuka「... Wh... Why... is Kurumi... chan...?」%K%P

0x2A1C
She still doesn't seem to understand what's going on.%K%P

0x2A30
Yuka「Ah!」%K%P

0x2A3C
She's finally snapped out of it...%K%P

0x2A48
Yuka「K-Kurumi-chan! H-Hurry, we've got to get out of here!」%K%P

0x2A5C
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x2A68
Yuka「Th-Th-Th-There's a possessed head!」%K%P

0x2A74
Guess I spoke too soon...%K%P

0x2A88
Kurumi「Kyahahahahahahaha♪ Geez, Yuka-san, you're the%Ngreatest!」%K%P

0x2A94
Kurumi is delighted for having scared Yuka so much.%K%P

0x2AA0
—However!!%K%P

0x2AE4
For some reason, the bushes rustle again...%K%N

0x2AF0
It's from a different place than where Kurumi was hiding.%K%P

0x2AFC
Makoto「... Ha ha, I see. Who's your accomplice?」%K%P

0x2B08
Makoto「The first time was for your entrance, so this one... must%Nbe your partner?」%K%P

0x2B1C
Kurumi「Huh...?」%K%P

0x2B28
Kurumi mutters this and shakes her head slowly in denial.%K%P

0x2B34
Makoto「I-I'm wrong? ... Then what was that sound?」%K%P

0x2B48
Yuka「Geez, what are you saying, Makoto!?」%K%P

0x2B54
Yuka「Didn't you see it earlier? That possessed head!?」%K%P

0x2B60
I'll just ignore Yuka for now...%K%P

0x2B6C
Makoto「Say, Kurumi? Can I ask you one thing?」%K%P

0x2B80
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x2B8C
Makoto「Kurumi... have you been hiding here since the start of%Nthe Test of Courage?」%K%P

0x2B98
Kurumi「Y-Yeah. That's right.」%K%P

0x2BA4
Makoto「Which means that you weren't following us, were you...?」%K%P

0x2BB0
Kurumi「Sh-She never did that.」%K%P

0x2BBC
Kurumi「Kurumi's been here this whole time.」%K%P

0x2BC8
She's turned ghastly pale.%K%P

0x2BD4
Judging by her expression, I don't think she's lying.%K%P

0x2BE8
When Yuka hears this, her lips go white again, and her%Nthin shoulders slowly start shaking.%K%P

0x2BF4
Her eyes widen and she looks so frightened that it%Nseems she'll burst into tears any moment.%K%P

0x2C1C
The leaves shake violently.%K%P

0x2C28
We all immediately stand on guard.%K%P

0x2C34
I gulp, and try to focus my eyes in the darkness...%K%P

0x2C70
Soon enough...%K%P

0x2C98
... A small head sticks itself out of the base of the%Nbushes.%K%N

0x2CA4
... It's covered in fur.%K%N

0x2CB0
... Fur?%K%P

0x2CD8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2CE4
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x2CF8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2D04
Makoto「I-It's a dog...」%K%P

0x2D34
Kurumi「How cute♪」%K%P

0x2D40
Kurumi「It's a puppy, a puppy!」%K%P

0x2D4C
Kurumi shouts in delight.%K%P

0x2D58
The puppy, however...%K%P

0x2DAC
... barks once, then runs back into the bushes.%K%P

0x2DB8
Kurumi「Ah, hey! Wait!」%K%P

0x2DCC
Kurumi chases after it, and suddenly disappears into%Nthe bushes.%K%P

0x2DD8
Yuka and I are left behind, and we listen to the sound of%Nthe two of them steadily getting farther away in%Ndumbfoundment.%K%P

0x2DE4
Makoto「Why was there... a puppy here of all places?」%K%P

0x2DF0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2DFC
Makoto「H-Huh? Yuka?」%K%P

0x2E08
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2E14
Makoto「Hey!」%K%P

0x2E28
I wave my hand in front of Yuka.%K%P

0x2E34
I wave it three more times, but she doesn't even blink.%K%P

0x2E40
Yuka「H-H-H-H-H-H-H...」%K%P

0x2E4C
Yuka「H-Head, head, head...」%K%P

0x2E58
No good... she's completely gone...%K%P

0x2E64
Yuka「One head... two heads...」%K%P

0x2E70
Makoto「Haah... Oh brother...」%K%P

0x2EA0
—After that, I drag Yuka back towards the the lodge%Nas she continues rambling incoherently, like a drunk%Nmiddle-aged salaryman...%K%P

0x2F14
Kurumi「Well then, Group #1, heading out!♪」%K%P

0x2F20
Kurumi, in high spirits, grabs my hand and runs ahead.%K%P

0x2F7C
Kurumi「Good work.」%K%P

0x2F88
Makoto「Thanks... well then, what will we do?」%K%P

0x2F9C
Kurumi「About what?」%K%P

0x2FA8
Makoto「About the plan.」%K%P

0x2FBC
Kurumi「Truth is...」%K%P

0x2FC8
Kurumi takes various things out from a pouch she%Nsecretly had.%K%P

0x2FDC
Kurumi「Ta-da!!」%K%P

0x2FE8
She takes out a flashlight, string, a scary mask, and...%Nkonnyaku...?%K%P

0x2FF4
Makoto「Konnyaku?」%K%P

0x3000
Makoto「Just when did you get all of these things ready?」%K%P

0x300C
Kurumi「Heh heh, what do you think? It's KuruKuru Kurumi Magic♪」%K%P

0x3018
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x305C
Makoto「So what's the plan?」%K%P

0x3068
Kurumi「First, Kurumi will hide the mask in the well♪」%K%P

0x3074
Makoto「I see, and then?」%K%P

0x3080
Kurumi「Then if someone comes, we'll shine the light from below...%NOoooooo-boooooo, woooooo...」%K%P

0x308C
Makoto「Oh ho, and then?」%K%P

0x3098
Kurumi「In that instant, Onii-chan-」%K%P

0x30A4
Makoto「Me?」%K%P

0x30B0
Kurumi「You'll scare them from behind!」%K%P

0x30BC
Makoto「How so?」%K%P

0x30C8
Kurumi「By using the konnyaku and dripping it on their neck!」%K%P

0x30D4
Makoto「Drip it?」%K%P

0x30E0
Kurumi「It's called... The Scary Mask and Cold Dripping Konnyaku%NThat's As Effective As A Diet Strategy♪」%K%P

0x30EC
Makoto「Damn, that's a long name.」%K%P

0x30F8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3104
Makoto「But how am I supposed to sneak up on them?」%K%P

0x3110
Makoto「If they turn around when I'm holding the konnyaku, I'll just%Nlook like an idiot!」%K%P

0x311C
Kurumi「Heh heh, that's what the string's for!」%K%P

0x3128
Makoto「Oh ho.」%K%P

0x3134
Kurumi「Onii-chan, find a branch nearby and tie the string to it to%Nhang the konnyaku up!」%K%P

0x3140
Kurumi「And then, hide in a nearby bush, and then from there, do%Nit... Afterwards, that person will...」%K%P

0x314C
Kurumi「They'll shake in fear, scream in agony, and horribly sully%Nthemselves...」%K%P

0x3158
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3164
Kurumi「Kurumi'll call it...」%K%P

0x3170
Makoto「That's enough!!」%K%P

0x3184
Kurumi「Oh come on! Kurumi spent months perfecting this plan!」%K%P

0x3190
Makoto「Liar!」%K%P

0x31A4
Kurumi「But it's a good plan, right?」%K%P

0x31B0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x31BC
How should I answer?%K

0x4178
It's pretty good.

0x4184
It's mere child's play.

0x3204
Makoto「Well, it's pretty good.」%K%P

0x3210
Makoto「If it's Yuka, she'll be pissing herself.」%K%P

0x321C
Kurumi「Right, right!」%K%P

0x3228
Makoto「You've just gained a ton of points in my book!」%K%P

0x3234
Kurumi「Really?♪」%K%P

0x3240
Makoto「Yeah, really.」%K%P

0x324C
Kurumi「Really?♪」%K%P

0x3258
Makoto「Really.」%K%P

0x3264
Kurumi「Then how about a reward!?」%K%P

0x3270
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x327C
Kurumi「A re-war-d♪」%K%P

0x3288
Makoto「Um... what kind of reward?」%K%P

0x3294
Kurumi「Think of it yourself!」%K%P

0x32A0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x32AC
Makoto「Got it. You're such a good girl...」%K%P

0x32B8
I pet Kurumi's head, like a puppy.%K%P

0x32CC
Kurumi「Ah, geez, don't treat Kurumi like a kid...」%K%P

0x32D8
Makoto「Doesn't this sort of thing make you happy?」%K%P

0x32E4
Kurumi「It doesn't!!」%K%P

0x32F0
Makoto「Then what would make you happy?」%K%P

0x32FC
Kurumi「Well, umm-」%K%P

0x3310
Makoto「It's mere child's play.」%K%P

0x3324
Kurumi「Hey! Well then, do you have any better ideas?」%K%P

0x3330
Makoto「Huh? Hmm...」%K%P

0x333C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3348
Kurumi「Don't ridicule Kurumi's plan if you can't think of anything%Nyourself.」%K%P

0x3354
Makoto「Hey, I'm still capable of cooking something up.」%K%P

0x3360
Kurumi「Then think of something better.」%K%P

0x336C
Makoto「S-Sure.」%K%P

0x3378
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3384
Makoto「Well, if we use this konyakku...」%K%P

0x3390
Kurumi「If we use the konyakku?」%K%P

0x339C
(Crap, I've got to think of something...)%K%P

0x33A8
Makoto「Ummmm-」%K%P

0x33B4
Kurumi「What do you-」%K%P

0x33C0
??「Oh, found it!!」%K%P

0x3400
Kurumi「AHHHHHHHH!!」%K%P

0x341C
Yuka「It was really loud over here, so I found it quickly.」%K%P

0x3428
Makoto「Dammit!!」%K%P

0x343C
Kurumi「Geeeeeeeeez, Onii-chan... YOU IDIOOOOOOOOOOT!!」%K%P

0x3448
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x34D8
The stone pavement is pleasantly cool. A breeze stirs%Nthe nearby trees, making me somehow uneasy.%K%P

0x34E4
Kurumi said that almost everyone buried in this group of%Nmoss-covered tombstones are muenbotoke. I%Nabsolutely don't believe in ghosts or monsters, but%Nbeing here is making me feel strangely insecure.%K%P

0x34F8
Haruka, who's walking alongside me with her usual stony%Nface, is completely unfazed by this atmosphere. Doesn't%Nshe have an imagination?%K%P

0x3504
Makoto「Kurumi sure knows this place well. Now that I think about it,%Nshe did say earlier that everyone buried here is a%Nmuenbotoke...」%K%P

0x3510
The silence is killing me. Sheesh, we shouldn't have done%Nthis Test of Courage.%K%P

0x351C
Haruka「'Muenbotoke'?」%K%P

0x3528
Makoto「You don't know? When someone dies and they have no%Nfamily or relatives to bury them, they become muenbotoke.%K%PSee, you write the word with the characters 'nothing' (無),%N'relationship' (縁), and 'deceased' (仏)... a dead person%Nwith no relationships.」%K%P

0x3534
Haruka「No 'relationships'...」%K%P

0x3540
Makoto「It sounds very lonely, dying without having a person%Nwho cares about you.」%K%P

0x3554
Haruka「When I die, it's likely that nobody will care either...」%K%P

0x3560
Makoto「Haruka... what are you saying?」%K%P

0x356C
Haruka「It's because I'm just someone's replacement... because%NI'm nothing more than a copy...」%K%P

0x3578
Makoto「Haruka... I won't forgive her for talking about you that way.」%K%P

0x3584
Haruka「...?」%K%P

0x3590
Makoto「I mean Saki. What gives her the idea that she has the%Nright to look down on you like that? That's not right.」%K%P

0x35A4
Haruka「Do you really think that?」%K%P

0x35B0
Makoto「Yeah. It pisses me off when I think about the incident at%Nthe ocean yesterday, as well as what happened today...%NBut how did she know that you're a clone in the first%Nplace?」%K%P

0x35BC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x35C8
Makoto「Did something happen between you and Saki? Was the%Nday before yesterday not the first time you had met?」%K%P

0x35D4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x35E0
Haruka begins to step away from me. She moves to a%Nstone paving by a large, conspicuous tombstone.%K%P

0x35EC
Haruka's face says, "I don't want to talk about Saki."%NIgnoring this, I step towards her. I'm partly surprised that%NI can read emotions off of Haruka's face...%K%P

0x35F8
Makoto「It wasn't, was it?」%K%P

0x3604
A sudden gust of wind passes by, making the trees%Nsound like they're in an uproar.%K%P

0x3610
CRASH! I slip on the stone paving. I catch my breath and%Nlook at Haruka.%K%P

0x3634
Haruka's eyes are shining with curiosity. She squats%Ndown and begins to crawl.%K%P

0x3640
Makoto「Stop... stop acting so creepy. Come on, get up...」%K%P

0x364C
Haruka pays no heed to my words, and I hear the sound%Nof scraping against the stone pavement.%K%PIt's completely dark; I can't see a thing. This is what they%Ncall true darkness.%K%P

0x3658
I immediately spring to my feet. I would try to run away,%Nbut Haruka grabs one of my ankles before I can do so.%K%P

0x366C
Haruka「She stole from me.」%K%P

0x3678
Makoto「Stole?」%K%P

0x3684
Haruka still clings to my leg as she says this.%K%P

0x3690
Haruka「It wasn't just that day... she stole from me again...」%K%P

0x369C
Makoto「What? What did she steal from you?」%K%P

0x36A8
Haruka「My...」%K%P

0x36B4
—Then, at that time.%K%P

0x36C8
??「KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0x36F0
Haruka and I turn around upon hearing this bloodcurdling%Nscream from behind us.%K%P

0x36FC
??「WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!」%K%P

0x3708
As the crying gets louder, we see a black shadow%Nrunning towards us with great speed...%K%P

0x371C
... It's Yuka.%K%P

0x3728
Makoto「Wh-What's wrong, Yuka!?」%K%P

0x3734
Yuka「H-H-H-H-H-H...」%K%P

0x3740
Makoto「Calm down!」%K%P

0x374C
I firmly grasp Yuka's shoulders, and calm her down.%K%P

0x3760
Yuka「H-He-Head-Head...」%K%P

0x376C
Makoto「Head??」%K%P

0x3778
Soon enough...%K%P

0x3794
Izumi「Haah, haah... Geez, don't go running off without a word,%NYuka-chan!」%K%P

0x37A0
... Izumi, who was paired with Yuka, comes up to us, quite%Nout of breath.%K%P

0x37AC
Izumi「That was a dog! ... It was just a puppy sticking its head%Nout of the bushes!」%K%P

0x37B8
A puppy...? To think there'd be a puppy in this%Ngraveyard...%K%P

0x37C4
... Wait a minute, that's what scared Yuka...!?%K%P
