Suddenly, I hear the sound of a ringing bell in the%Ndarkness...%K%P

0x17C
I fall out of my bed as I try to jump out of it.%K%P

0x188
It's the exact same sound from my hopeless dream...%K%P

0x194
My heart pounds violently.%K%P

0x1A0
The sound of the bell definitely came from the living room.%K%P

0x1AC
Despite my body feeling sluggish, I force myself up and%Nrun towards the living room.%K%P

0x1E4
The room is pitch black. It's impossible to see anything.%K%P

0x20C
I hear the faint sound of the bell again...%K%P

0x218
And at the same time, I hear the sound of tapping%Nfootsteps running down the short staircase on the%Nterrace.%K%P

0x224
—It's coming from outside!%K%P

0x230
I immediately open the front door.%K%P

0x2AC
It's pouring rain outside.%K%P

0x2C4
I rush down the short staircase and plunge into the%Ndownpour.%K%P

0x2D0
Near the entrance of the forest path, I see two bright%Nred lights.%K%P

0x2DC
It's the tail lights of a car.%K%P

0x2E8
I see a shadow running towards the car...%K%P

0x2F4
The shadow has a ponytail that sways with the rain.%K%P

0x300
—Saki!?%K%P

0x328
... The car's door slams shut.%K%P

0x334
The headlights turn on, illuminating the countless falling%Nraindrops in the darkness.%K%P

0x340
When I look closely I see that the car has a white sphere%Nshaped object on its roof, an object I've seen before%Non certain cars in cities.%K%P

0x34C
It seems that it's a taxi.%K%P

0x358
Vroom... the taxi starts driving away in unison with the%Nsound of exhaust coming from its pipe.%K%P

0x380
The bright red tail lights of the taxi get farther and%Nfarther away, and the sound of the tires driving on%Ngravel is eventually drowned away by the rain...%K%P

0x38C
(That was... that was definitely Saki...)%K%P

0x398
What was she doing at the lodge in the middle of the%Nnight...???%K%P

0x3A4
And why did she get into a taxi, and where is she going%Nin it...???%K%P

0x3B0
I suddenly realize my whole body is soaked with water.%K%P

0x3BC
I am assaulted by a stinging cold.%K%P

0x3C8
For now, I'll go back to the lodge.%K%P

0x3D4
When I turn around, I hear the sound of a window closing.%K%P

0x3E0
Someone might be awake...%K%P

0x3EC
I return to the living room while shivering.%K%P

0x45C
I go back in through the front door, and stare in the%Ndarkness to check my surroundings.%K%P

0x468
I don't sense anyone else's presence.%K%P

0x474
There's no sign that any of the others are awake.%K%P

0x480
Which means that the sound I heard earlier... the window%Nclosing, that is, was just my imagination?%K%P

0x48C
When I try thinking of it that way, it feels like the sound of%Nthe bell I heard earlier and the taxi were all just illusions.%K%P

0x498
Of course, Saki's ponytail swaying in the rain would be%Nthe same...%K%P

0x4A4
(Am I... still half-asleep?)%K%P

0x4B0
I must be so overwhelmed that I'm hallucinating. That must%Nbe it...%K%P

0x4BC
In the first place, I can't think of anywhere Saki would go%Nout to this late at night.%K%P

0x4C8
And in this rain to boot...%K%P

0x500
As I nod to myself, I return to my room and change my%Nclothes.%K%P

0x50C
I once again crawl into my still warm bed, and close my%Neyes.%K%P

0x518
I strangely feel much less troubled now than before.%K%P

0x5A0
I wake up.%K%P

0x5AC
As usual, the sound of the rain is still echoing.%K%P

0x5B8
It's an intense sound that feels like it's directly hitting my%Nears...%K%P

0x5C4
The downpour is probably still going on.%K%P

0x5D0
It's a little too loud for me to try to fall asleep again...%NWhen I turn over in my bed while having thoughts like%Nthat...%K%P

0x5EC
Izumi「WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!!?」%K%P

0x614
I hear a loud scream.%K%P

0x620
Feeling uneasy, I jump out of the bed.%K%P

0x658
When I rush into the living room, everyone else gathers in%Nsuccession.%K%P

0x664
In the center, Izumi-san is flustered, overturning her%Nhandbag.%K%P

0x670
Her face is has gone pale, and her eyes are bloodshot.%K%N

0x67C
This isn't like her at all.%K%P

0x688
Makoto「Izumi-san! What happened!?」%K%P

0x69C
Izumi「Yesterday's proceeds... they're all gone!」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「... What!?」%K%P

0x6C4
Kurumi「Onee-chan, did you look thoroughly?」%K%P

0x6D0
Izumi「Of course!」%K%P

0x6EC
Yuka「Did you possibly put them down in a different place?」%K%P

0x6F8
Izumi「No way. This is the only place they'd be!」%K%P

0x714
Okuhiko「If that's the case, then they were stolen. That's the only%Npossibility I can think of...」%K%P

0x720
Makoto「'Stolen'... Are you saying one of us stole them!?」%K%P

0x73C
Okuhiko「Don't be hasty. I wouldn't go as far as to say that.」%K%P

0x758
Haruka「Are you sure she was the only one stolen from...?」%K%P

0x774
Izumi「What?」%K%P

0x790
Haruka「Maybe all our wallets were stolen from as well...」%K%P

0x7A4
Okuhiko「It'd be best if we checked them all.」%K%P

0x7B8
Yuka begins to run for her room.%K%P

0x7C4
Taking that as a signal, we all run off to check our%Nrespective wallets.%K%P

0x7D0
—Several minutes later.%K%N

0x7DC
All our faces have gone pale.%K%P

0x7E8
Though we've all gathered, nobody says a word.%K%P

0x7F4
Only the sound of the pouring rain can be heard.%K%P

0x808
Yuka「What should we do?」%K%P

0x814
Yuka finally speaks.%K%P

0x820
With a concerned expression, Kurumi looks at Izumi-san.%K%N

0x82C
Izumi-san is biting her thumbnail.%K%P

0x848
Haruka「Perhaps someone amongst us is the culprit.」%K%P

0x854
Makoto「Haruka, don't say something so stupid.」%K%P

0x860
Haruka「It's a possibility.」%K%P

0x87C
Okuhiko「Yeah, that's true, but there's something that's bugging%Nme.」%K%P

0x890
Yuka「What?」%K%P

0x89C
Makoto「More importantly, we need to call the police!」%K%P

0x8B0
Okuhiko「Wait. Before that, I-」%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「This isn't the time to be telling us your concerns!」%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka「He's right. Anyway, the police...」%K%P

0x8F4
I stand in front of the phone and pick up the receiver.%K%P

0x900
As my hands tremble, I'm about to dial the number for the%Npolice, when all of the sudden...%K%P

0x90C
... The front door quietly opens.%K%P

0x954
I can hear the loud sound of the rainfall.%K%P

0x960
I turn around, and look towards the front door.%K%P

0x9A8
Saki「Pardon my intrusion! Makoto-kun, are you there?」%K%P

0x9B4
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x9C0
I put the receiver down for the time being.%K%P

0x9CC
Saki enters the living room while wiping the raindrops out%Nof her hair.%K%P

0x9F0
Saki「Sorry for barging in like this, but it's really pouring out%Nthere. Sorry, but could I borrow a towel?」%K%P

0x9FC
Yuka heads towards the kitchen.%K%N

0xA08
Izumi-san slightly raises her head and looks at Saki.%K%N

0xA14
Okuhiko glances at Saki.%K%P

0xA20
Haruka slowly steps back.%K%N

0xA2C
Kurumi looks at Saki with upturned eyes, her head still%Nhanging downwards.%K%P

0xA38
Saki, not noticing how different the others are acting,%Napproaches me.%K%P

0xA4C
Saki「Ah, Makoto-kun... there's a few things I have to tell you,%Nokay?」%K%P

0xA58
Makoto「Saki, now's not the best time...」%K%P

0xA6C
Saki「Huh? Is something wrong?」%K%P

0xA78
Saki seems to have finally noticed everyone's change%Nin behavior.%K%P

0xA84
She tilts her head questioningly as she surveys her%Nsurroundings.%K%P

0xAA0
Yuka「A thief broke in.」%K%P

0xABC
Saki「What? A thief...?」%K%P

0xAC8
Makoto「Everyone's money was stolen. All of yesterday's%Nproceeds from Lunabeach are completely gone as well...」%K%P

0xAE4
Okuhiko「... Don't tell me... it was you?」%K%P

0xAF8
Saki「Wha...」%K%P

0xB04
Okuhiko「You came here in the dead of night last night, right? I%Nsaw it. I saw you just as you left the lodge. And where%Ndid you go on that taxi you got into?」%K%P

0xB10
... Then... that really wasn't an illusion after all...%K%P

0xB2C
Yuka「Is that true?」%K%P

0xB48
Saki「I-I...」%K%P

0xB64
Okuhiko「You can't say you don't know about it. There was%Nanother witness...」%K%P

0xB80
Yuka「Who?」%K%P

0xB94
Okuhiko「Ishihara... Would you please tell us exactly what you%Nsaw?」%K%P

0xBB0
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you saw it?」%K%P

0xBBC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBD8
Yuka「What did you see?」%K%P

0xBEC
Okuhiko「You chased her outside, didn't you? You should have%Nseen her face as well...」%K%P

0xC00
Yuka「Makoto, you chased her?」%K%P

0xC0C
Makoto「N-No, I...」%K%P

0xC20
Okuhiko「Would you stop lying?」%K%P

0xC2C
I lower my head, fully aware of the others' piercing glares.%K%P

0xC38
I lift my face and look towards Saki.%K%N

0xC44
She is staring straight into my eyes.%K%P

0xC50
Makoto「... Yeah, I definitely followed them...」%K%P

0xC6C
Izumi「Who was it?」%K%P

0xC88
Yuka「Who!?」%K%P

0xCC0
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xCDC
Haruka「...」%K

0x1F60
"Well, Saki?"

0x1F6C
"..."

0xD40
Makoto「Well, Saki?」%K%P

0xD54
Saki「!!!」%K%P

0xD70
Kurumi「Saki-san, is this true!?」%K%P

0xD84
Haruka「It's written all over her face.」%K%P

0xDA0
Okuhiko「It's settled then. I've been wondering this whole time what%Nyou were doing.」%K%P

0xDB4
Makoto「Saki... what did you do here... last night?」%K%P

0xDC8
Saki「I... I didn't do it.」%K%P

0xDD4
Saki「... I didn't steal anything!」%K%P

0xDE0
Makoto「Then why don't you explain to all of us what you were%Ndoing?」%K%P

0xDEC
Saki「I don't know!」%K%P

0xDF8
Makoto「How can you not know what you did yourself?」%K%P

0xE04
Saki「I don't know what I don't know!」%K%P

0xE20
Izumi「Saki-chan... can I ask you one thing? ... Was it you?」%K%P

0xE3C
Saki averts her eyes. She purses her lips, and clenches%Nher hands into fists.%K%P

0xE58
Izumi「Saki-chan!?」%K%P

0xE6C
Kurumi「Will you tell us? Will you tell us the truth?」%K%P

0xE80
Saki「...」%K%P

0xE8C
Makoto「Saki, don't be stubborn at a time like this.」%K%P

0xEA0
Saki「... Don't you trust me?」%K%P

0xEAC
Makoto「I do.」%K%P

0xEC0
Saki「You're lying!」%K%P

0xECC
Makoto「No I'm not!」%K%P

0xED8
Saki「If I'm not lying, then why are you ordering me to explain!?」%K%P

0xEE4
Makoto「Th-That's...」%K%P

0xEF0
Saki「So you can't trust me unless I use words!?」%K%P

0xEFC
Makoto「You're wrong! It's because I trust you that I want you to%Nexplain!」%K%P

0xF08
Saki slowly shakes her head...%K%P

0xF14
Saki「You're the same, Makoto... All humans are the same!!」%K%P

0xF54
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xF60
Okuhiko「Hey! Ishihara!?」%K%P

0xF6C
Makoto「I don't know... I just don't know...」%K%P

0xF78
I just want to scream that she's innocent...%K%P

0xF84
"You're wrong! It wasn't Saki!"— I want to so badly, but%NI can't.%K%P

0xF90
That person I saw last night was definitely Saki.%K%P

0xF9C
That's why I can't cover for her. Even though I want to%Ntrust her, I can't.%K%P

0xFA8
I don't know what to do.%K%P

0xFB4
My mind is scrambled, and I lose the ability to make any%Nsound judgments.%K%P

0xFC8
Okuhiko「Whatever... Judging from your behavior, you don't even%Nneed to say anything for me to know...」%K%P

0xFDC
Okuhiko「Saki-chan! What were you doing here last night!?」%K%P

0xFF8
Saki「I... I didn't do it.」%K%P

0x1004
Saki「... I didn't steal anything!」%K%P

0x1020
Okuhiko「If that's the case, then why don't you tell us what you%Nwere doing?」%K%P

0x103C
Saki「I don't know!」%K%P

0x1058
Okuhiko「There's no way you don't know about what you did!」%K%P

0x1074
Saki「I don't know what I don't know!」%K%P

0x1088
Izumi「Saki-chan... can I ask you one thing? ... Was it you?」%K%P

0x109C
Saki averts her eyes. She purses her lips, and clenches%Nher hands into fists.%K%P

0x10A8
Izumi「Saki-chan!?」%K%P

0x10C4
Kurumi「Will you tell us? Will you tell us the truth?」%K%P

0x10D0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x10E4
Makoto「... Saki...」%K%P

0x10F0
I finally manage to wring my voice out.%K%P

0x10FC
Saki looks towards me.%K%P

0x1108
Her desperate gaze is begging me to help her...%K%P

0x111C
Saki「Makoto-kun... you trust me, right?」%K%P

0x1128
Makoto「Yeah... I trust you...」%K%P

0x113C
Saki「... You're lying!」%K%P

0x1148
Makoto「I'm not...」%K%P

0x1154
Saki「If you're not lying, then why aren't you saying anything!?%NWhy aren't you saying it wasn't me!?」%K%P

0x1160
Makoto「Th-That's...」%K%P

0x116C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1178
Makoto「Saki... give an answer so that... everyone will%Nunderstand...」%K%P

0x1184
Makoto「Once you do that, everyone-」%K%P

0x1190
Saki「So you can't trust me either unless I use words!?」%K%P

0x119C
Makoto「You're wrong... I want you to say it because I want to%Ntrust you...」%K%P

0x11A8
Saki slowly shakes her head...%K%P

0x11B4
Saki「You're the same, Makoto... All humans are the same!!」%K%P

0x11C8
Saki turns back, and bursts out the front door.%K%P

0x11D4
Makoto「Saki!!」%K%P

0x1294
Saki begins to descend the forest path, which has%Npractically changed into a marsh, as if she's tumbling%Ndown.%K%P

0x12A0
I desperately chase after her.%K%P

0x12D8
I keep running against the pouring rain.%K%P

0x12E4
I slowly close the distance between Saki and I.%K%P

0x12F0
Before long, Saki gets onto the road that leads to the%Ncape.%K%P

0x12FC
Those cherry blossom trees... I also immediately rush%Nonto the tree-lined street.%K%P

0x1334
I chase Saki.%K%P

0x1340
If we continue like this, we'll arrive at Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0x134C
In other words, a dead end...%K%P

0x1358
At that time, what should I say to Saki?%K%P

0x1364
What do I even want to say once I catch up with her?%K%P

0x1370
"You don't need words..."%K%P

0x137C
"I'll become the cat and the cherry blossom tree."%K%P

0x1388
I said that to Saki yesterday...%K%P

0x1394
Even so... I couldn't completely trust Saki.%K%P

0x13A0
What am I supposed to say to her now, of all times...?%K%P

0x13E8
The tip of the cape... the dead end...%K%P

0x13F4
Saki grips the fence with her back turned to me.%K%P

0x1400
I slow down, and cautiously approach her.%K%P

0x140C
I hear the sound of waves breaking at the bottom of the%Ncliff.%K%P

0x1418
The cold rain intensely beats down on Saki's back.%K%P

0x1424
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1430
I call out to her.%K%P

0x143C
Saki doesn't try to answer or turn around...%K%N

0x1448
—Suddenly, she begins to cross over the boundary%Nof the dead end!%K%P

0x1454
Makoto「Saki!!!」%K%P

0x1460
I kick off the wet ground and start running.%K%P

0x146C
Saki climbs over the iron fence, and stands on the%Nopposite side of it.%K%P

0x1478
She can't be...%K%P

0x1510
Saki「Stay back!」%K%P

0x151C
Makoto「...!!」%K%P

0x1528
Saki「Don't get any closer!」%K%P

0x1534
I come to a halt.%K%P

0x1540
The fiercely blowing wind waves through Saki's hair.%K%P

0x154C
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1558
Makoto「I... I... I swore to always continue believing in only you...%NEven though I swore that...」%K%P

0x1564
Saki「It's fine... it doesn't matter anymore... It doesn't matter%Nanymore...」%K%P

0x1570
Saki glances directly downwards.%K%P

0x157C
My chest tightens from the painful look in her eyes.%K%P

0x1588
Saki「No one even gives a shit about me anymore!」%K%P

0x1594
Makoto「You're wrong, Saki! That's not...」%K%P

0x15A0
As I say that, I carefully step towards Saki.%K%P

0x15AC
And, at that time...%K%P

0x15B8
Saki quietly raises her dangling left hand, and opens it...%K%P

0x15C4
Lying there... in her palm is...%K%P

0x15D8
... the bell.%K%P

0x15E4
It's that bell.%K%P

0x15F0
The bell she said she lost... in the ocean.%K%P

0x15FC
Even though she said Haruka had it now...%K%P

0x1610
Saki「I've had it the whole time...」%K%P

0x161C
Makoto「Wh-Why...?」%K%P

0x1628
Saki「I was also lying to you.」%K%P

0x1634
Saki「I didn't trust you.」%K%P

0x1640
Saki「I don't trust people. I can't trust them... I don't want to%Ntrust them!」%K%P

0x164C
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1658
Saki「I never thought of wanting someone to trust me either... I%Nwas fine not being trusted!」%K%P

0x1664
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1670
Saki「...」%K%P

0x167C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1688
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1694
Makoto「Saki... please... listen to me...」%K%P

0x16A0
I take a step forward.%K%P

0x16AC
Saki「I told you not to get any closer!」%K%P

0x16B8
I take another step forward.%K%P

0x16C4
Saki「Stay away!」%K%P

0x16D0
Saki「Don't get any closer, or I'll really...」%K%P

0x16DC
I gently reach my hand out.%K%P

0x16E8
Saki slowly shakes her head.%K%P

0x16F4
While continuing to keep my hand stretched out, I%Napproach her even more.%K%P

0x1700
Makoto「Take my hand...」%K%P

0x170C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1718
Makoto「Take my hand, Saki...」%K%P

0x1724
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1730
I take another firm step... at that instant!%K%P

0x174C
Saki lets go of the fence with her right hand.%K%P

0x1758
She gently closes her eyes...%K%P

0x1764
... Her body leans backwards.%K%P

0x1770
The bell slips and falls from her now powerless left hand...%K%P

0x17E4
And like that... she falls...%K%P

0x17F0
She falls into the pitch black, alluring darkness...%K%P

0x17FC
Like a scrap of paper dancing in the wind...%K%P

0x1808
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1814
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0x1820
Makoto「Why... Saki...」%K%P

0x1838
Makoto「SAKIIIIIIIIII!!!」%K%P
