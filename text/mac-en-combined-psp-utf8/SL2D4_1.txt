The next morning...%K%P

0x1AC
I've gone to visit Saki at her summer house with the%Nbasket that I was somehow able to fix with a little help%Nfrom Haruka.%K%P

0x1B8
I press the intercom's button, and speak up.%K%P

0x1C4
Makoto「Ah, it's me... It's Makoto.」%K%P

0x1D0
Saki「... What is it?」%K%P

0x1DC
Makoto「I need to talk with you for a bit.」%K%P

0x1E8
I summon Saki to come outside.%K%P

0x1F4
While waiting for her to come out, I examine the basket%Nover and over again.%K%P

0x200
(Hmm... My handywork isn't so bad.)%K%P

0x20C
(Perhaps I would've been able to fix it last time as well...)%K%P

0x218
Just then, Saki appears, breaking my train of thought.%K%P

0x22C
Saki「So, what are you doing here?」%K%P

0x238
I silently hold out the basket to her.%K%P

0x24C
Saki「What... about it?」%K%P

0x258
Makoto「'What about it'... umm...」%K%P

0x264
Makoto「I thought for sure that this was probably your favorite...」%K%P

0x270
Saki「...」%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「In other words... I guess you could say that I felt that, um,%Nhow do I put it...」%K%P

0x290
Saki「And?」%K%P

0x29C
Crap... This is going completely at Saki's pace!%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「... S-So, since I thought this was important to you, I%Nfigured that, umm...」%K%P

0x2BC
Saki snorts as if she's scornfully mocking me and turns%Naround.%K%P

0x2C8
Without a word, she immediately begins to head back%Ninside...%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「H-Hey, wait...」%K%P

0x2E0
I chase after Saki, begging pathetically.%K%P

0x2EC
This kinda feels like I'm doing the same things I did last%Ntime...%K%P

0x34C
When I take a step into the living room of the summer%Nhouse, Saki suddenly turns around, furious.%K%P

0x360
Saki「Who the hell said it was okay for you to come in?」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「Y-You just left without even fully hearing me out. It's not%Nlike I'm done talk-」%K%P

0x380
Saki「I thought I told you not to talk until I say so.」%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x398
When I shut my mouth, Saki glances at the basket in my%Nhands.%K%P

0x3AC
Saki「You fixed it, huh... hmm...」%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3CC
Saki「It's all right. I was going to throw it out anyway.」%K%P

0x3D8
Saki「You can buy these anywhere, right? They're mass%Nproduced. It's not like they're unique.」%K%P

0x3E4
Saki's being stubborn.%K%N

0x3F0
I already know that she's just trying to act tough.%K%P

0x404
Saki「How naive. Were you planning on buttering me up with%Nsomething like this?」%K%P

0x410
Ha ha... I instinctively laugh.%K%P

0x41C
Although she says that, Saki will come to thank me%Ntonight.%K%P

0x428
Making such a silly excuse like, "I was on a walk in the%Nmiddle of the night,"...%K%P

0x43C
Saki「What's so funny?」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「Sorry. You're just acting kinda cute...」%K%P

0x45C
Saki「D-Don't be stupid!」%K%P

0x468
Makoto「You're wrong. There's nothing stupid about it.」%K%P

0x47C
Saki「You're lying!」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「I'm not lying! Didn't I tell you? I said that 'I'll continue to%Nonly trust you'...」%K%P

0x494
Saki「Then yesterday was...」%K%P

0x4B0
Makoto「That was...」%K

0x818
Just apologize.

0x824
Explain the circumstances.

0x50C
Makoto「I'm sorry about that... I have no excuse.」%K%P

0x518
Saki「What's that mean?」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「So I won't think of even asking you to try to forgive me,%Nand I don't care if you scorn me...」%K%P

0x530
Saki「...」%K%P

0x53C
Makoto「But there's just one thing... that I want to ask you to do...」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「Please talk with Haruka.」%K%P

0x554
Makoto「I feel as if you and Haruka are both strangely out of%Nsync. You two are making the same mistake...」%K%P

0x560
Makoto「Both of you are stubborn because you two are under%Nthe false impression that the other is a bad person!」%K%P

0x56C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x578
Makoto「I know you're scared. But if you don't talk now, then you'll%Nsurely never recover from this...」%K%P

0x584
Saki「...」%K%P

0x590
Makoto「Will you quietly leave this to me?」%K%P

0x59C
I solemnly ask her this.%K%P

0x5A8
Saki「... Do you think I can believe that?」%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「Trust me... this time...」%K%P

0x5C0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5D8
Saki ponders for a little while...%K%P

0x5E4
Saki「I understand.」%K%P

0x5F0
... And before long, she quietly answers.%K%P

0x628
Makoto「That was just a pretext Haruka and I used so that we%Ncould go out to talk together with you...」%K%P

0x634
Saki「What's that mean?」%K%P

0x640
Makoto「I also told this to Haruka, but it really would be best for%Nthe two of you to have a talk.」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「I feel as if you and Haruka are both strangely out of%Nsync. You two are making the same mistake...」%K%P

0x658
Makoto「Both of you are stubborn because you two are under%Nthe false impression that the other is a bad person!」%K%P

0x664
Saki「...」%K%P

0x670
Makoto「I know you're scared. But if you don't talk now, then you'll%Nsurely never recover from this...」%K%P

0x67C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x688
Makoto「Will you quietly leave this to me?」%K%P

0x694
I solemnly ask her this.%K%P

0x6A0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x6AC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6B8
Saki「... Is it really okay for me to trust you?」%K%P

0x6C4
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x6D0
Saki「It's okay for me to trust you this time?」%K%P

0x6DC
I give her a deep nod.%K%P
