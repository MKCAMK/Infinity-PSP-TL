It's probably past 10:00 now, isn't it?%K%P

0x160
It seems Kurumi finally got tired of talking, as she headed%Nup to Lunabeach's second floor while rubbing her%Nsleepy eyes.%K%P

0x16C
At last, I'm finally in a situation where Izumi-san and I are%Nalone.%K%P

0x178
In that time, I keep reminding myself that I have to ask%NIzumi-san about "that story", no matter what.%K%P

0x184
I continue to tell myself that I ought to start talking to her%Nabout it, but I keep feeling like the timing isn't exactly%Nright.%K%P

0x190
Instead, we continue to chatter on about trivial things...%K%P

0x19C
Exactly two hours have passed since Kurumi went up to%Ngo to sleep.%K%P

0x1A8
The date display on my watch has already changed to%Nthe 6th...%K%P

0x218
Izumi「All right... well then, perhaps it's about time that I go to%Nsleep as well...」%K%P

0x22C
Izumi-san tries to stand up.%K%P

0x238
Makoto「Izumi-san...!」%K%P

0x244
I frantically try to stop her.%K%P

0x258
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x264
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x270
And then, I finally decide to ask about "that story."%K%P

0x298
Makoto「Izumi-san... could you please... tell me the rest of that%Nstory from yesterday?」%K%P

0x2A4
Izumi「Th-The story from yesterday... what story?」%K%P

0x2B0
Makoto「The story you were telling me... on that pier...」%K%P

0x2C4
In that instant, Izumi-san's expression turns tense.%K%P

0x2D0
Izumi「R-Right... That story... huh...?」%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2E8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x300
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x30C
Izumi「You might think 'Why are you saying this now?', but... That%Nstory... I don't think it's something I should have told you.」%K%P

0x318
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x324
Izumi「After all, that story... is something I feel that I mustn't tell%Nanyone else...」%K%P

0x330
Izumi「For Kurumi's... sake...」%K%P

0x33C
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x348
Makoto「I... saw it... I saw the scar on Kurumi's back...」%K%P

0x35C
Izumi「!!!」%K%P

0x368
Makoto「But I... I said nothing...」%K%P

0x37C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x388
Makoto「To be honest... it was much more horrifying... than I ever%Ncould have imagined...」%K%P

0x394
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Kurumi's scar and that story... there's a connection%Nbetween them, isn't there?」%K%P

0x3AC
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「Right now, it seems that Kurumi is still bothered by that%Nscar...」%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「One way or another, I want to heal... Kurumi's emotional%Nscars...」%K%P

0x3D0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x3DC
Makoto「She didn't get that scar from falling down the%Nstairs—did she?」%K%P

0x3E8
Makoto「'She probably got it shortly after she was born,'...%NKurumi's realized that, you know.」%K%P

0x3F4
Makoto「What was the real cause?」%K%P

0x400
Makoto「The shrine... Kurumi's kidnapping... the fact that she may%Nnot be your real sister... They're all connected somehow,%Nright?」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「Please tell me, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x418
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x424
Izumi-san keeps her eyes firmly on the ground, her%Nmouth tightly shut.%K%P

0x430
At this rate, she's not going to tell me anything, is she?%K%N

0x43C
—Just what happened to Kurumi as a baby?%K%P

0x448
If I don't know that, then I don't think I can heal Kurumi's%Nscars.%K%P

0x454
No... more importantly, it might be that I just want to learn%Neverything about Kurumi above everything else.%K%P

0x460
I want to find the main cause of Kurumi's pain, and take%Naway that suffering... I have to.%K%P

0x4A8
Izumi「Kurumi is...」%K%P

0x4B4
Izumi-san suddenly starts speaking.%K%P

0x4C0
Izumi「Kurumi is... my real... sister.」%K%P

0x4CC
Izumi「Even if we're not related by blood... she's still my real%Nsister...」%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4E4
Izumi「Ever since long ago, Kurumi and I were always together...」%K%P

0x4F0
Izumi「Because our parents were always away from home, ever%Nsince she was a kid, I've been Kurumi's substitute mother.」%K%P

0x4FC
Izumi「From aiding her with cooking to her troubles with%Nhomework, I saw it all...」%K%P

0x508
Izumi「Before I knew it, in the blink of an eye, it was my duty to%Nattend her parent's visit days and her parent-teacher%Nconferences...」%K%P

0x514
Izumi「Now that I think about it... when Kurumi was in 3rd grade...%Nher homeroom teacher gave the assignment of 'please%Ndraw a picture of your mother'...」%K%P

0x520
Izumi「But what Kurumi drew... was a picture of me...」%K%P

0x52C
Izumi「When she got home, Kurumi said, 'the teacher scolded%Nme', and cried...」%K%P

0x538
Izumi「At that time, I was in middle school, but I immediately%Nstormed into the elementary school's staff room to yell%Nat that teacher.」%K%P

0x544
Izumi「And you know what? Kurumi... stuck her tongue out at%Nthat homeroom teacher while hiding behind my back...」%K%P

0x550
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x55C
Izumi「... She was always following me, tottering all the way...」%K%P

0x568
Izumi「We brushed our teeth together, were together when we%Nslept... and even when I got phone calls from boyfriends,%NKurumi was by my side.」%K%P

0x574
Izumi「I was the one who understood Kurumi the best.」%K%P

0x580
Izumi「And conversely, I thought Kurumi was the one who%Nunderstood me the best as well...」%K%P

0x58C
Izumi「That Kurumi... there's no one more important to me than%Nher...」%K%P

0x598
Izumi「Because Kurumi's the person that she is...」%K%P

0x5A4
Izumi「... It doesn't matter if we're not related by blood.」%K%P

0x5B0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5BC
Izumi「That's why... I've had enough...」%K%P

0x5C8
Izumi「I'll keep her away from the shrine... no matter what...」%K%P

0x5D4
Izumi「As for that story... I've already decided to bury it deep%Nwithin me...」%K%P

0x5E8
After Izumi-san finishes talking, her eyes become very%Nrelaxed.

0x5F4
There's absolutely no way I can pry any further.%K%P

0x600
(This is Izumi-san and Kurumi's problem...)%K%P

0x60C
(In the first place, it might have been something that an%Noutsider like me shouldn't have gotten involved with in%Nthe first place.)%K%P

0x618
That's what I think...%K%N

0x624
And, at that time...%K%P

0x674
... We hear a sound...%K%N

0x680
... We then turn around...%K%P

0x694
Izumi「Ku... Kurumi...」%K%P

0x6A0
My heart stops.%K%P

0x6AC
Kurumi「Is it true?」%K%P

0x6B8
Kurumi「Is it really true?」%K%P

0x6CC
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x6D8
Kurumi「Kurumi isn't Onee-chan's... sister?」%K%P

0x6EC
Izumi「You're wrong, Kurumi! That's-」%K%P

0x6F8
Kurumi「You liar...」%K%P

0x704
Kurumi「Everyone... Everyone... is deceiving Kurumi...」%K%P

0x718
Izumi「I'm telling you, that's-」%K%P

0x72C
Kurumi「YOU LIAR!!」%K%P

0x75C
Kurumi starts to rush right out of Lunabeach!%K%P

0x768
Makoto「KURUMIIII!!」%K%P
