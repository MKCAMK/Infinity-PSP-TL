Her dazzling, marble-like white skin makes it clear that%Nshe's been well bred, as expected...%K%P

0x50
Hmmmmm...%K%P

0x6C
I just stand there, admiring her for a while. I wonder if I%Nshould say something.%K

0x9A0
Pass by silently.

0x9AC
Praise her dazzling body?

0x9B8
Spontaneously introduce myself.

0xBC
Just when I decide to pass by silently...%K%P

0xD0
Just when I'm thinking about how I should praise her%Ndazzling body...%K%P

0xDC
Saki「Hey, don't look at me like that!」%K%P

0xE8
Makoto「Ah!!」%K%P

0xF4
I can't think of a comeback...%K%P

0x100
Saki「You can't do that kind of thing to a girl!」%K%P

0x10C
Makoto「Gah!!」%K%P

0x118
Why does Saki know that?%K%P

0x124
No, wait, does she really think I was looking at her like a%Npervert?%K%P

0x130
I am struck speechless by her embarrassing%Naccusation...%K%P

0x13C
Saki「Well, if you want to stare, then I don't really care...」%K%P

0x148
Dammit, she's so full of herself.%K%P

0x154
She's so obscene...%K%P

0x160
I leave her without a retort, and quickly head for the%Nstand.%K%P

0x1C0
When I reach the stand, I look back once, but Saki has%Nalready disappeared from the deck chair...%K%P

0x1DC
...%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0x20C
Saki「What the hell? Don't just drop the honorifics with me.%NYou're talking way too familiar with me!」%K%P

0x218
Saki「Well, it's not like I care...」%K%P

0x224
Makoto「Anyway, I realized that I haven't really introduced myself%Nto you!」%K%P

0x230
Saki「You don't really need to do that!」%K%P

0x23C
Makoto「It's fine, just listen!」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「My name is Makoto Ishihara, 20 years old, and my type%Nis...」%K%P

0x254
Saki「I told you, I'm fine!」%K%P

0x260
Saki「I thought I told you not to talk to me until I say so!」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x278
Saki「...」%K%P

0x284
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x290
Saki「So, what's your type, then!?」%K%P

0x29C
Makoto「No, never mind.」%K%P

0x2A8
Saki「You've already started talking, so finish what you were%Nsaying, dammit!」%K%P

0x2B4
She's quite a domineering woman, but I'm starting to find%Nher sassy attitude alluring.%K%P

0x2C0
Plus, I have to admit she's incredibly beautiful (in other%Nwords, she's hot).%K%P

0x2CC
This isn't bad at all...%K%P

0x2D8
Saki「Why the hell are you smirking!? Don't tell me it's some%Ncrap like 'love at first sight'!?」%K%P

0x2E4
"However, she's quite self-conscious." I barely manage%Nto stop myself from saying this out loud...%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「That's a secret.」%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「Would you like me to get you a drink?」%K%P

0x308
For now, I've got to make an excuse to get out of this%Nawkward situation.%K%P

0x314
Saki「All right, please get me a ginger ale.」%K%P

0x320
Makoto「Okay!」%K%P

0x380
With that cheerful reply, I go to the stand...%K%P

0x38C
... But unfortunately, they're sold out of ginger ale.%K%P

0x398
Well then, what should I do?%K

0x9C4
Go back and ask her.

0x9D0
Just get some beer.

0x414
Makoto「It seems they don't have ginger ale.」%K%P

0x428
Saki「What the hell!? If they didn't have any, then it would have%Nbeen fine if you just bought something else! Geez, this is%Nsomething a kid could do!」%K%P

0x434
You self-centered... I was just trying be nice...%K%P

0x440
Well, I might as well ask her now that I'm here.%K%P

0x44C
Makoto「Then will you be fine with beer?」%K%P

0x458
Saki「I'll be fine with anything!」%K%P

0x464
She's so bitchy...%K%P

0x480
Makoto「They're all out, so is beer okay?」%K%P

0x4D0
Saki「Don't say that when you've already bought it!」%K%P

0x4DC
Saki「Well, I don't really care.」%K%P

0x51C
While the two of us drink beer, I strike up a conversation.%K%P

0x530
Makoto「By the way, Saki, do you prefer strong alcohol?」%K%P

0x53C
Saki「Well, I like normal.」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「How much is normal?」%K%P

0x554
Saki「Normal is normal.」%K%P

0x560
Makoto「So how much?」%K%P

0x574
Saki「You're so damn persistent! If I say normal, I mean normal!」%K%P

0x580
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x58C
We never seem to be able to get a pleasant%Nconversation rolling.%K%P

0x598
I'll try changing the topic.%K%P

0x5A4
Makoto「So why did you come to this island in the boonies all%Nalone?」%K%P

0x5B0
Saki「I'm just summering!」%K%P

0x5BC
Makoto「You're 'summering' even though it's still April?」%K%P

0x5D0
Saki「It's fine, isn't it!? Why the hell are you just asking me%Nquestions!?」%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5E8
Saki「So, is anything going on between you and Yuka?」%K%P

0x5F4
Makoto「Huh?!」%K%P

0x600
Saki「I'm asking if something's going on between you two.」%K%P

0x60C
Makoto「I don't think I can decide that when we've only just met...」%K%P

0x620
Saki「Nevertheless, you two seem to be on pretty good terms,%Nno?」%K%P

0x62C
Saki's certainly right.%K%P

0x638
I think so too.%K%P

0x644
Makoto「I don't think anything's going on yet.」%K%P

0x658
Saki「What do you mean, 'yet'!? So are you gonna do%Nsomething about that later?」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「N-Not to my knowledge, no...」%K%P

0x670
I can't help but stutter.%K%P

0x684
Saki「That's kind of suspicious... I'll just ask Yuka later.」%K%P

0x690
Makoto「Hey, hey, I said there's nothing going on!」%K%P

0x69C
Makoto「Don't go asking unnecessary things!!」%K%P

0x6B0
Saki「I'm joking. There's no way I'd ask something like that.」%K%P

0x6BC
Saki「But you're not annoyed with her?」%K%P

0x6C8
What's with this girl...%K%N

0x6D4
Why's she so concerned about Yuka?%K%P

0x6E0
Makoto「Well, I guess Yuka's okay.」%K%P

0x6EC
Makoto「But I think you're pretty good yourself.」%K%P

0x700
Saki「Oh, is that so? I didn't think you'd be the kind of person%Nwho'd say things like that.」%K%P

0x70C
Saki「Well, all guys tend to say such trite compliments anyway.」%K%P

0x718
She says that, but considering how much she's blushing,%Nit probably made her happy.%K%P

0x724
Before long...%K%P

0x738
Saki「See you.」%K%P

0x768
... Saki flashes me a smile before diving into the pool.%K%P

0x774
She left me alone...%K%P

0x780
Well then, what should I do?%K%P

0x78C
I already drank all the beer in the cup.%K%P

0x798
Makoto「Guess I should I get another one.」%K%P

0x7A4
I head back towards the stand to get more beer.%K%P

0x7C0
...%K%P

0x7CC
Just then...%K%P

0x7FC
Yuka「Huh? Well, if it isn't Makoto.」%K%P

0x808
Makoto「Oh... Yuka.」%K%P

0x814
Yuka「Anyway, are you thirsty? It's on me.」%K%P

0x820
Makoto「Oh! Looks like I got lucky! Thank you very much!」%K%P

0x82C
Yuka「Well then, just wait in that deck chair, and I'll get one for%Nyou.」%K%P

0x838
Makoto「Okay♪」%K%P

0x880
... ... ...%K%P
