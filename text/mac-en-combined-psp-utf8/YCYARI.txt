Makoto「Well then, ready to go?」%K%P

0x9C
Just as I take a step forward...%K%P

0xA8
Izumi「Wait a minute!」%K%P

0xC4
Yuka「Ah, what's wrong, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xD0
Izumi「Sorry. I forgot to tell you something...」%K%P

0xDC
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xE8
Izumi「We have a bike by the side of the shop. Please take it.」%K%P

0xFC
Yuka「A bike?」%K%P

0x108
Izumi「Well, even though it's not far on foot, you still have a lot%Nto bring back, right?」%K%P

0x114
Makoto「True. Carrying 22 pounds of rice while walking does%Nseem like a pain...」%K%P

0x120
Izumi「The key's attached to it. Well then, you two take care.」%K%P

0x12C
Yuka「Will do〜」%K%P

0x140
Izumi「... Ah! Can I ask you to do one more thing?」%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x160
Izumi「Could you also buy some saffron? If you can't find any,%Nthat's fine.」%K%P

0x16C
Makoto「What's saffron?」%K%P

0x180
Yuka「It's a seasoning you put on paella to make it look and%Nsmell nice.」%K%P

0x18C
Makoto「Huh...」%K%P

0x198
I'm surprised that Yuka out of all people would know%Nsomething like that.%K%P

0x1AC
Yuka「Okay, got it.」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi「Thank you so much.」%K%P

0x1D4
... Somehow, Izumi-san seems to be the type of person%Nwho can be a little forgetful...%K%P

0x1E0
That's what I think.%K%P

0x20C
Izumi「Ah! There's just one more thing...」%K%P

0x278
The eastern skies are completely engulfed in twilight.%K%N

0x284
Though my cheeks are being chapped by the cold wind, I%Ndon't feel very cold since I'm pedaling.%K%P

0x290
I take in the fresh evening air as I pedal leisurely.%K%P

0x2A4
Yuka「Hey.」%K%P

0x2B0
Yuka's voice pipes up from behind me.%K%P

0x2BC
Yuka「How did you really know?」%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「Huh? Know what?」%K%P

0x2D4
Yuka「Geez, don't play dumb...」%K%P

0x2E0
Yuka is riding on the bike's luggage carrier, her legs%Ndangling off from the side of the bike.%K%P

0x2EC
Instead of clinging to my back like I expected, she%Ninstead held onto the edges of the luggage carrier.%K%P

0x2F8
... Ah, who am I kidding? Only girls in fiction do something%Nlike that, right?%K%P

0x304
Yuka「The rice! How'd you know about it?」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「Dunno...」%K%P

0x31C
Yuka「You're playing dumb again.」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「No, I seriously don't know. I'm wondering that myself...」%K%P

0x334
Yuka「Do you have a sixth sense?」%K%P

0x340
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x34C
Yuka「Could it be that you actually have X-ray vision?」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「X-ray vision, huh... It feels completely different from that.」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「If I did have X-ray vision, then there would have been no%Nneed to look inside the rice bin.」%K%P

0x370
Makoto「Besides, I can think of much more interesting things to%Nsee through...」%K%P

0x384
Yuka「Such as?」%K%P

0x390
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3B8
Yuka slaps the back of my head in jest.%K%P

0x3C4
This is sort of playing out like a scene in a slapstick%Ncomedy.%K%P

0x3D8
Yuka「Well then, how about this?」%K%P

0x3E4
Yuka「Maybe you knew beforehand that Izumi-san would panic%Nlater when she realized there was no rice left...」%K%P

0x3F0
Yuka「In other words, you have the power to receive%Npremonitions!」%K%P

0x3FC
Makoto「... The power to receive premonitions?」%K%P

0x408
Just then, a memory flashes through my mind.%K%P

0x414
—It was when Haruka fell on Moon Beach.%K%N

0x420
It's true that I did see Haruka fall down before she%Nactually did.%K%N

0x42C
I knew it was going to happen in advance.%K%P

0x438
But it couldn't be...%K%P

0x44C
Yuka「Just kidding. There's no way that'd be it.」%K%P

0x458
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x464
Yuka「Well then, isn't it about time you tell me the truth?」%K%P

0x470
Makoto「I told you that...」%K%P

0x484
... After that, Yuka kept on badgering me about it until we%Nentered the shopping district.%K%P

0x490
I didn't have an answer for her.%K%N

0x49C
How was I able to do those things?%K%P

0x500
Yuka「Rice, saffron, and fresh cream... this is everything.」%K%P

0x50C
Currently, Yuka is checking the contents of a large%Ngrocery bag on the ground.%K%P

0x518
Right, Izumi-san's last request was for fresh cream.%K%P

0x524
Sheesh, what type of café doesn't stock up on fresh%Ncream?%K%P

0x530
And there's also the pizza incident from this afternoon...%Nthat shop has quite the sloppy business policy.%K%P

0x53C
Yuka「Well then, let's go back.」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「Yeah, everyone's waiting.」%K%P

0x554
I cram the groceries into the bike's basket.%K%P

0x560
The front wheel bends horribly from the weight.%K%P

0x5B0
I'm now regretting this.%K%N

0x5BC
What, you may ask?%W%W%W

0x5C8
Bringing Yuka along!%K%P

0x5D4
She doesn't weigh much, but those 22 pounds of rice%Nsure do. My thigh muscles are burning... Is this much pain%Neven normal?%K%P

0x5E0
Yuka「Good luck♪」%K%P

0x5EC
Yuka calls out from behind me.%K

0x888
Geez, she's so carefree...

0x894
"So... damn heavy..."

0x62C
(Geez, she's so carefree...)%K%P

0x638
I take my hands off of the handle bars for a bit. Just%Nthen, the rear wheel slips and collapses from the%Npressure.%K%P

0x654
Makoto「So... damn heavy...」%K%P

0x668
Yuka「Huh!? I'm not heavy! How rude.」%K%P

0x674
Makoto「No, it's not like that...」%K%P

0x680
As I try to explain myself to her, I see a rock on the road.%K%P

0x68C
Makoto「Whoa...!」%K%P

0x698
I abruptly turn in attempt to avoid it.%K%P

0x6A4
I try to turn the handles, but the rear wheel slips and%Ncollapses from the pressure as we dangerously swerve.%K%P

0x6B0
Yuka「Geez, watch the road. I'd hate to see your driving.」%K%P

0x6E8
When she says this, Yuka wraps her arms around my%Nback.%K%P

0x6F4
I feel two soft objects bulge against me.%K%N

0x700
My whole body then burns up with extreme heat...%K%P
