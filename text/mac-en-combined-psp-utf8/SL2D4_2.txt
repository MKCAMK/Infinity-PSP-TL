I take Saki to Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0xB4
Haruka is already waiting under the lighthouse.%K%N

0xC0
Last night, I asked Haruka to come here at this time.%K%P

0xCC
The two face each other underneath the lighthouse.%K%P

0xD8
Their bodies stiffen up due to the extreme tension.%K%P

0xE4
As I look back and forth between them, I slowly begin to%Ntalk.%K%P

0xF0
Makoto「All right... Well then, let's get this settled once and for all...」%K%P

0xFC
I place the bell in between Saki and Haruka.%K%P

0x108
Makoto「Saki, you took back a bell from a girl in a charcoal%Nburning hut whom you'd given the bell to in the first place.」%K%P

0x114
Makoto「The clone girl then chased after you, so you threw%Nstones at her, and wounded her forehead.」%K%P

0x15C
Saki「Yes...」%K%P

0x168
Makoto「And Haruka, when the bell you treasured was taken%Naway from you by some girl, you chased after her and%Nwere pushed away.」%K%P

0x174
Makoto「That's when you hit your forehead on the edge of a%Ndesk chair, and got that scar... is that right?」%K%P

0x188
Haruka「Yes...」%K%P

0x194
Makoto「So, in both of your stories, you both either took a bell or%Nhad one taken from you. Both stories resulted in a girl%Ngetting wounded on her forehead.」%K%P

0x1A8
Both of them nod.%K%P

0x1B4
Makoto「But what about the rest? For example, ages...」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「Haruka, how old were you when you got that scar on%Nyour forehead?」%K%P

0x1D4
Haruka「I don't know that, but... I think it was before I could go%Noutside...」%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「I see. Then what about you, Saki?」%K%P

0x1EC
Makoto「Do you remember... about how old you were when you%Nplayed with the girl from the charcoal burning hut?」%K%P

0x208
Saki「That's... my family's summer house had just been%Ncompleted, so... I was six years old...」%K%P

0x214
Makoto「If Saki was six, then Haruka was five at the time.」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「Normally, healthy five year olds in this country are able%Nto go outside.」%K%P

0x22C
Makoto「Which means that there's a large time gap in between%Nyour memories- Haruka's incident must have happened%Nsome time before Saki's.」%K%P

0x240
Saki「...」%K%P

0x24C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x258
Makoto「Also, your stories regarding the origin of the forehead%Nwound don't match up.」%K%P

0x264
Makoto「Even though Saki said it was 'a wound caused by%Nstones thrown at the girl', according to Haruka, it seems%Nit was 'a scar caused from hitting the edge of a desk%Nchair'.」%K%P

0x270
Makoto「Because of your very strong memories, both of you%Nneglected these small differentiations, and were%Nconvinced that the other was the girl in your memories.」%K%P

0x27C
Saki and Haruka look at each other timidly.%K%P

0x288
Makoto「And this... was the main reason why this happened.」%K%P

0x294
I say this, then hold up the bell.%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「Both of you wait here.」%K%P

0x2B4
Saki and Haruka nod, and I clench the hand holding the%Nbell into a fist.%K%P

0x2D0
Makoto「Because of this bell, you two both made a strange%Nmisunderstanding...」%K%P

0x2DC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2E8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「But this is the end. Your fighting will end here.」%K%P

0x364
They both nod.%K%P

0x370
Once I've confirmed that, I throw the bell over the cliff.%K%P

0x3B4
It shines in the sunlight for an instant, leaving behind a%Nsmall ring, and then it begins to sink into the sea...%K%P

0x3C0
With this, I've changed history. The previous conflict%Nbetween these two has disappeared without a trace...%K%P
