—And so, we didn't stop fishing until the late%Nafternoon.%K%P

0x84
We only took a break to head back to Lunabeach for%Nlunch. We caught nothing, since Haruka released every%Nsingle fish she caught.%K%P

0x90
Nevertheless, it was surprisingly fun. Afterwards, we%Nreturned to fishing and remained that way up until now.%K%N

0x9C
I decide to try ask her about Saki.%K%P

0xE4
Makoto「About what happened between you and Saki...」%K%P

0xF0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xFC
Makoto「When you told me you two were talking about fishing, um...%NThat was a lie, wasn't it?」%K%P

0x118
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0x124
Makoto「Then what was it? What did you say to Saki?」%K%P

0x130
Haruka「... If I tell you that, will you answer me honestly?」%K%P

0x13C
Makoto「O-Of course...」%K%P

0x148
Haruka「Really?」%K%P

0x154
Makoto「... Yeah, I promise you.」%K%P

0x160
Haruka puts away the fishing rods, then looks at me.%K%P

0x16C
Haruka「Have you ever kissed someone?」%K%P

0x178
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x184
Haruka「What is a 'kiss'?」%K%P

0x190
Makoto「Hold on. This is what you were asking Saki?」%K%P

0x19C
Haruka「Yes... I wanted to ask her if she'd kissed someone%Nbefore.」%K%P

0x1A8
She's lying again. Judging by how those two were acting%Nat that time, there was no way they were talking about%Nthat.%K%N

0x1B4
Even so, I say...%K

0x648
I have.

0x654
I haven't.

0x660
Umm...

0x20C
Makoto「I... I have.」%K%P

0x218
What am I saying?%K%N

0x224
The conversation is getting more and more sidetracked.%K%P

0x230
Haruka「What does it feel like to kiss someone?」%K%P

0x23C
Haruka asks me this with the innocent expression of a%Ncurious young girl.%K%P

0x248
T... This is bad. Everything's going at Haruka's pace.%K%N

0x254
If I don't change the subject soon, then...%K%P

0x268
Makoto「I... I haven't.」%K%P

0x274
What the hell am I saying? What kind of a response was%Nthat!?%K%P

0x280
Haruka「I see...」%K%P

0x28C
Haruka drops her head in disappointment. Just what did%NHaruka want to hear?%K%P

0x298
Haruka「Makoto... have you ever wanted to kiss someone?」%K%P

0x2A4
W-What? I don't know how to respond to that...%K%P

0x2B8
Makoto「Well, um, you see, I'm a guy... so...」%K%P

0x2C4
Since I'm with Haruka, I try to be blunt.%K%P

0x2D0
Haruka「Have you ever?」%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「You shouldn't ask something like that.」%K%P

0x2E8
Haruka「Is... that right?」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x300
Haruka「Then why do people kiss?」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「Hmm... It's probably to demonstrate their love and confirm%Ntheir feelings for each other.」%K%P

0x318
Haruka「Confirm...?」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「It's difficult to explain with words...」%K%P

0x330
Haruka「Then... let's kiss.」%K%P

0x33C
Makoto「Wh-What!?」%K%P

0x350
Haruka「Let's kiss.」%K%P

0x364
Haruka draws her face close to mine. Her expression%Nbegins to overwhelm my senses.%K%P

0x38C
My heart feels like it's bursting out of my chest. I steal a%Nglance at Haruka's face.%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「N-No... I can't kiss you for a reason like that...」%K%P

0x3AC
Haruka「Then does that mean you don't feel any affection for me,%NMakoto...?」%K

0x66C
No, it's not like that...

0x678
H... How should I answer that?

0x3F4
Makoto「No, it's not like that...」%K%P

0x400
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「All right, I understand. Well then, close your eyes.」%K%P

0x420
Makoto「No... u-um...」%K%P

0x42C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x438
Haruka's face gets gloomy as I struggle over my reply.%K%P

0x444
P-Please don't look at me with that sad face...%K%P

0x450
I decide to not run away and grant Haruka's wish.%K%P

0x45C
Makoto「All right, I understand. Well then, close your eyes.」%K%P

0x4A8
As I speak, Haruka closes her eyes, and I stare at her%Nface.%K%P

0x4B4
Haruka's cheeks quiver like jelly from nervousness. Her%Nbeckoning small lips glisten.%K%P

0x4C0
I gently kiss Haruka on the forehead.%K%P

0x4D4
It was just a peck and lasted for only a moment.%K%P

0x4E0
For some reason, I feel embarrassed, and quickly draw%Nback.%K%P

0x4EC
Haruka's eyes suddenly open, and she stares at me.%K%P

0x508
Haruka「This is...?」%K%P

0x514
When I return Haruka's gaze, a faint blush appears on%Nher cheeks. She quickly averts her gaze towards the%Nground.%K%P

0x520
I can't comprehend how I feel. It's like happiness... but I%Ncan't quite explain it...%K%P

0x534
—The sun is setting. We decide to finish putting away%Nthe fishing gear.%K%P

0x540
Our heightened awareness of each other made the trip%Nback to the lodge a quiet one.%K%P

0x578
Once we return to the lodge, it still feels kinda awkward,%Nso we retreat into our respective rooms.%K%P

0x584
Thank god Yuka and the others aren't back yet.%K%P
