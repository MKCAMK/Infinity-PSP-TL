I exit the shop.%K

0xA4
Saki is waiting there.%K%P

0xB0
Makoto「Well then, ready to go?」%K%P

0xBC
Just as I take a step forward...%K%P

0xD8
Izumi「Wait a minute!」%K%P

0xE4
Saki「Is something wrong?」%K%P

0xF0
Izumi「Sorry, I forgot! Buy these as well!」%K%P

0xFC
She hands me a small scrap of paper. It's covered in%Nwriting.%K%P

0x108
Huh? There's so much stuff on here. We have to buy all%Nof this?%K%P

0x114
Izumi「Also, we have a bike by the side of the shop. Please use%Nit. It'd be easier to bring the groceries back that way.」%K%P

0x120
Makoto「True. Just carrying the 22 pounds of rice alone does%Nseem like a pain...」%K%P

0x134
Izumi「The key's attached to it. Well then, you two take care.」%K%P

0x148
Makoto「Thank you very much.」%K%P

0x154
I thankfully bow my head as she walks back into the%Nshop.%K%P

0x168
Makoto「All right then, Saki... san?」%K%P

0x174
I lift my head, but I don't see her anymore. I try looking%Naround.%K%N

0x180
The setting sun illuminates the road by the shop.%K%P

0x18C
On it is Saki, who has already walked far ahead.%K%P

0x198
Huh? What's this? What's going on?%K%P

0x1A4
I quickly straddle the bike, and chase after Saki.%K%P

0x228
Saki steps away from the bike and continues to walk.%K%P

0x234
Makoto「What's wrong? You can ride in the back, you know.」%K%P

0x248
Saki「I'm fine.」%K%P

0x254
Makoto「You don't want to go shopping?」%K%P

0x260
Saki「I never said that.」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「Don't tell me a bike is too 'unseemingly' for you.」%K%P

0x280
Saki「Not really... That's not what I meant, but-」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「Then get on.」%K%P

0x2A0
When I stretch out my hand, Saki steps back again. She%Nseems to be trembling.%K%P

0x2AC
Makoto「Huh? Oh, I see... Now I understand...」%K%P

0x2B8
Saki「What?」%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「You're scared of bikes?」%K%P

0x2D8
Saki「N-No way! You're wrong!」%K%P

0x2E4
Makoto「Heh heh... is that so...」%K%P

0x2F0
Saki「Stop laughing, you creep! —I'll do it. I'll get on. Hurry up%Nand head straight there.」%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「Yes, ma'am.」%K%P

0x310
I wait as Saki slowly sits on the luggage carrier in a side%Nsaddle fashion.%K%P

0x31C
She looks really nervous. I start silently pedaling.%K%P

0x338
Seeing Saki like this, I...%K

0xF80
Get the urge to tease her a bit.

0xF8C
No, I shouldn't be so mean.

0x388
Saki「KYAA!」%K%P

0x394
Saki instinctively clings to my back.%K%P

0x3A0
Mission accomplished! For a while, I pedal steadily.%K Then I%Nstart to pick up speed.%K The pleasant afternoon breeze%Nruns through my whole body.%K%P

0x3AC
The feeling of Saki's breasts pressed against my back%Nisn't so bad, either.%K%P

0x3B8
Saki「Stop! Slow down!」%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「Huh? What was that?」%K%P

0x3D0
I pretend not to hear her. We're coming in on an easy hill,%Nso I increase the bike's speed more and more.%K%P

0x3DC
We're almost there; I can see the shopping district%Nahead of the curve. Saki screams louder as I pedal%Nharder.%K%P

0x3E8
I don't care. I'm getting excited. She's kind of cute when%Nshe's upset like this.%K%P

0x3F4
Saki「That's enough! Let me off!」%K%P

0x400
No can do, missy.%K%P

0x41C
Saki「L-L-Look out!」%K%P

0x454
She suddenly turns my head with her hand. Don't! I can't%Nsee!%K%P

0x460
Makoto「I-Idiot! We could've crashed into something. Let go!!」%K%P

0x47C
Saki「KYAA!」%K%P

0x488
Saki immediately clings to my back. Just as I thought. It%Nseems Saki has a phobia of bikes... no, a phobia of%Nspeed.%K%P

0x494
I don't want to torment her, so I pedal slowly.%K%P

0x4A0
At first, Saki was so scared that her arms were wound%Ntight around me, but she got used to it after a while. Now,%Nshe has a single hand lightly propped against my back.%K%P

0x4AC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「... Hey...?」%K%P

0x4C4
Saki「What?」%K%P

0x4D0
Makoto「... No... it's nothing.」%K%P

0x4DC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x4E8
It's quiet between us.%K%P

0x4F4
Whenever I try to talk to her, Saki just bluntly retaliates.%NThis isn't getting anywhere...%K%P

0x500
The atmosphere's become quite awkward. Guess this the%Nopposite of "time flies when you're having fun", huh...?%K%P

0x50C
If I had known things would be going this slow, then%Nshould I have sped up even if it would have scared%Nher...?%K%P

0x518
As I'm thinking about that, we soon approach a long%Ndecline.%K%P

0x524
It's neither steep nor is it gentle. Because of our%Ncombined weight, the bike is going to speed up from the%Ndecline.%K%P

0x530
Makoto「We're going to go faster. Hang on tight.」%K%P

0x53C
Saki「... O-Okay.」%K%P

0x548
Saki responds with a faint, trembling voice and nods.%NShe wraps her arms around me again.%K%P

0x554
I begin to pedal towards the hill.%K%P

0x560
Whoosh!%K%P

0x56C
Saki「KYAA!!」%K%P

0x578
Shit! We're going too fast!%K%N

0x584
We're sliding down the hill road faster than I expected.%K%N

0x590
Saki clings to my body with all of her might.%K%P

0x59C
With this bulging sensation against my back, I start to%Nthink that this isn't so bad.%K%P

0x5A8
Saki「No!! You're going too fast!」%K%P

0x5B4
I reluctantly reach for the brakes after hearing Saki%Nscream this over and over.%K%P

0x5C0
Where are the brakes... ah, here. ... Huh?%K%P

0x5CC
Click, click... I start to get the feeling that something is%Nwrong when nothing happens.%K%P

0x5D8
The bike shows no signs of slowing down at all. Oh... crap...%K%P

0x5E4
Saki「The brakes!! Hurry up! Slow us down!!」%K%P

0x5F0
Saki screams hysterically.%K%P

0x5FC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x608
Saki「Wh-What's wrong!? Hurry up!!」%K%P

0x614
Makoto「... Umm...」%K%P

0x620
Saki「... Wh-What?」%K%P

0x62C
Makoto「It seems... the brakes... aren't working.」%K%P

0x638
Saki「...」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x66C
Saki「... No way...」%K%P

0x678
Makoto「I'm... dead serious.」%K%P

0x684
To say that the bike needs fixing is putting it lightly.%K%P

0x690
There are parts loose here and there, and the chain is%Ndisconnected and loose.%K%P

0x69C
Izumi-san needs to learn how to take better care of%Nvehicles.%K%P

0x6A8
But wait... if the brakes aren't working...%K%P

0x6B4
Saki「... N... NOOOO!!!」%K%P

0x6C0
Saki's scream echoes around us.%K%P

0x6CC
Her grip tightens even more.%K%P

0x6D8
Makoto「Shit...!」%K%P

0x6E4
I try to think of ways on how I can reduce our speed. ...%NBut I'm drawing a blank.%K%P

0x6F0
Saki「STOOOOOP!!」%K%P

0x6FC
Saki's loud screams continue.%K%P

0x708
The bike's rampage continues. Suddenly, I see a curve%Nahead of us.%K%P

0x714
I instantly turn the handles...%W%W

0x74C
... but my arms are being pinned down due to Saki's arms.%K%P

0x758
We... We can't turn!!%K%P

0x764
Saki「Stop! Stop it!!」%K%P

0x770
It seems Saki's terror has reached its peak, as she's%Nfallen into panic. Naturally, she can't see the curve in%Nfront of us.%K%P

0x77C
Makoto「I-Idiot! Let go of my arm!! There's a curve!!」%K%P

0x788
Saki「Huh!? ... K-KYAAA!!」%K%P

0xA38
—And so, we've finally come back.%K%P

0xA44
We drag the bike, with its bent handles, warped saddle,%Nand smashed basket.%K%P

0xA50
The bike's tire, along with the rice, saffron, fresh cream,%Nand other groceries that were on the bike have become%Nridiculously squashed. Obviously, riding the bike back%Nwas impossible.%K%P

0xA5C
Yuka and Izumi-san run over to us.%K%P

0xA68
Izumi-san takes the shopping bags from my hands.%K%P

0xA74
Just then, I lose my strength and fall down.%K%P

0xA98
Izumi「Ah, you look terrible. We need to disinfect those wounds...」%K%P

0xAD8
Yuka「I heard from Saki. I guess the bike wasn't in a condition to%Nbe rode like that.」%K%P

0xAE4
Makoto「Is Saki... mad?」%K%P

0xAF8
Yuka「I don't think so.」%K%P

0xB04
Makoto「Huh, really?」%K%P

0xB10
If that's so, then I'm grateful.%K%P

0xB58
At that time, Saki comes out from inside.%K%P

0xB64
Our eyes meet...%K

0xF98
Try giving her a little smile.

0xFA4
Look away.

0xBAC
Our eyes meet, and I try giving her a little smile.%K%P

0xBC0
Saki gives a "hmph", and averts her eyes. She doesn't%Nsay a word.%K%P

0xBCC
(Wait a minute... Yuka!)%K%P

0xBE0
Makoto「What the hell, Yuka? You said she wasn't ma-」%K%P

0xBEC
As I'm saying this, Izumi-san sprays disinfectant into the%Nwound on my forehead.%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「OWWWW!」%K%P

0xC0C
Izumi「Put up with it...!」%K%P

0xC18
She slaps me lightly on the head.%K%P

0xC34
Yuka turns her head, snickering.%K%P

0xC40
I feel like somebody is glaring at me.%K%P

0xC54
Saki is staring at me intently.%K%P

0xC68
I look at her, but she averts her eyes again.%K%P

0xC74
Something then occurs to me.%K%N

0xC80
Why does Saki's face look so pained?%K%P

0xC9C
Our eyes meet, and I immediately look away.%K%P

0xCA8
It was because of my carelessness that she got hurt.%K%P

0xCB4
Yuka said otherwise, but she's obviously mad...%K%P

0xCC0
And at that time, a sharp pain runs through my forehead.%NIzumi-san sprayed disinfectant into the wound on my%Nforehead.%K%P

0xCCC
Makoto「OWWWW!」%K%P

0xCE0
Izumi「Put up with it...!」%K%P

0xCEC
She slaps me lightly on the head.%K%P

0xD08
Yuka turns her head, snickering. I can suddenly feel a%Npair of eyes glaring at me.%K%P

0xD1C
Saki is staring at me intently.%K%P

0xD30
I look at her, but it's Saki this time who looks away.%K%P

0xD3C
Something then occurs to me.%K%P

0xD48
Why does Saki look so pained?%K%P
