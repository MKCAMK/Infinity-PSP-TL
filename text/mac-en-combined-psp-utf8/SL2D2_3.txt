After that, I reunite with the others at Lunabeach.%K%P

0x68
However, I get absolutely no chances to talk to Haruka%Nall alone.%K%P

0x74
In the end, I catch up with her after I've returned to the%Nlodge and taken a bath.%K%P

0x80
I think asking her straight will be the best way.%K%P

0x8C
I tell her what I saw on the pier... and everything Saki told%Nme in the sickroom.%K%P

0x98
Makoto「What do you think, Haruka?」%K%P

0xAC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xB8
Makoto「Is the story she told about her childhood true? If so,%Nthen do you resent Saki?」%K%P

0xC4
Haruka「... I don't know.」%K%P

0xD0
Haruka「I don't know any of it...」%K%P

0xDC
Makoto「Then why is it that when you showed this to Saki, she%Nsaid threatening things to you?」%K%P

0xE8
I take out the bell to show her.%K%P

0xF4
Haruka「I picked that up on the beach last night... it was sort of%Nnostalgic.」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「Nostalgic?」%K%P

0x10C
Haruka「On the day it was taken from me... it felt like I had lost my%Nheart.」%K%P

0x118
Makoto「Saki took it away from you?」%K%P

0x124
Haruka「I don't really know... When I was a kid, I would always play%Nin my room all alone. I only had that bell... It's very similar...%Nto that bell I had back then...」%K%P

0x130
Haruka「But someone... a girl stole it from me. She said, 'This isn't%Nyours. Because you're just a replacement.' Then she%Npushed me, and I hit my head on the edge of a desk%Nchair... probably.」%K%P

0x13C
Haruka「At that time, I got a cut...」%K%P

0x190
Makoto「So that's what the small scar on your forehead came%Nfrom...」%K%P

0x19C
Haruka「When Saki saw this scar and that bell, she suddenly%Nchanged... she got scary...」%K%P

0x1A8
(... What's the meaning of this???)%K%P

0x1B4
I'm confused.%K%P

0x1C0
Both of their stories are similar in that they revolve%Naround a bell, but there's a lot of parts about them that%Njust doesn't mesh at all.%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「Wait a minute. Was the girl who took the bell from you%Nreally Saki?」%K%P

0x1E8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1F4
Haruka averts her eyes from me.%K%P

0x200
It seems she's taken no notice of the discrepancies in%Ntheir stories.%K%P

0x20C
It's the same with Saki.%K%P

0x218
They're both under the impression that the other is the%None in their story, despite not having all the facts of the%Ncase.%K%P

0x224
Things could get bad if I don't confirm a few more minor%Npoints...%K%P

0x230
That's what I think.%K%P

0x23C
I remember their odd rivalry that they had in the last set%Nof six days.%K%N

0x248
It originated from their childhood memories, which they%Ndidn't even attempt to examine more closely.%K%P

0x254
To the two of them, those memories are their "primal%Nscenery", defining moments of their early life.%K%P

0x260
In that "primal scenery", reason doesn't exist.%K%P

0x26C
Even if they spoke to a third-party about it, they would%Nstill remain stubborn and refuse to be swayed by logic...%K%P

0x278
Because of that, I think I need to arrange a meeting%Nbetween them in order to set things straight and clear%Nthings up.%K%P

0x284
However, I doubt they'd listen to me if I'm blatant about it.%K%P

0x290
There's also Yuka and the others to worry about. I don't%Nwant to attract any unwanted attention; that'd only%Nlower my chances even more.%K%P

0x29C
Just then, I remember.%K%P

0x2A8
Last time, on this very night... I promised to go fishing with%NHaruka.%K%P

0x2B4
I'll try using that.%K%P

0x2C0
I'll take those two to the pier, where they can settle the%Ndispute over who's right and who's wrong.%K

0x618
Invite her to go fishing.

0x624
No, should I be more direct?

0x310
Makoto「Hey, Haruka? Let's go fishing tomorrow!」%K%P

0x31C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「Well? Is it a promise?」%K%P

0x33C
Haruka「A promise...」%K%P

0x348
Makoto「That's right, a promise.」%K%P

0x354
Haruka「How can we make something like a promise?」%K%P

0x360
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x36C
Haruka「You don't know what will happen tomorrow... right?」%K%P

0x378
Makoto「We'll go tomorrow, no matter what happens. That's what%Nwe've decided.」%K%P

0x384
Haruka「How can you decide that?」%K%P

0x390
Makoto「That's...」%K%P

0x39C
Makoto「... because I trust you.」%K%P

0x3A8
Haruka「Trust...」%K%P

0x3B4
Makoto「And you trust me too.」%K%P

0x3C0
Haruka「I trust you too...」%K%P

0x3CC
Makoto「That's right. Without mutual trust, a promise means%Nnothing.」%K%P

0x3D8
Haruka「Mutual trust...」%K%P

0x3E4
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x3F0
Haruka「So then, you... and I... can trust each other?」%K%P

0x3FC
Makoto「That's right.」%K%P

0x408
Makoto「When tomorrow comes, don't forget this promise. No%Nmatter what happens, remember it. All right?」%K%P

0x414
I gulp as Haruka nods.%K%P

0x428
No, I should just be direct. That'll be faster.%K%P

0x434
It may be a little pushy, but I should try to persuade%NHaruka to meet directly with Saki.%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Say, Haruka? I think it'd be best if you met with Saki and%Ntalked.」%K%P

0x44C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x458
Makoto「Meet with Saki... tomorrow...」%K%P

0x46C
Haruka「... Why?」%K%P

0x478
Makoto「That's...」%K%P

0x484
Makoto「... Because I want to confirm it, no matter what!」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「That the two of you... are just both making%Nmisunderstandings about your respective pasts! I want%Nto prove that!」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「Will you trust me... Haruka?」%K%P

0x4A8
Haruka「Trust...」%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「That's right. I trust you, so please, trust me too...」%K%P

0x4C0
Haruka「I'll trust you too...」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「Yeah... If we trust each other like that, then we can clear%Nup this misunderstanding for sure!」%K%P

0x4D8
Haruka「Trust each other...」%K%P

0x4E4
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x4F0
Haruka「So then, you... and I... can trust each other?」%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「That's right. So promise to meet with Saki tomorrow...」%K%P

0x508
Haruka slowly nods.%K%P

0x514
Makoto「This is our own promise, no one else's. Keep that promise%Nno matter what. Don't tell anyone else about it. All right?」%K%P

0x528
...%K%P

0x534
Haruka leaves the room.%K%P

0x540
I lie down on the bed and close my eyes.%K%P

0x54C
(I hope... tomorrow goes well...)%K%P
