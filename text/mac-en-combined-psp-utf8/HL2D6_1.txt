Plop... When I come to my senses, it has begun to rain.%K%P

0x1B4
As if that first drop were a signal, innumerable raindrops%Ncome falling from the sky all at once.%K%P

0x1C0
My clothes get wet and cling to my skin, freezing my%Nwhole body.%K%P

0x1CC
The rain crashing down on the asphalt becomes a thin%Nfog, and the cold, wet air pierces my nose.%K%P

0x1D8
This is exactly the same smell from that time.%K%N

0x1E4
The smell from... that day of pouring rain.%K%P

0x1F0
Haruka's... Haruka's... in the middle of this intense%Ndownpour...%K%P

0x1FC
My heart feels like it's been crushed.%K%P

0x208
My impatience has grown so strong that I can't even%Nbreathe very well.%K%P

0x214
If I find Haruka quickly, then...%K%N

0x220
she won't... she won't... she won't...%K%P

0x22C
... ... ...%K%P

0x2B0
—!?%K%P

0x2BC
That's not an illusion.%K%P

0x2C8
As if bathing in the rain, Haruka stands on the shoreline%Nroad with her head lifted and her arms spread out.%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x2EC
Makoto「HARUKAAAA!!!」%K%P

0x300
At the sound of my voice, Haruka slowly turns around.%K%N

0x30C
The pained look in her eyes makes my chest tighten up%Nheavily.%K%P

0x34C
Haruka「... Makoto...」%K%P

0x360
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x36C
Haruka「So the real deal... truly is... the better one after all...?」%K%P

0x378
Makoto「...!! ... You knew... who Kurumi was...?」%K%P

0x384
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x390
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「You're wrong! Haruka, you're the one I love!」%K%P

0x3CC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3EC
Haruka「I'm so glad...」%K%P

0x3F8
Haruka「... I really... believed that you'd say that...」%K%P

0x404
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x410
Haruka「I thought that if it was you, then you'd say that.」%K%P

0x41C
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x428
Makoto「... Are you mad?」%K%P

0x434
Haruka「... No... I'm not.」%K%P

0x440
Makoto「I think that you made a misunderstanding about Kurumi%Nand I...」%K%P

0x454
Haruka「... Yes. I can see now that I was wrong.」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x46C
Haruka「When I saw Kurumi smiling like that with you in the room, my%Nhead went completely blank...」%K%P

0x478
Makoto「That's why I'm telling you you're wrong!」%K%P

0x484
Haruka「I know... But will you hear me out...? And so, I didn't know%Nwhat I should do. As I thought, I was no good at all...%Nbecause I'm not the real one...」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「HARUKA!」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「Didn't I tell you to never say that again!?」%K%P

0x4A8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x4B4
Her sincere gaze bores straight into me, as if she's%Ntrying to bring something to my attention.%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「... I looked for you...」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「... I looked for you... because I was worried to death%Nabout you...」%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「Because I don't want... to lose my most precious person...」%K%P

0x4E4
Haruka「... I'm alive, aren't I? Here...」%K%P

0x544
When she says that, Haruka takes my palm and pushes it%Nagainst her chest...%K%P

0x550
*Thump, thump*... *Thump, thump*...%K%N

0x55C
The sound of Haruka's heart is transmitted to my hand...%K%P

0x568
The echo of her life...%K%N

0x574
The trembling of her soul...%K%N

0x580
The proof... that she's alive...%K%P

0x58C
Haruka「What's wrong? Didn't you have a headache...?」%K%P

0x598
Haruka is playing dumb, making fun of me.%K%N

0x5A4
But she's not doing so out of ill will.%K%P

0x5B0
I know that.%K%N

0x5BC
Her heartbeat is telling me that.%K%P

0x5C8
Makoto「... So you really were the one... with the medicine.」%K%P

0x5D4
Haruka「I was outside when I was hit by the night wind. It then%Nstarted to rain... So I calmed down a bit... And then, I%Nrealized it... I... was jealous...」%K%P

0x5E0
Haruka「Since I didn't understand that concept until recently, I%Ndidn't know what to do with my own feelings... I didn't know%Nhow to handle my growing jealousy...」%K%P

0x5EC
Haruka「But, the rain taught me. Just as Makoto trusts me, I have%Nto trust Makoto...」%K%P

0x5F8
Haruka「I've changed since meeting you. I've understood that I%Ncan live as my own self.」%K%P

0x604
Haruka「So Kurumi and I are different, right? It's fine if I trust you,%Nright?」%K%P

0x610
Makoto「Yeah, that's right.」%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「Didn't I tell you on the pier?」%K%P

0x628
Makoto「'To me, you are the most important existence in the%Nwhole world, someone that can never be replaced by%Nanything'...」%K%P

0x634
Haruka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x66C
I embrace the cold, soaking wet Haruka in the pouring%Nrain.%K%P

0x678
My hands tremble as I feel the remaining sensation of%Nher heartbeat.%K%P

0x684
Right now, Haruka is within me.%K%N

0x690
Her heartbeat has engraved itself within me.%K%P

0x69C
A gentle light seems to begin driving away the darkness%Nbefore our eyes that wrapped us up...%K%P

0x6B8
... ... ...%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「Haruka, can I ask you something? Why is it that you love%Nrain... no, water so much?」%K%P

0x6E0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x6EC
Makoto「No, you don't need to force yourself to say it if you%Ndon't want to. I'm just a little curious...」%K%P

0x6F8
Haruka「... It's a bond.」%K%P

0x704
Makoto「A bond?」%K%P

0x710
Haruka「Yes, a bond... I remember almost nothing about my real%Nfather... But the only memory I have of him is us together%Nin the water once...」%K%P

0x71C
Haruka「No, it might just have been my father in the water, or just%Nme in the water. Anyway, that is the only vivid image of%Nhim I have within me...」%K%P

0x728
Makoto「Your father... and the... water.」%K%P

0x734
Haruka「So that's why... I love water. It's the only bond... between%Nme and my father.」%K%P

0x740
Makoto「Hey, don't forget that I'm also here now.」%K%P

0x74C
I tightly embrace Haruka.%K%P

0x758
Haruka「... I won't... I'm really happy...」%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「Well then, shall we head back then?」%K%P

0x800
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x814
We separate our bodies from each other, but make up%Nfor it by holding hands.%K%P

0x820
Haruka's small palm is covered in pleasantly cool,%Ncomfortable water.%K%P

0x82C
Just like that, we begin to walk towards the lodge...%K%P

0x844
Makoto「Ugh, it's cold...」%K%P

0x850
Makoto「If I get a cold from this, then I guess it's your fault, right?」%K%P

0x85C
A smile rises to my face while I make a sarcastic quip.%K%P

0x868
... Of course, I just said it as a joke...%K%P

0x874
But Haruka...%K%P

0x898
Haruka「*sniff*...」%K%P

0x8A4
... suddenly looks like she's about to cry.%K%P

0x8B0
Makoto「I-I'm sorry... It was just a joke! This isn't enough to make%Nme catch a cold!」%K%P

0x8BC
I hastily apologize to her...%K%P

0x8C8
Just then...%K%P

0x8DC
Haruka「Hee hee...」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x8F4
Haruka「Hee hee hee... I'm not crying.」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「A... Ah! That was cruel! When did you learn how to make%Ncrocodile tears!?」%K%P

0x914
Haruka「Well... It's. A. Secret.」%K%P

0x920
Makoto「Haruka... your personality seems to have changed%Nsomewhat...」%K%P

0x934
Haruka「You're the one who's changed, right?」%K%P

0x940
Me, huh...%K%N

0x94C
I instinctively smile.%K%P

0x958
Haruka「Ehee hee...♪」%K%P

0x96C
Haruka「Ahahahahahahahaha♪」%K%P

0x978
Our laughter begins to merge in the sound of the rainfall.%K%P

0x984
Although we're soaked to the bone and our bodies are%Nshivering from the cold, we are the happiest people in%Nthe world at this moment.%K%P

0x9A0
But...%K%P

0xA04
... ... ...%K%P

0xA78
Haruka「Ah, that puppy!」%K%P

0xA84
In that instant, I feel like I've been knocked down to the%Npits of hell.%K%P

0xA90
Hope changes into despair.%K%P

0xA9C
It's the second coming... of my previous... nightmare...%K%P

0xAF0
Down the road is Saki, frozen in place with an umbrella in%Nhand.%K%N

0xB04
The puppy then runs towards her at full speed.%K%P

0xB3C
A car approaches from the other side of the curve!%K%N

0xB48
A bright red car with its headlights lit...!%K%P

0xB54
The puppy feverishly runs without looking aside.%K%N

0xB60
It hasn't noticed the car! It can only see Saki, who's right%Nbefore its eyes!%K%P

0xB6C
—The sound of the car's horn pierces my eardrums!%K%P

0xB78
And at the same time, Haruka... Haruka...%K shakes off my%Nhand and starts running!!!%K

0x13C0
No! I've got to hold Haruka back!

0x13CC
I'll protect the puppy!

0xBC0
Makoto「Haruka, don't!」%K%P

0xBCC
Reflexively, I quickly stretch out my hand and grab%NHaruka's arm.%K%P

0xBE0
Haruka「But that puppy will...! I can't!!!」%K%P

0xBF4
—Haruka's shout pierces my ears.%K%P

0xC00
I unintentionally lessen the power in my hand...%K%P

0xC0C
In the next instant...%K%P

0xC18
Haruka shakes off my hand again and starts running!%K%P

0xC24
Makoto「—Haruka!」%K%P

0xC30
Haruka rushes over to the puppy, picks it up, and holds%Nit against her chest as if to protect it.%K%P

0xC3C
Immediately afterwards, the bright red frame of the car%Ndraws near her!%K%P

0xC48
Makoto「...!!!」%K%P

0xC5C
I can't just stand by and let the puppy die like this! On%Nthe other hand, there's no way that I can let Haruka%Nsacrifice herself either!%K%P

0xC68
Which means there's only one way left...%K%P

0xC74
I reflexively rush out onto the road.%K%P

0xC80
I get ahead of Haruka, and pick the puppy up in my arms%Nbefore she can.%K%P

0xC8C
Haruka「MAKOTO! NO!!!」%K%P

0xC98
Saki「KYAAAAAAA!!」%K%P

0xCA4
In the next instant...%K%N

0xEC8
... I am knocked aside from behind with great force!%K%P

0xEE0
I go rolling to the edge of the road while holding the%Npuppy against my chest.%K%P

0xEEC
I immediately lift my face, and shift my focus to the%Ncenter of the road...%K%P

0xEF8
Makoto「Ha... Haruka!!!」%K%P

0xF04
That's right... the one who pushed me away from behind%Nwas Haruka!%K%P

0xFD0
Saki「!!!!」%K%P

0xFF8
Saki places her hand over her mouth, frozen in place. I%Ncan't... move either.%K%P

0x1004
Saki and I are watching Haruka's body... which has been%Nsent flying...%K%P

0x1010
It all happens as if it's in slow motion. Haruka's body%Nslowly, slowly draws an arc in midair.%K%P

0x1068
Her slender body falls onto the asphalt face-up... as if%Nit's been thrown onto it.%K%P

0x1074
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1080
Saki「...」%K%P

0x108C
Time stops.%K%P

0x10C4
Haruka had firmly held the puppy against her chest, and%Nit's still there, completely unharmed.%K%P

0x10D0
The puppy slightly shakes its now soaked head, worms%Nits way out of Haruka's arms, and jumps off of her.%K%P

0x10DC
It starts to run over towards Saki's feet as if nothing%Nhappened...%K%P

0x10E8
Haruka's body is illuminated by the headlights, her pale%Nfigure sticking out in the downpour.%K%P

0x10FC
Haruka lies on the ground, not even twitching.%K%P

0x1108
Her body is illuminated by the headlights, her pale figure%Nsticking out in the downpour.%K%P

0x1114
The puppy slightly shakes its now soaked head, worms%Nits way out of my arms, and jumps off of me.%K%P

0x1120
It starts to run over towards Saki's feet as if nothing%Nhappened...%K%P

0x112C
My legs won't stop shaking.%K I can't move my stiffened%Nlimbs.%K%N

0x1138
Saki is also silently standing stock-still, oblivious to the%Nplayful puppy at her feet.%K%P

0x1144
Makoto「... Ha-Haru... ka...?」%K%P

0x1150
My voice has never trembled this much before in my life.%K%N

0x115C
Saki's eyes well with tears, and she slowly shakes her%Nhead back and forth.%K%P

0x1168
No way... This isn't... This isn't...%K%P

0x11C0
A red liquid on the asphalt catches my eye.%K%N

0x11CC
Blood... A large quantity of fresh red blood is pouring out%Nof Haruka's body.%K%P

0x11D8
It slowly begins to spread, soaking the already wet%Nasphalt...%K%P

0x11E4
Makoto「HARUKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!」%K%P

0x11F0
I wring out a loud scream from within my body.%K%P

0x11FC
I couldn't... protect Haruka...%K%P
