I suddenly notice Haruka, who's sitting on the steps of%Nthe slide.%K%P

0x50
She doesn't seem to be doing anything in particular%Nother than hugging her knees while gazing at the%Nsparkling sunlight reflecting off the pool's surface.%K%P

0x98
Makoto「Yo! What's up?」%K%P

0xA4
I call out to Haruka.%K%P

0xB0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xBC
She doesn't reply... Her eyes are glued on the the%Nwater's surface.%K%P

0xC8
Makoto「This is the water slide. Do you want to ride it too?」%K%P

0xD4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xE0
... Not a word. She seems so terribly focused.%K%P

0xEC
I follow suit and stare at the water.%K%P

0xF8
... There's nothing interesting or unusual about it.%K%P

0x104
Makoto「... Say, what are you looking at?」%K%P

0x110
I ask another question.%K%P

0x11C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x128
She's still looking at the water...%K%P

0x134
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x140
Makoto「... Say, Haruka. I don't see anything but water...」%K%P

0x14C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x158
Makoto「It couldn't be that you're just looking at the water, right?」%K%P

0x164
I try asking this, but even I think it's a stupid question.%NThere's no way she'd...%K%P

0x170
Haruka「... The water.」%K%P

0x17C
Haruka finally speaks. She's still fixated on the water's%Nsurface.%K%P

0x188
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x194
Haruka「I was looking... at the water...」%K%P

0x1A0
Haruka replies as if it's normal to do.%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1B8
I'm dumbfounded.%K%P

0x1C4
Could she be mocking me?%K

0x18A0
Act like I understand.

0x18AC
Ignore Haruka.

0x20C
Makoto「I see... You were looking at the water... Yeah... yeah, I get%Nit...」%K%P

0x218
For the time being, I try to act like I understand her.%K%P

0x224
However, I feel pretty bad about lying...%K%P

0x230
Haruka「I like... looking at the water...」%K%P

0x23C
She's still staring at it.%K%P

0x248
I observe her face.%K%P

0x254
She has a very apathetic expression.%K%P

0x260
I don't see any signs of her mocking me, however.%K%P

0x26C
Now that I think about it... I remember something.%K%P

0x278
Yesterday morning, she also stared at the water%Ndripping from that faucet.%K%P

0x294
She also soaked her bare feet in the waves on Princess%NBeach yesterday.%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2AC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2B8
The two of us fall silent again. This silence is getting%Nuncomfortable.%K%P

0x2C4
I want to as her "Why do you like water so much?"%K%P

0x2D0
... But I decide not to. At any rate, I don't think she'll%Nanswer me anyway.%K%P

0x2DC
I should change the topic.%K%P

0x2E8
I need to bring up a topic that'll interest Haruka.%K%P

0x2F4
... Umm, what topic would interest her... Mmm...%K%P

0x300
... Hmm?%K%P

0x30C
Then it hits me.%K%P

0x318
What topic would interest Haruka?%K%P

0x324
I can't think of anything... because I don't know anything%Nabout her yet, right?!%K%P

0x330
I should ask her questions about herself. Well, she might%Nnot answer me, but...%K%P

0x33C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x348
Well, it can't hurt to try!%K%P

0x354
If things stay this awkward, I'm going to suffocate to%Ndeath.%K%P

0x360
Makoto「Hey, Haruka?」%K%P

0x36C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x378
Like always, she doesn't turn to face me, but I know%Nshe's listening.%K%P

0x384
Well then, what should I try asking her...?%K

0x18B8
Comment on how she skipped a grade.

0x18C4
What do you do on your days off?

0x18D0
What are your favorite foods?

0x18DC
What's your type?

0x3F4
Makoto「Haruka... you're one year younger than us, right?」%K%P

0x418
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x424
She doesn't respond, but I continue to talk anyway.%K%P

0x430
Makoto「But you're in the same grade we are. ... So that means%Nyou've skipped a grade, right?」%K%P

0x43C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「Skipping a grade... that's amazing. Only top notch%Nstudents can accomplish that!」%K%P

0x454
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「Seriously, that's amazing. You're a year younger than%Nus, yet you're just as smart as we are... No, you might%Neven be smarter than us.」%K%P

0x46C
I keep saying "amazing."%K%P

0x478
Being praised makes everyone feel good.%K%P

0x484
With this, I feel that the mood has now lightened enough%Nfor us to talk normally...%K%P

0x490
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x49C
Haruka「... Is that rare?」%K%P

0x4A8
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x4B4
Haruka「Is that rare? Is that not normal?」%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「Ah... that's, umm...」%K%P

0x4CC
Her unexpected reply has left me at a loss for words.%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「... Hmm, well, I wouldn't call it normal...」%K%P

0x4E4
Haruka「I see...」%K%P

0x4F0
Makoto「Ah, but isn't that something to be proud of? Because it's%Nnot normal, it means you're not an ordinary human...」%K%P

0x4FC
I decided I had to follow up on that.%K%P

0x508
Haruka「It doesn't... matter to me.」%K%P

0x514
Makoto「Oh... I see...」%K%P

0x520
I kinda feel like I've suffered an magnificent, honorable%Ndefeat.%K%P

0x54C
... I'll change the topic.%K

0x18E8
What do you do on your days off?

0x18F4
What are your favorite foods?

0x1900
What's your type?

0x59C
Makoto「Haruka, what do you do on your days off?」%K%P

0x5C0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「The image I have of you is somewhat of an honor%Nstudent, but not one who's glued to her desk 24/7...」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「On the other hand, I can't see you doing sports...」%K%P

0x5E4
Makoto「And you don't really strike me as someone with a part%Ntime job either...」%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「... So, what is it that you really do?」%K%P

0x5FC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x608
Makoto「Ah... Umm... If you don't want to answer that, that's fine.」%K%P

0x614
There goes another failed attempt... As I'm about to%Nchange the subject, Haruka speaks.%K%P

0x620
Haruka「... I go home.」%K%P

0x62C
Makoto「... Home?」%K%P

0x638
Haruka「Right, home. ... Because I live at my dorm most of the time.」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「Ah... I see.」%K%P

0x650
Haruka「When I go home, I help my mother out...」%K%P

0x65C
Makoto「I see. You're great, Haruka.」%K%P

0x668
It feels like I'm praising a child.%K%P

0x674
Haruka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x680
Makoto「... Hmm?」%K%P

0x68C
Haruka「Makoto... do you like... your father and mother?」%K%P

0x698
Makoto「U-Umm...」%K%P

0x6A4
I'm bewildered by her sudden question.%K%P

0x6B0
How should I answer that?%K

0x190C
"I like them."

0x1918
"I don't really like them."

0x6F8
Makoto「Yeah, I like them.」%K%P

0x704
Those are my true feelings.%K%P

0x710
They occasionally have fights, and sometimes make me%Nfeel depressed,%K

0x71C
but they're my parents, and to me, are people who%Nshould be loved.%K%P

0x728
Makoto「People who hate their parents... well, they definitely%Nexist, but... I think most people who claim to hate their%Nparents still love them deep down, you know?」%K%P

0x734
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0x740
Makoto「What about you?」%K%P

0x74C
Haruka「... I also... like them.」%K%P

0x758
Haruka looks at me as she says this.%K%P

0x764
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x770
Haruka「... Because they... are my only bond.」%K%P

0x77C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x788
For some reason, I feel that I mustn't pry any further.%K%P

0x7B4
... I'll change the topic.%K

0x1924
Comment on how she skipped a grade.

0x1930
What are your favorite foods?

0x193C
What's your type?

0x804
Makoto「Hmm... I don't really like them.」%K%P

0x810
I don't really feel this way. I'm just embarrassed to admit%Nit.%K%P

0x81C
They sometimes drive me insane...%K%P

0x828
... But they're my parents, and to me, are people who%Nshould be loved.%K%P

0x834
Makoto「Well, I am grateful to them for a lot things, but sometimes, I%Nfeel they can be so irritating.」%K%P

0x840
Makoto「For example, I'm already 20 years old, but they still treat%Nme like I'm a kid. I wish they'd just cut it out.」%K%P

0x84C
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0x858
Makoto「Haruka, do you feel that way too?」%K%P

0x864
Haruka「... I... like them.」%K%P

0x870
Haruka looks at me as she speaks.%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「... I-I see.」%K%P

0x888
Haruka「... Because they... are my only bond.」%K%P

0x894
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8A0
I begin to feel extremely awkward.%K%P

0x8C4
... I'll change the topic.%K

0x1948
Comment on how she skipped a grade.

0x1954
What are your favorite foods?

0x1960
What's your type?

0x934
Makoto「I'm not really picky; I'll eat just about anything.」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「Still, I have some favorites.」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「What I'm trying to ask is, well, do you have any favorite%Nfoods?」%K%P

0x960
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x96C
Haruka silently lowers her head.%K%P

0x978
Makoto「Ah... what am I saying? If you don't want to answer, that's%Nfine...」%K%P

0x984
Haruka「Cabbage cores...」%K%P

0x990
She says this with her head still down.%K%P

0x99C
Makoto「... H-Huh?」%K%P

0x9A8
Haruka「Cabbage cores... are delicious.」%K%P

0x9B4
Haruka looks at me. There's no signs that she's joking.%K%P

0x9C0
Haruka「The day before yesterday... The day we arrived at the%Nlodge, Yuka made... yakisoba... It was quite salty.」%K%P

0x9CC
Makoto「So are you saying that there were cabbage cores in%Nthe yakisoba...?」%K%P

0x9D8
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x9E4
Makoto「I... I see...」%K%P

0x9F0
I'm a little shocked. I'm surprised that Haruka likes%Ncabbage cores... but I'm even more surprised that Yuka%Nactually cooked something edible.%K%P

0x9FC
If I had arrived at the lodge earlier that day, I might have%Nseen it too... I'm a bit disappointed.%K%P

0xA08
Makoto「Th-Then... what do you dislike?」%K%P

0xA14
Pretending to be calm, I ask her another question.%K%P

0xA20
Haruka「... Eggs and milk.」%K%P

0xA2C
Makoto「Huh, why's that?」%K%P

0xA38
Haruka「... Because they're gooey.」%K%P

0xA44
Makoto「Gooey?」%K%P

0xA50
Haruka「They make me feel sick...」%K%P

0xA6C
I find it strange how someone who can't drink their milk%Nand eat eggs can happily look at creatures like sea%Nroaches.%K%P

0xA78
Well, I guess those simply might be a part of her likes and%Ndislikes, but still...%K%P

0xA84
Makoto「You don't eat them at all...?」%K%P

0xA90
Haruka「... No.」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「You can't be picky. If you don't have eggs or milk, your%Nbody won't grow up big and...」%K%P

0xAA8
I abruptly stop talking.%K%P

0xAB4
What the hell am I saying? Haruka's a college student. I%Nwas treating her like a kid just now, wasn't I...?%K%P

0xAC0
I become kind of embarrassed, and look away from%NHaruka.%K%P

0xACC
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0xAD8
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0xAE4
Haruka「... I'll try to have them more often.」%K%P

0xAF0
Makoto「A-Ah... Yeah.」%K%P

0xAFC
I'm a little surprised by her declaration, but also pleased%Nthat she took my advice.%K%P

0xB20
... I'll change the topic.%K

0x196C
Comment on how she skipped a grade.

0x1978
What do you do on your days off?

0x1984
What's your type?

0xB88
Makoto「Haruka, what kind of guy is your type?」%K%P

0xB94
... Wait, isn't this question a little bit too personal?%K%P

0xBA0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xBAC
Of course she doesn't want to answer... That's only%Nnatural.%K%P

0xBB8
Makoto「Nevermind, sorry...」%K%P

0xBC4
I decide to change the topic.%K%P

0xBD0
Haruka「What about you...?」%K%P

0xBDC
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0xBE8
Haruka「Makoto, what's your type...?」%K%P

0xBF4
Wha...!!!%K%P

0xC00
I wasn't expecting this.%K%P

0xC0C
Makoto「Umm... Umm...」%K%P

0xC18
Haruka is waiting for my answer with a serious%Nexpression.%K%P

0xC24
I need to answer properly, or this could be bad...%K%P

0xC30
I answered.%K

0x1990
An active girl like Yuka

0x199C
A quiet girl like you

0x19A8
A determined girl like Saki

0x19B4
A sisterly girl like Kurumi

0x19C0
An adult woman like Izumi-san

0xCA0
Makoto「An active girl like Yuka... I guess?」%K%P

0xCAC
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0xCB8
Haruka replies in a mumbled voice.%K%P

0xCC4
Her expression is hard to read.%K%P

0xCE0
Makoto「A quiet girl like you... I guess?」%K%P

0xCEC
Haruka「... Like... me...?」%K%P

0xCF8
Haruka repeats my words.%K%P

0xD0C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xD18
She silently lowers her head.%K%P

0xD24
Her expression is hard to read.%K%P

0xD40
Makoto「A determined girl like Saki... I guess?」%K%P

0xD4C
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0xD58
Haruka replies in a mumbled voice.%K%P

0xD64
Her expression is hard to read.%K%P

0xD78
Makoto「A sisterly girl like Kurumi... I guess?」%K%P

0xD84
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0xD90
Haruka replies in a mumbled voice.%K%P

0xD9C
Her expression is hard to read.%K%P

0xDB0
Makoto「An adult woman like Izumi-san... I guess?」%K%P

0xDBC
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0xDC8
Haruka replies in a mumbled voice.%K%P

0xDD4
Her expression is hard to read.%K%P

0xDE0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xDEC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xDF8
The two of us are dead silent.%K%P

0xE04
Hmm. I guess it's time to move on to another topic.%K%P

0xE28
... I'll change the topic.%K

0x19CC
Comment on how she skipped a grade.

0x19D8
What do you do on your days off?

0x19E4
What are your favorite foods?

0xE88
Haruka「... Why?」%K%P

0xE94
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xEA8
Haruka「... Why are you so curious about me?」%K%P

0xEB4
She asks me this with a truly confused expression and%Nvoice.%K%P

0xEC0
Makoto「U... Umm, that's because...」%K%P

0xECC
I can't answer. The truth is, even I don't understand it%Nvery well myself.%K%P

0xED8
Haruka「Why?」%K%P

0xEE4
Haruka asks again.%K

0x19F0
Because I'm interested in you.

0x19FC
Because I like you.

0xF2C
Makoto「It's because... I'm interested in you.」%K%P

0xF38
Haruka「You're interested... in me?」%K%P

0xF44
Makoto「I want to know more about you, Haruka.」%K%P

0xF50
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xF64
I look at Haruka.%K%P

0xF70
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xF7C
I stare firmly into her eyes.%K%P

0xF90
Haruka「...!」%K%P

0xF9C
Flustered, she averts her gaze from me.%K%P

0xFA8
Though she's trying to hide it, Haruka is blushing...%K%P

0xFBC
Makoto「It's because... I like you.」%K%P

0xFC8
Like? I like Haruka?%K%P

0xFD4
Is that true?%K%P

0xFE0
Even though we're just acquaintances? Even though I%Nknow nothing about her?%K%P

0xFF4
Haruka「... 'Like'?」%K%P

0x1000
Makoto「Y... Yeah.」%K%P

0x100C
I nod before forcing myself to say this.%K%P

0x1018
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1024
Haruka lowers her head again.%K%P

0x1030
Makoto「Ah... Umm...」%K%P

0x103C
I'm on edge. Am I annoying her?%K%P

0x1048
Makoto「Ah... err... it was just a joke, ahahaha... don't take it%Nseriously.」%K%P

0x1054
I desperately try to smooth this over.%K%P

0x1060
Haruka「It was... a joke?」%K%P

0x106C
Makoto「Y... Yeah.」%K%P

0x1078
Haruka「I see... I'm glad...」%K%P

0x1084
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1090
As I thought, I was pestering her...%K%P

0x109C
I try to hide my shock.%K%P

0x10B0
Haruka「Because I don't know... The meaning of the word 'like'...」%K%P

0x10BC
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x10C8
Haruka「Because if someone told me they liked me, I wouldn't%Nknow... how to react...」%K%P

0x10D4
Haruka「Because if someone told me they liked me, I wouldn't%Nknow... what to think...」%K%P

0x10E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x10F4
We fall silent again.%K%P

0x1100
Once again, the atmosphere is awkward...%K%P

0x110C
Makoto「Hey, do you want to go on the slide?」%K%P

0x1118
For the time being, in order to break this deadlock%Nbetween us, I've got to act.%K%P

0x112C
Haruka「... The slide?」%K%P

0x1138
Makoto「See, this is the slide. You didn't notice?」%K%P

0x1144
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x1150
Makoto「Do you want to ride it?」%K%P

0x1164
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1170
She seems hesitant.%K%P

0x117C
Makoto「Let's do it! I know you're gonna love it, it feels great!」%K%P

0x1188
Haruka「Feels great...?」%K%P

0x1194
Makoto「Yeah, when you're sliding, you can't think about%Nanything...」%K%P

0x11A0
I keep on insisting, exaggerating it a little bit. No, scratch%Nthat, I'm really overexaggerating...%K%P

0x11AC
Haruka「Can't think... about anything...?」%K%P

0x11B8
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x11C4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x11D8
Haruka「Then I'll do it.」%K%P

0x11E4
Haruka answers clearly.%K%P

0x11F8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1204
Makoto「Haruka...? What's wrong?」%K%P

0x1210
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x121C
She's expressionless. ... No, would it be better to say%Nthat her expression has gone stiff?%K%P

0x1228
Makoto「Haruka... could it be that you're nervous?」%K%P

0x1234
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1240
She nods.%K%P

0x1254
Haruka「Hey...」%K%P

0x1260
Suddenly, Haruka grabs my hand, startling me.%K%P

0x126C
Haruka「Let's go on the slide together...」%K%P

0x1280
... ... ...%K%P

0x128C
In the end, it's come down to the two of us sliding%Ntogether.%K%P

0x12A0
Haruka sits down between my legs as I hold her from%Nbehind.%K%P

0x12AC
The warm water flowing from behind me feels pleasant%Nagainst my back.%K%P

0x12B8
But... at this rate...%K%P

0x12C4
Makoto「D-Don't you... think this is a little dangerous...?」%K%P

0x12D0
Haruka「It's all right... You're holding me tight enough...」%K%P

0x12DC
Makoto「No... that's not what I meant...」%K%P

0x12E8
Haruka「Let's go...!」%K%P

0x12F4
Makoto「W-Wait, not ye...!」%K%P

0x1300
But Haruka doesn't wait. We take a deep breath.%K%P

0x130C
As we ride the flowing water, we slide down with great%Nspeed.%K%P

0x1318
Haruka「!!...」%K%P

0x1324
Haruka can't help but shout.%K%P

0x1330
Makoto「...!!」%K%P

0x133C
I yell for a totally different reason.%K%P

0x1348
While Haruka is intoxicated by the exhilarating feeling of%Nsliding down, I don't share her sentiments.%K%P

0x1354
We're two adults on a water slide. The fact that we're%Npractically glued together as well causes me to feel%Nuneasy.%K%P

We finally reach the end point. Our bodies are flung into%Nthe pool's water.%K%P

0x1398
Makoto「Whew...」%K%P

0x13A4
Haruka turns towards me with water dripping from her%Nhead.%K%P

0x13B8
Makoto「... Ah!」%K%P

0x13C4
Haruka「Hee hee...」%K%P

0x13D0
What the... Haruka just smiled...%K%P

0x13DC
It was just a small grin, but I've never seen her smile like%Nthat before.%K%P

0x13E8
Haruka「Hey... one more time.」%K%P

0x13F4
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x1400
Haruka「Let's go... one more time.」%K%P

0x140C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1418
We took so many trips down the slide together that I lost%Ntrack.%K%P

0x1468
... ... ...%K%P

0x1474
Once I leave Haruka, I head over to the drink stand to%Nquench my thirst.%K%P

0x14F8
Yuka「Huh? Well, if it isn't Makoto.」%K%P

0x1504
Makoto「Oh... Yuka.」%K%P

0x1510
Yuka「You look kinda beat.」%K%P

0x151C
Makoto「Y... Yeah. I was riding on the slide together with Haruka...」%K%P

0x1528
Yuka「Huh...?」%K%P

0x1534
I tell Yuka what we were doing just now.%K%P

0x1540
Yuka「Hmm, that sounds kinda childish.」%K%P

0x154C
Makoto「Agreed. Perhaps this is the first time Haruka's ever been%Non a slide?」%K%P

0x1558
Yuka「Wrong, wrong... I was talking about you.」%K%P

0x1564
Makoto「Huh? Me? Why?」%K%P

0x1570
Yuka「Because weren't you the one who invited her in the first%Nplace? You're 20 years old, and yet you're doing things%Nthat only kids do.」%K%P

0x157C
Makoto「Ugh...!」%K%P

0x1588
I have no comeback. Certainly, what I did was pretty%Nchildish...%K%P

0x1594
Yuka「Anyway, are you thirsty? It's on me.」%K%P

0x15A0
Makoto「Oh! Looks like I got lucky! Thank you very much!」%K%P

0x15B4
(This is no good...)%K%P

0x15C0
I'll just ignore Haruka for now. It's extremely unlikely I can%Nhold up a conversation with her anyway.%K%P

0x15CC
Makoto「Haruka... I'm going on the slide now.」%K%P

0x15D8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x15E4
With those final words, I run up the stairs to the slide.%K%P

0x1608
... ... ...%K%P

0x1614
Whooooosh...%K%P

0x163C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1648
I went on the slide, but for some reason, it wasn't as fun%Nas I thought it'd be.%K%P

0x1654
Even though it was much more fun when I was a kid...%K%P

0x1660
Makoto「That's enough... I'll go now.」%K%P

0x166C
I head over to the drink stand to quench my thirst.%K%P

0x16A8
Yuka「Huh? Well, if it isn't Makoto.」%K%P

0x16B4
Makoto「Oh... Yuka.」%K%P

0x16C0
Yuka「Anyway, are you thirsty? It's on me.」%K%P

0x16CC
Makoto「Oh! Looks like I got lucky! Thank you very much!」%K%P
