After that, we left the barbecue in a cheerful mood, and%Nreturned to the lodge.%K%P

0x90
We were reluctant to break up at Princess Beach and%Nend the party...%K%P

0x9C
Izumi「Well then, why don't we all go to the lodge and play%Ncards?」%K%P

0xA8
...So we decided to accept Izumi-san's proposal.%K%P

0xB4
We had played so many rounds of seven bridge that we%Nlost track of time. In the end, everyone got tired and fell%Nasleep past two in the morning...%K%P

0xC0
As usual, Haruka's in her own room, and Okuhiko is%Nsleeping up in the loft.%K%P

0xCC
After the game was over, Saki returned to her summer%Nhouse alone while rubbing her sleepy eyelids.%K%P

0xD8
Truth be told, it seems she'd wanted to stay overnight%Nat the lodge with everyone, but unfortunately, there%Nwasn't enough room for her to sleep.%K%P

0xE4
Izumi-san is using the living room sofa, while Kurumi-chan%Ntook Makoto's bed.%K%P

0xF0
Makoto doesn't even have a place to sleep.%K%P

0xFC
So for tonight, he's sleeping on the hard floor...%K%P

0x108
As for me...%K%P

0x178
I'm next to Makoto right now.%K%P

0x184
We're sitting on the floor of his room, our backs leaning%Nagainst the wall.%K%P

0x190
Kurumi is sleeping soundly in front of us, breathing%Nquietly.%K%P

0x19C
We're gazing at her peaceful sleeping face.%K%P

0x1A8
Yuka「But aren't you glad?」%K%P

0x1B4
I whisper this without taking an eye off of Kurumi's face.%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「About what?」%K%P

0x1CC
Yuka「About Kurumi-chan!」%K%P

0x1D8
Yuka「She played cards with us the whole time.」%K%P

0x1E4
Yuka「We didn't have to specifically watch out for her that way,%Nright?」%K%P

0x1F0
Makoto「Well, yeah...」%K%P

0x1FC
Yuka「Judging from her sleeping face, I'm sure she won't wake%Nup until morning...」%K%P

0x208
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x214
Yuka「And we haven't gone back to that shrine this whole time,%Nright?」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「That's right...」%K%P

0x22C
Yuka「Feels like a 'happily ever after' is coming our way.」%K%P

0x238
Makoto「Hey... say what you like, but don't you think it's too early%Nto feel that way?」%K%P

0x244
Yuka「Really?」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x25C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x268
Makoto「Just to be safe, why don't you stay with me tomorrow%Nnight?」%K%P

0x27C
Yuka「You don't... trust me...」%K%P

0x288
Makoto「It's not like that, but...」%K%P

0x294
Yuka「Then what is it like?」%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「...I told you, it's just to be safe!」%K%P

0x2B4
Yuka「So you really don't trust me...」%K%P

0x2C0
He doesn't trust me...%K When I think that, a dull pain hurts%Nmy heart.%K%P

0x2CC
Makoto「Just hold it right there...」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「How can you expect me to trust you when you were the%None who broke our promise on the last 6th in the first%Nplace?」%K%P

0x2E4
Yuka「That was...」%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「'Don't come here ever again'...Even though you said that%Nin front of the shrine...」%K%P

0x314
And then, Makoto seems to be taken aback by his own%Nwords, as he gasps in understanding.%K%P

0x320
Makoto「Say, Yuka...? I still haven't heard it, have I?」%K%P

0x32C
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x338
Makoto「Your reason for wanting to go back to the past...」%K%P

0x344
(...!!)%K%P

0x358
Yuka「...But... that's alread—」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「I don't even know what it is...」%K%P

0x370
Makoto「You never even... told me...」%K%P

0x37C
Yuka「I'm telling you, it doesn't-」%K%P

0x388
Makoto「Even so...」%K%P

0x394
Makoto「Even so...」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Even so, there's no way I can trust you!」%K%P

0x3AC
Makoto「I don't know your reason at all!」%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「I have no guarantee that you won't go!!」%K%P

0x3C4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3D0
In my mind... that scene passes by...%K%P

0x3E4
Kurumi「Mmm... Mmm...」%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto's shouting causes Kurumi-chan to turn in her%Nbed.%K%P

0x404
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x410
Yuka「You're horrible... Makoto...」%K%P

0x41C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x428
Yuka「I get it... I get it...」%K%P

0x434
Yuka「I'll tell you everything...」%K%P

0x448
I say this, and slowly get up.%K%P

0x454
Yuka「I don't... want to wake Kurumi-chan...」%K%P

0x47C
I quietly leave the room.%K%P

0x488
Makoto follows right after me...%K%P

0x510
I sit down in the center of the short staircase that leads%Nto the terrace.%K%P

0x51C
Makoto slowly sits down next to me.%K%P

0x528
The biting cold night wind nips at my ears.%K%P

0x534
I'm cold...%K But it's not entirely the wind's fault.%K%P

0x548
The stars filling the night sky emit a cool and clear%Nradiance.%K%P

0x554
It's the same sky as that day...%K%P

0x560
The stars continue to endlessly shine.%K%P

0x56C
It's as if they're resonating with my still unhealed pain...%K%P

0x578
Before long, I purse my lips, and cut away the last of my%Nhesitation.%K%P

0x5B8
I quietly gaze at Makoto... and with a soft voice, I start%Nsincerely explaining everything to him.%K%P

0x5C4
Yuka「I...」%K%P

0x5D0
Yuka「I wanted to go back to the past... no matter what...」%K%P

0x5DC
Yuka「I realized it on the night of the 5th...」%K%P

0x5E8
Yuka「You and I went to the shrine... and talked about time%Ntravel...」%K%P

0x5F4
Yuka「After that, even when I returned to my room, I couldn't get%Nit out of my head the whole time...」%K%P

0x600
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x60C
Yuka「I turned in my bed countless times... and just when I%Nfinally felt like I was going to fall asleep... I suddenly%Nrealized it...」%K%P

0x618
Yuka「The meaning of those words...」%K%P

0x624
Yuka「The meaning of the words... written on the talisman...」%K%P

0x630
"The spring rain/ At the end of the cape/ Together with/%NThe ringing bell/ Will free you from time".%K%P

0x63C
Yuka「And before I realized it, it was pouring rain outside...」%K%P

0x648
Yuka「I headed for the end of the cape... while feeling the cold%Nsensation of the bell in my pocket with my fingertips...」%K%P

0x654
Yuka「I thought that if I did that, I'd surely return...」%K%P

0x660
Yuka「Because I wanted... to go back... to that time...」%K%P

0x66C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x678
Yuka「The first boy I loved...」%K%P

0x684
Yuka「He told me he loved me...」%K%P

0x690
Yuka「But even so, I... I...」%K%P

0x69C
Yuka「I still haven't told him...」%K%P

0x6A8
Yuka「I never told that boy my own feelings...」%K%P

0x6B4
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0x6C0
Makoto「Don't tell me that you...」%K%P

0x6CC
Yuka「...I wanted to tell him I love him!」%K%P

0x6D8
Yuka「I needed to tell him that no matter what!」%K%P

0x6E4
Yuka「If I didn't... If I didn't, I...」%K%P

0x6F0
Makoto「For that purpose...」%K%P

0x6FC
Makoto「The only reason you did it was for that purpose...?」%K%P

0x708
Yuka「But that's already-」%K%P

0x714
Makoto「Don't screw with me!」%K%P

0x720
Makoto「Then you're telling me that the only reason we're, no, I've%Ncontinued to be toyed with like this is because of your%Nselfish emotions!?」%K%P

0x72C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x738
Makoto「These past ten days... No, it could be ten years or a%Nhundred years for all I know...」%K%P

0x744
Makoto「For that whole time, we've been stuck like this because%Nof you recklessly acting upon such ridiculous and%Nchildish emotions!」%K%P

0x750
Yuka「You're wrong...」%K%P

0x75C
Makoto「Wrong? WRONG!? Then why don't you try telling me what%Nthe fuck I'm wrong about, then!?」%K%P

0x768
Yuka「That's...」%K%P

0x774
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x780
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x78C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x798
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x7A4
Makoto「I get it... That's enough...」%K%P

0x7B0
Makoto「That's enough... Nothing matters right now...」%K%P

0x7BC
Makoto「...What the hell...」%K%P

0x7C8
Makoto「...I've had enough...」%K%P

0x7DC
Makoto stands up while shaking his head.%K%P

0x7E8
His shoulders slouch...%K He stares off into space, not%Nlooking at anything.%K%P

0x7F4
He staggers up the stairs.%K%P

0x800
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x80C
I speak up as he ascends the stairs with unsteady feet.%K%P

0x828
However, Makoto ignores me as he silently disappears%Ninto the lodge...%K%P

0x8BC
I stare at the dark ceiling in my room while lying on the%Nbed.%K%P

0x8C8
I can't see the stars in this pitch black room.%K%P

0x8D4
It's quiet...%K%P

0x8E0
The only sound that reaches my ears is the ticking of%Nthe clock, reminding me of the passing time.%K%P

0x8EC
Darkness and silence...%K%P

0x8F8
While wrapped up in both, several scenes run through%Nmy head.%K%P

0x904
...%K%P

0x918
"If I could have one wish granted..."%K%P

0x924
—In the past, I would always think about that "what if".%K%P

0x930
"I want to go back to that time once more."%K%P

0x93C
—The past me wished that.%K%P

0x948
In order to grant the unfulfilled desire I've held for a long%Ntime.%K%P

0x954
...%K%P

0x9C4
Saki「Are you... over him? That boy, I mean...」%K%P

0xA0C
I'm not over him...%K I'm really not all right about it...%K%P

0xA18
I still haven't broken free of it.%K%P

0xA24
Quite the contrary; it's tied me down.%K To the past, to that%Ntime.%K%P

0xA30
For a long, long time... I've been trying... to forget it.%K%P

0xA3C
Yuka「...I wanted to tell him I love him!」%K%P

0xA48
Yuka「I needed to tell him no matter what!」%K%P

0xA54
That is my one, eternal wish.%K%P

0xA60
...%K%P

0xAC8
Makoto「Then you're telling me that the only reason we're, no, I've%Ncontinued to be toyed with like this is because of your%Nselfish emotions!?」%K%P

0xAD4
Makoto「These past ten days... no, it could be ten years or a%Nhundred years for all I know...」%K%P

0xAE0
Makoto「For that whole time, we've been stuck like this because%Nof you recklessly acting upon such ridiculous and%Nchildish emotions!」%K%P

0xAEC
To tell the person you love that you love them.%K I also%Nwanted to tell him those words.%K%P

0xAF8
Was it really that bad of a thing to do?%K%P

0xB04
Gradually, I begin to question it more and more...%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「For that purpose...」%K%P

0xB1C
Makoto「The only reason you did it was for that purpose...?」%K%P

0xB28
Yuka「You're wrong...」%K%P

0xB34
Makoto「Wrong? WRONG!? Then why don't you tell what the fuck I'm%Nwrong about, then!?」%K%P

0xB40
That's...%K That's...%K%P

0xB4C
It might actually be a bad thing...%K%P

0xB70
...%K%P

0xB7C
"If I could have one wish granted."%K%P

0xB88
—In the past, I would always think about that "what if".%K%P

0xB94
—What does the current me wish for?%K%P

0xBE4
...%K%P

0xBF0
As I'm gradually being lulled into sleep, I recall the night I%Nsaw the shooting star with Makoto...%K%P

0xCDC
??「Yuka... Yuka...!」%K%P

0xCE8
I hear someone calling my name...%K%P

0xCF4
Yuka「Hmm? ...Mmm...」%K%P

0xD00
??「If you don't get up soon, you'll be late, right?」%K%P

0xD0C
—L-Late!?%K%P

0xD40
Once I realize the meaning of those words, I jump to my%Nfeet, startled.%K%P

0xD74
I make out Haruka in my still hazy vision.%K%P

0xD9C
Yuka「Haruka...?」%K%P

0xDA8
Haruka「...Good morning.」%K%P

0xDC4
Yuka「Mmm... good morning...」%K%P

0xDD0
I do my hair up as I say this.%K%P

0xDDC
Yuka「...Why would I be late?」%K%P

0xDE8
Haruka「Because it's already the promised time...」%K%P

0xDF4
The clock's hands are already point at 11:00 A.M.%K%P

0xE00
Haruka「We made a promise last night, didn't we?」%K%P

0xE0C
Haruka「That we'd go to Lunabeach for lunch.」%K%P

0xE20
Yuka「...Is that right?」%K%P

0xE2C
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0xE38
I don't remember that at all.%K%P

0xE4C
Haruka「Okuhiko has to treat us too... so why don't we hurry up%Nand go?」%K%P

0xE60
Yuka「Okuhiko-kun is?」%K%P

0xE6C
Haruka「Because of what happened when we played seven%Nbridge yesterday.」%K%P

0xE78
Now that I think about it, didn't we make some kind of bet%Nyesterday at seven bridge...?%K%P

0xE84
It seems the bet was about today's lunch.%K%P

0xE90
Yuka「And Okuhiko-kun lost?」%K%P

0xEA4
Haruka「You don't remember...?」%K%P

0xEB8
Yuka「No, not really... I was drunk, you see.」%K%P

0xEC4
Haruka「Hmm...」%K%P

0xED0
The truth is, I was worried about Kurumi, so I wasn't really%Npaying attention to what was happening...%K%P

0xEDC
Haruka「Come on, let's get ready...」%K%P

0xEF0
Yuka「Ah... umm... I'm sorry, but...」%K%P

0xEFC
Haruka「???」%K%P

0xF08
Yuka「I'll pass...」%K%P

0xF1C
Haruka「Huh? Why?」%K%P

0xF28
Yuka「Well, that's...」%K%P

0xF34
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xF48
Yuka「...because I have a hangover...」%K%P

0xF5C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xF68
Haruka lets out a light sigh.%K%P

0xF74
Haruka「...I see. So you and Makoto won't be coming.」%K%P

0xF88
Yuka「...Makoto too?」%K%P

0xF9C
Haruka「He wouldn't wake up... no matter how many times I called%Nhis name.」%K%P

0xFA8
Haruka「So Okuhiko said to leave him.」%K%P

0xFB4
Yuka「So that's it...」%K%P

0xFC0
Haruka「Well then, we'll be going now...」%K%P

0xFD4
When I nod, Haruka slowly walks towards the door.%K%P

0xFF8
And the moment she grabs the doorknob, she turns%Naround as if she's remembered something.%K%P

0x100C
Haruka「...It'd be best if you washed your face quickly.」%K%P

0x1018
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x102C
Haruka「Because you've got tearstains left on it...」%K%P

0x10C0
After I change my clothes, brush my teeth, and wash my%Nface, I sit down on the living room sofa.%K%P

0x10CC
The sky I see from the window is different than%Nyesterday's, covered in dense clouds.%K%P

0x10D8
Just as Izumi-san said, it'll rain heavily tonight...%K%P

0x10E4
Everything is the same as last time.%K%P

0x10F0
There's just one difference...%K%P

0x10FC
...Makoto isn't beside me.%K%P

0x116C
...%K%P

0x1178
Makoto had woken up around this time.%K%P

0x1184
Makoto「G-Good morning...」%K%P

0x1190
He had made an awkward greeting.%K%P

0x11A4
Yuka「What's with that, Makoto? Are you still half asleep?」%K%P

0x11B8
Yuka「Shall we get ready and go?」%K%P

0x11CC
And then we headed out to Lunabeach...%K%P

0x121C
...%K%P

0x1228
The ocean is a drab grey color, reflecting the cloudy%Nsky.%K%P

0x1234
It mirrors the color of my heart right now.%K%P

0x1240
White would be too cheerful.%K On the other hand, black is%Ntoo gloomy...%K So it's grey.%K%P

0x124C
Yuka「Haah...」%K%P

0x1258
I sigh deeply, and head over to the kitchen.%K%P

0x1264
For now, I'll try to cook something in order to cheer%Nmyself up, even if it's only a little bit.%K%P

0x1270
(I'm pretty sure that we have eggs, tomatoes, and corn%Nbeef in the fridge...)%K%P

0x127C
It's been a long time since I've cooked, so I'm worried%Nthat my skills have dulled.%K%P

0x12D8
After I finish eating, I sit on a dining chair while spacing%Nout.%K%P

0x12E4
There's nothing to do...%K%P

0x12F0
On the table in front of me is some after-lunch coffee I%Nplaced there.%K%P

0x1328
The cuckoo clock in the living room chirps once.%K%P

0x1334
...It seems it's 1:00 P.M.%K%P

0x135C
I slowly take the origami cat out of my pocket.%K%P

0x1370
I slowly take the cat keychain out of my pocket.%K%P

0x137C
My gaze shifts from the cat to the door leading to%NMakoto's room.%K%P

0x1388
There's no sign that he'll rise soon.%K%P

0x13A4
Is he planning on sleeping forever...?%K%P

0x13B0
But if he does come out of his room, then what kind of%Nface should I show him?%K What words should I use?%K%P

0x13BC
Should I give him a wide smile and say "Good morning"?%K ...%NOr...%K Should I give him an apologetic glance and say%N"Sorry"?%K%P

0x13C8
At that time, what face would Makoto make?%K What words%Nwould he respond with?%K%P

0x13D4
...%K%P

0x13E0
I've filled my stomach, but my heart is still empty...%K%P

0x1444
...My head is slumped on the table.%K%P

0x1450
It seems like I'd dozed off when I wasn't paying attention...%K%P

0x145C
I take a sip of the coffee.%K%P

0x1468
It's now completely cold, having lost all its flavor.%K%P

0x1474
...%K%P

0x14AC
I hear the sound of a clang.%K%P

0x14B8
I look towards Makoto's room by reflex.%K%P

0x14C4
The door slowly begins to open, as if it were in slow%Nmotion...%K%P

0x14D0
The one who comes out is...%K%P

0x14E4
...Saki...?%K%P

0x14F8
Why did Saki...%K Come here...%K%P

0x1504
...%K%P

0x1510
...%K%P

0x151C
... ...Huh!?%K%P

0x1528
(Wh-Why is Saki coming out of there!?!?)%K%P

0x153C
My eyes meet Saki's.%K%P

0x1548
She looks unusually solemn...%K%P

0x1554
She then quietly walk over to me.%K%P

0x157C
My heart beats loudly, like a drum.%K%P

0x1588
...%K%P

0x15D0
Saki「Good morning.」%K%P

0x15FC
Yuka「G-Good morning...」%K%P

0x1608
Saki「Has your hangover cleared up?」%K%P

0x161C
Yuka「Y... Yes. Completely...」%K%P

0x1628
Feeling awkward, I avert my gaze from Saki's eyes.%K%P

0x1634
Saki「I see...」%K%P

0x1640
Saki「Then do you mind if we talk for a bit?」%K%P

0x164C
I give her a stiff nod.%K%P

0x1660
Saki sits down next to me.%K%P

0x166C
The sweet scent wrapped around her lingers in the air.%K%P

0x1680
Saki「You're probably wondering what I'm doing here, huh?」%K%P

0x168C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1698
Saki「I heard about it from Haruka-chan at Lunabeach...」%K%P

0x16A4
Saki「She said, 'Makoto and Yuka are acting strange'.」%K%P

0x16B0
Saki「The two of you were so cheerful yesterday, so for you%Nto suddenly be absent was definitely strange.」%K%P

0x16BC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x16C8
Saki「I was worried, so I came here, and found Makoto-kun still%Nin bed at this time.」%K%P

0x16D4
Saki「Yuka, you also seem kinda depressed.」%K%P

0x16E0
Yuka「I'm... I'm not depre-」%K%P

0x16F4
Saki「You're lying.」%K%P

0x1708
Yuka「W-Why do you...」%K%P

0x1714
Saki「You didn't look me in the eyes.」%K%P

0x1728
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1734
Saki「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x1740
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x174C
Saki「Did you have a fight?」%K%P

0x1758
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x176C
Saki「No comment again, huh...」%K%P

0x1780
Yuka「I'm telling you, it's nothing!」%K%P

0x178C
Saki「That's also a lie.」%K%P

0x17A0
Saki「Geez, you and Makoto-kun are such poor liars.」%K%P

0x17AC
Saki「It's really easy to see through you.」%K%P

0x17C0
Yuka「You think so...?」%K%P

0x17CC
Saki「Of course! You haven't changed at all since middle%Nschool.」%K%P

0x17D8
Saki「You haven't taken a single step forward since that time.」%K%P

0x17E4
(That ...time ... )%K%P

0x17F0
Saki「Didn't I ask you before?」%K%P

0x17FC
Saki「'Are you over him?'」%K%P

0x1808
Saki「The truth is, you're not over him at all, nor are you okay,%Nare you?」%K%P

0x1814
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1820
Saki「Ever since then, you've been acting strange.」%K%P

0x182C
Saki「Makoto-kun also seems to be depressed...」%K%P

0x1838
(Ma ...koto ... )%K%P

0x1844
Saki「When I questioned Makoto-kun about it, all he had to say%Nwas this.」%K%P

0x1850
Saki「'It has nothing to do with you, Saki!'」%K%P

0x185C
Saki「Those two really are spitting images.」%K%P

0x1868
Saki「Yuka...」%K%P

0x1874
Saki「...I loved that boy.」%K%P

0x1898
Yuka「...!」%K%P

0x18AC
Saki「Oh? Your face tells me that you want to say something.」%K%P

0x18B8
Saki「If there's something you want to say, then why don't you%Njust spit it out?」%K%P

0x18CC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x18E0
Saki「If it's about Makoto-kun and that boy, then I think you%Nshould definitely say it.」%K%P

0x18EC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x18F8
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1904
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1910
Saki「Hmm?」%K%P

0x191C
Yuka「Saki...」%K%P

0x1928
Yuka「Saki... do you...」%K%P

0x1934
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1940
Yuka「Do you... like Makoto?」%K%P

0x194C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1958
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1964
...%K%P

0x1970
The long silence continues as Saki thinks for what%Nseems to be forever.%K%P

0x197C
Before long, Saki slowly opens her mouth...%K%P

0x1988
Saki「I do.」%K%P

0x199C
Yuka「—!!!」%K%P

0x19A8
...I instinctively gasp.%K%P

0x19B4
It feels like someone has tightly grabbed my heart and is%Nsqueezing it...%K%P

0x19C0
As if all the blood in my body is flowing backwards...%K%P

0x19CC
...It's that kind of feeling.%K%P

0x19D8
I was expecting this, but... it's still shocking.%K%P

0x19EC
Saki「But...」%K%P

0x19F8
Saki casts down her gaze.%K%P

0x1A04
Saki「But it might be a little different than the normal definition%Nof 'like'...」%K%P

0x1A10
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x1A1C
Saki「Would you call it 'projection'...? Mmm, that's not right%Neither...」%K%P

0x1A30
Yuka「...I don't really understand what you're saying...」%K%P

0x1A3C
Saki「I know... I can't explain it very well with the way I'm talking%Nnow.」%K%P

0x1A48
Saki「Then I'll just talk about everything one piece at a time...」%K%P

0x1A54
She takes in a deep breath, and slowly exhales...%K%P

0x1A8C
Saki leans back on her chair, and stares into space.%K%P

0x1A98
It's as if her mind is running back to the far off, distant%Npast...%K%P

0x1AC8
Saki「Just like you...」%K%P

0x1AD4
Saki「Just like you, I also loved that boy.」%K%P

0x1AE0
Saki「I don't remember how it started.」%K%P

0x1AEC
Saki「Did I yearn for his unbound, free lifestyle...?」%K%P

0x1AF8
Saki「Or maybe it's because he had a lot of things I didn't...」%K%P

0x1B04
Saki「But...」%K%P

0x1B10
Saki「But... that boy loved you...」%K%P

0x1B1C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1B30
Saki「It was frustrating, but... the fact remained that there was%Nnothing I could do about it...」%K%P

0x1B3C
She says this with a faint voice as she hangs her head...%K%P

0x1B50
Saki「Before long, time passed... and I met Makoto-kun here.」%K%P

0x1B5C
Saki「I told you this before, but what Makoto-kun said was the%Nexact same thing that boy said.」%K%P

0x1B68
Saki「And then, I realized Makoto-kun had begun to captivate%Nme.」%K%P

0x1B74
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1B80
Saki「But I was uneasy.」%K%P

0x1B8C
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x1B98
Saki「Because Makoto-kun also might have already loved%Nsomeone else...」%K%P

0x1BA4
Saki「I didn't want to feel like I did last time...」%K%P

0x1BB0
Saki「So I decided to try confirming it during the Test of%NCourage.」%K%P

0x1BBC
Yuka「...So when you were talking about 'confirming' on that%Nday...?」%K%P

0x1BC8
Saki「Yes, that's right.」%K%P

0x1BD4
Saki「Just before we made pairs, I made a secret deal with%NMakoto-kun...」%K%P

0x1BE0
Yuka「A secret deal?」%K%P

0x1BEC
Saki「In other words...」%K%P

0x1C00
Saki explains that they planned to release the same%Nhand during Rock-Paper-Scissors, so that way they%Nwould definitely become a pair.%K%P

0x1C0C
So that's what those two were talking about on the way%Nto the Test of Courage...%K%P

0x1C58
Saki「When the Test of Courage began and after the two of us%Nleft, I first thought I'd try bringing up the story of that%Nboy.」%K%P

0x1C64
Saki「I wanted him to know about just that in advance before I%Nbegan talking about anything...」%K%P

0x1C70
Saki「Well, he already knew anyway.」%K%P

0x1C7C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1C88
Saki「But... during the Test of Courage, you interfered...」%K%P

0x1C94
Yuka「Huh? I... interfered?」%K%P

0x1CB8
Saki「You suddenly started screaming, so we came running%Nover to you.」%K%P

0x1CC4
Yuka「Hmm, did I really...?」%K%P

0x1CD0
Saki「Even if you don't remember it, that's how it went down!」%K%P

0x1CE4
Saki「Then after that, Makoto-kun said he wasn't going to the%Nhot springs...」%K%P

0x1CF0
Saki「I also had business to attend to, so I had to give up for%Nthat day...」%K%P

0x1CFC
Saki「...And so, I attempted to try again at the barbecue%Nyesterday.」%K%P

0x1D64
Saki「I think it was just about past 8:00.」%K%P

0x1D70
Saki「It was when the party was reaching the climax...」%K%P

0x1D84
Saki「It seemed like you and Makoto-kun were considerably%Ndrunk...」%K%P

0x1D90
Saki「And so I thought 'This is my chance!'」%K%P

0x1D9C
Saki「You couldn't tell at all what was going on around you.」%K%P

0x1DA8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1DB4
Saki「And besides, you know what they say: 'In vino veritas'.」%K%P

0x1DC0
Saki「That's why I decided to pretend to be drunk, and%Ngrabbed Makoto.」%K%P

0x1DCC
Saki「And then I said 'If I said I liked you, what would you do?'.」%K%P

0x1DD8
Yuka「...A-And then...?」%K%P

0x1DE4
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1DF0
Saki「He made a troubled face, then went deep in thought...」%K%P

0x1DFC
Saki「...And then, his face grew serious, and he said this...」%K%P

0x1E08
"I already have someone I love..."%K%P

0x1E14
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1E20
Saki「And on top of that, he said one more thing, as if to%Nsmooth things over.」%K%P

0x1E2C
Saki「'If you had asked me that before the Seminar Camp had%Nbegun, my answer might have been different,'...」%K%P

0x1E38
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1E44
Saki「However, he most likely doesn't remember saying that%Nanymore...」%K%P

0x1E94
Saki「...I was quite shocked...」%K%P

0x1EA0
Saki「It was as if that boy was the one who said that...」%K%P

0x1EAC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1EC0
Saki「But you know what? I was engulfed by the cheerful%Natmosphere around me, and before I knew it, the pain%Ngradually went away...」%K%P

0x1ECC
Saki「After that... I thought about it that night, and I realized it...」%K%P

0x1EE0
...Her eyes lower, and she clenches her hands into fists.%K%P

0x1EEC
Saki「I ...didn't love Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x1EF8
Yuka「Why do you say that...?」%K%P

0x1F0C
Saki「To 'like' someone has many different meanings.」%K%P

0x1F18
Saki「How do I put it...」%K%P

0x1F24
Saki「For example, in Japanese, the word 'suki' can mean to%N'like' or 'love'. It's like the difference between those two.」%K%P

0x1F30
Yuka「Like and love...?」%K%P

0x1F3C
Saki「...I'm sorry. It seems like I can't explain it well after all.」%K%P

0x1F50
Saki「But you know...」%K%P

0x1F5C
Saki「This was all because I didn't understand something from%Nthe beginning...」%K%P

0x1F68
Saki「As time passes... and you get older...」%K%P

0x1F7C
Saki「...You meet a lot more people, don't you? You can fall in%Nlove more than once, can't you?」%K%P

0x1F88
Saki「And so, I finally understand...」%K%P

0x1F94
Saki「What 'love' is.」%K%P

0x1FA0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1FAC
...Are those words her true feelings...?%K%P

0x1FB8
My eyelids faintly tremor and I become uneasy...%K%P

0x1FC4
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1FD0
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x1FDC
Yuka「But Saki, you... loved that boy, right?」%K%P

0x1FE8
Saki「...Yes.」%K%P

0x1FF4
Yuka「And... you see Makoto as his spitting image in all except%Nappearance...」%K%P

0x2008
Saki「...That's right.」%K%P

0x2014
Yuka「Then...!」%K%P

0x2028
Saki「Hey, Yuka? Do you know about lilacs?」%K%P

0x2034
Yuka「Lilacs...?」%K%P

0x2040
...It's the flower used in Saki's perfume.%K%P

0x204C
"By the way, Saki-chan, is that perfume you're using%Nlilac?"%K%P

0x2058
Izumi-san said that yesterday.%K%P

0x2064
It's a spring flower, and it's the sweet scent that's been%Nemanating from Saki...%K%P

0x2078
Saki「I love purple lilacs very much...」%K%P

0x2084
Saki「It's the flower I use in my perfume nowadays.」%K%P

0x2090
Saki「But in flower language, lilac means...」%K%P

0x209C
Saki「'The joy of youth' . It also means...」%K%P

0x20A8
Saki「'Memories of younger days'.」%K%P

0x20B4
Yuka「...Memories?」%K%P

0x20C8
Saki「It means what it says. To me, everything is nothing more%Nthan a memory.」%K%P

0x20D4
Saki「In other words, Makoto-kun and that boy are just%Nadditions to those memories...」%K%P

0x20E0
Saki「The only one I loved was that boy...」%K%P

0x20EC
...Her eyes... gaze off into the distance...%K%P

0x20F8
What is she looking at...?%K%P

0x2104
Saki「Besides... didn't I tell you?」%K%P

0x2110
Saki「Makoto-kun has it for someone else. He doesn't even%Nthink the slightest about me.」%K%P

0x2124
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2130
Someone else...%K Someone else...%K Who is that...?%K%P

0x213C
Saki「Ah... For your information, I still haven't aged past my%N'younger days' just yet.」%K%P

0x2148
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x215C
Yuka「Huh? Oh, yeah, I know...」%K%P

0x2178
Saki「What was with that 'pause' just now...?」%K%P

0x2184
She's thinking deeply, even though I didn't ask her%Nanything...%K%P

0x2198
Saki「In the first place, we're the same age.」%K%P

0x21AC
Yuka「Geez, I get it already...」%K%P

0x21C0
I say this, and immediately offer her the coffee cup in%Nfront of me.%K%P

0x21CC
Saki obediently accepts it, and brings the cup to her%Nmouth.%K%P

0x21D8
Saki「—!?」%K%P

0x21EC
Saki「What the hell is this? It's like ice coffee, only colder!」%K%P

0x21F8
Yuka「Oh... sorry. I'll go brew another one up...」%K%P

0x220C
Saki「It's fine, I'll do it.」%K%P

0x2220
She says that, takes the cup, and disappears into the%Nkitchen.%K%P

0x223C
...%K%P

0x2248
It kinda feels like I'm forcing myself to listen to her... At%Nleast, that's what I think.%K%P

0x2254
I'm much more aware than earlier, but it still doesn't feel%Nlike I can fully awaken yet...%K%P

0x228C
The cuckoo clock in the living room chirps twice.%K%P

0x2298
...It's 2:00 P.M.%K%P

0x22D0
Before long, Saki comes out of the kitchen, holding a%Ntray.%K%P

0x22DC
On the tray are two steaming hot cups, a sugar pot, and%Nmilk.%K%P

0x22E8
She silently places the cups on the table.%K%P

0x22F4
Instead of coffee, the cups contain black tea.%K%P

0x2300
Yuka「Th-Thank you...」%K%P

0x230C
Saki silently sits down.%K%P

0x2318
She puts sugar into her tea, and mixes it with a spoon.%K%P

0x2324
She spends a few seconds sniffing up the aroma of the%Ntea, then drinks it...%K%P

0x2330
...%K%P

0x2344
Saki「Ahh... that was calming.」%K%P

0x2350
...She's finally begun talking again.%K%P

0x235C
I let out a spontaneous sigh of relief.%K%P

0x2368
Saki「...Well then, now it's your turn.」%K%P

0x2384
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x2390
She says this so abruptly that I don't know what she's%Ntalking about.%K%P

0x239C
Saki「It's your turn to tell me your real feelings.」%K%P

0x23B0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x23BC
I gulp deeply.%K%P

0x23C8
Saki「Yuka, you're different than me, right?」%K%P

0x23D4
Saki「You're deeply in love with Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x23E0
Saki「...aren't you?」%K%P

0x23EC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x23F8
Saki stares intently at me, as if she can see through my%Nmind...%K%P

0x2424
Saki and I are the only ones in the room...%K The dining room%Nis as still as death...%K%P

0x2430
Saki's captivating eyes don't move an inch.%K%P

0x243C
I wonder if she plans to keep staring at me like that%Nforever until she gets an answer...%K%P

0x2448
"Well?"%K Her eyes are asking me that.%K%P

0x2454
Unable to stand the tension anymore, I slowly shake my%Nhead.%K%P

0x2484
Saki「You're lying...」%K%P

0x2490
Saki's eyes narrow.%K%P

0x249C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x24A8
Saki「You won't admit it?」%K%P

0x24B4
Yuka「...I-I don't know...」%K%P

0x24C0
I continue to shake my head...%K%P

0x24CC
Saki「You're just trying to deceive me again...!」%K%P

0x24D8
Saki「How long...?」%K%P

0x24E4
Saki「How long will this continue?」%K%P

0x24F0
—The air freezes over.%K%P

0x2504
Saki「You've always continued to deceive me!!!」%K%P

0x2728
Saki strikes the table with a "bang!"%K%P

0x2740
She leans her body forward, and glares at me.%K%P

0x274C
Saki「I... want to know your true feelings.」%K%P

0x2758
Saki「I'm sick of hearing all of these lies and crap coming from%Nyou.」%K%P

0x2764
Saki「Just earlier, I'd planned on telling you my true feelings%Nfrom the start.」%K%P

0x2770
Saki「So tell me what's on your mind.」%K%P

0x277C
Saki「I can't wait any longer for this. You've made me impatient%Nenough.」%K%P

0x27A0
Saki「Come on...!」%K%P

0x29CC
Yuka「—I WISH I COULD TELL YOU!!!」%K%P

0x29E4
Something within me bursts open and springs forth.%K%P

0x2A00
Saki「Yu—?」%K%P

0x2A24
Yuka「I want to know that... myself...!」%K%P

0x2A38
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2A4C
Yuka「Of course, I do...」%K%P

0x2A58
Yuka「...like Makoto...」%K%P

0x2A64
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x2A70
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2A84
Yuka「I... I don't know.」%K%P

0x2A90
Yuka「I still don't know...」%K%P

0x2A9C
Yuka「Whether these feelings are love or not.」%K%P

0x2AA8
Yuka「I don't know if they're something else...」%K%P

0x2AB4
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2AC0
Yuka「I can't tell the difference between 'like' and 'love' either...!」%K%P

0x2ACC
Everything that's pouring out of me is a scream from my%Nheart.%K%P

0x2AD8
Finally, I feel tears trickling down my face...%K%P

0x2AE4
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2AF0
Yuka「I have no confidence in my own feelings...」%K%P

0x2B04
Saki「Because you might just be chasing after a memory...?」%K%P

0x2B10
I silently nod.%K%P

0x2B34
...%K%P

0x2B48
Saki「Yuka...」%K%P

0x2B54
Saki「Do you know... why it is you can't tell the difference?」%K%P

0x2B60
I shake my head.%K%P

0x2B6C
Saki「I said it earlier, right? It's because you haven't changed%Na bit from when we were in middle school.」%K%P

0x2B78
Saki「You're not that much different from a child who's only%Njust started to love someone.」%K%P

0x2B84
Saki「People must meet others, fall in love, and get hurt...」%K%P

0x2B90
Saki「...That's how you grow up.」%K%P

0x2B9C
Saki「But you stopped growing up at that time...」%K%P

0x2BA8
Saki「Ever since 'that time'...」%K%P

0x2BD0
(That time... That time... )%K%P

0x2BDC
I start to feel a throbbing pain in my head.%K My body%Ntrembles violently.%K%P

0x2BE8
I instantly wrap my arms around myself as tight as I can,%Nembracing my body.%K%P

0x2BFC
Saki「It seems like you still haven't told Makoto-kun about it%Nyet...」%K%P

0x2C08
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2C14
Saki「About that boy who was in our class in 9th grade ...and%Nthe incident in June...」%K%P

0x2C20
Saki「That is, what happened at the hotel we stayed at at the%Nend of our field trip...」%K%P

0x2C58
I instinctively shut my eyes tightly.%K%P

0x2C64
Not wanting to hear the rest, I try to cover my ears.%K%P

0x2C70
—But Saki pins my hands down.%K%P

0x2CB0
Saki「Are you planning to ignore the truth by covering your%Nears and closing your eyes like that...?」%K%P

0x2CBC
I violently shake my head like a spoiled child throwing a%Ntantrum.%K%P

0x2CC8
Saki「You can't do that...」%K%P

0x2CD4
Saki「If you do, then you'll never get past the whole thing.」%K%P

0x2CE0
Saki「Because...」%K%P

0x2CEC
Saki「Because that boy is already...」%K%P

0x2D18
Saki「—Dead.」%K%P

0x2D24
Yuka「———!!」%K%P

0x2D30
My eyes open, and I freeze on the spot.%K%P

0x2D3C
Large tears come pouring down from my eyes.%K%P

0x2D48
It feels like my heart has been gouged out.%K%P

0x2D54
If possible, I had wanted to forget... that part of my past.%K%P

0x2D68
Saki「Yuka...」%K%P

0x2D74
Saki「Since that incident happened, your time has stopped.」%K%P

0x2D80
Saki「No... perhaps...」%K%P

0x2D8C
Saki「It might be more accurate to say... that you've been%Ncoming and going back to the same time.」%K%P

0x2D98
Saki「Because at this rate, you'll just repeat the same mistake%Nover and over again...」%K%P

0x2DA4
(Repeat the same... mistake...)%K%P

0x2DB0
(...Over and over again...)%K%P

0x2DBC
Saki「What the current you needs to do is not to forget, but to%Nmove on.」%K%P

0x2DC8
Saki「In order to do that, you need to face the source of your%Nobstacle.」%K%P

0x2DD4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2DE0
(I don't want to remember... I don't want to remember... I%NDON'T WANT TO REMEMBER... )%K%P

0x2DEC
(If I remember, then... my heart will completely break... )%K%P

0x2DF8
I shiver once again.%K%P

0x2E04
Saki then firmly grasps my hand.%K%P

0x2E10
As she grasps it...%K%P

0x2E24
Saki「...It's all right. Don't think that you're weak at all.」%K%P

0x2E30
...she says this with an admonishing tone.%K%P

0x2E44
Saki「So it's all right...」%K%P

0x2E50
Her voice is very gentle and full of tranquility...%K%P

0x2E5C
It's warm...%K%P

0x2E68
It feels like being held against a mother's chest...%K%P

0x2E7C
Saki「Can you remember?」%K%P

0x2E88
My tears and trembling haven't stopped.%K%P

0x2E94
However...%K%P

0x2EA0
I bite my lip, and give a faint nod...%K%P

0x2EF0
Yuka「It was the second day of our field trip in 9th grade...」%K%P

0x2EFC
Yuka「That night... at the hotel we were staying at...」%K%P

0x2F08
Yuka「...A fire broke out.」%K%P

0x2F14
I speak slowly as vague memories are awoken from within%Nme.%K%P

0x2F20
Yuka「I'm sure... it happened past 2:00 in the night...」%K%P

0x2F2C
Yuka「I was shaken awake by my friends who were staying in%Nthe same room as me.」%K%P

0x2F38
Yuka「When I woke up, the fire alarm was ringing...」%K%P

0x2F44
Yuka「I had barely gotten any sleep the night before, so I was%Nso deeply asleep that night that I couldn't hear the%Nsound of the bell...」%K%P

0x2F50
Yuka「We frantically tried to run outside by going down the%Nstairs... but the 3rd floor was already a sea of flames...」%K%P

0x2F5C
The vivid images of the disaster back then are%Nresurrected in my mind.%K%P

0x2F68
I shake even more violently.%K Saki grasps my hand even%Ntighter.%K%P

0x2F74
Yuka「...All we could do was to run back to our rooms...」%K%P

0x2F80
Yuka「Because... we were on the highest floor... we couldn't run%Nup...」%K%P

0x2F8C
Yuka「We frantically waved our hands from our rooms, begging%Nfor help...」%K%P

0x2F98
Yuka「...Even though we knew it was a futile effort...」%K%P

0x2FA4
Yuka「Everyone was suffering from the heat and smoke that%Npoured into our room from the lower floor...」%K%P

0x2FB0
Yuka「Gradually, it became painful for us to breathe, and our%Nconsciousnesses were turning dim.」%K%P

0x2FC4
Yuka「...At that time, something unbelievable happened.」%K%P

0x2FD0
Saki「That boy arrived?」%K%P

0x2FDC
I slowly nod.%K%P

0x2FE8
Yuka「I thought I was seeing an illusion....」%K%P

0x2FF4
Yuka「Because he was staying at the same annex you were in,%NSaki.」%K%P

0x3000
Yuka「But... it was really him, in the flesh.」%K%P

0x300C
Yuka「He ran over to us, carried up the weakest girl... and said%Nthis...」%K%P

0x3018
Yuka「'This room is still safe... I'll be back right away, so wait%Nhere.'」%K%P

0x3024
Yuka「When he finished saying that, he rushed out of the room,%Nstill holding the girl...」%K%P

0x3030
Saki「And just like that, he passed through the blaze, and%Nbrought each girl out in succession, helping them%Nescape...」%K%P

0x303C
Yuka「...Yes.」%K%P

0x3058
Saki「You were the last one he took out...」%K%P

0x3064
Saki「Why's that...?」%K%P

0x3070
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x307C
Yuka「Actually, he tried to save me second, after the first girl...」%K%P

0x3088
Yuka「But I told him this...」%K%P

0x3094
Yuka「'I'm still okay! Get the others out first!'」%K%P

0x30A0
Yuka「'This room is still safe, right? I'm this group's leader, so I'll%Ngo last!'」%K%P

0x30AC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x30C8
Yuka「Because I believed in his words... that 'it was still safe'...」%K%P

0x30D4
Yuka「So I trusted him, and let the other girls take priority...」%K%P

0x30E0
Yuka「It was strange, but... we both trusted each other.」%K%P

0x30EC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x30F8
Yuka「When the time came for my turn... I had already nearly lost%Nconsciousness...」%K%P

0x3104
Yuka「I remember... as he held me in his arms, I continued to call%Nhis name again and again...」%K%P

0x3110
"It's all right, it's all right..."%K%P

0x311C
"I'm... right here..."%K%P

0x3128
Yuka「Those were the only words he spoke...」%K%P

0x3134
Yuka「...Before I knew it, I had regained consciousness, and%Nwas outside...」%K%P

0x3140
Yuka「But... he... had used up all his strength...」%K%P

0x315C
Yuka「...And just like that, he breathed his last...」%K%P

0x3168
Saki「...」%K%P

0x3174
Yuka「There was almost no oxygen in the building, yet he kept%Ngoing in and out countless times.」%K%P

0x3180
Yuka「Thinking about it now, it was a miracle he managed to%Nsave all of us...」%K%P

0x318C
Yuka「He was so reckless... doing it even though he wasn't%Nobligated to do so...」%K%P

0x3198
(...Yes. Just like... Makoto...)%K%P

0x31A4
Saki「That's true...」%K%P

0x31B0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x31BC
Yuka「Just before he died, as he held me in his arms, he spoke%Nhis last words...」%K%P

0x31D0
...%K%P

0x31DC
...%K%P

0x31E8
Boy「Yuka... all this time... I've...」%K%P

0x31F4
Boy「...I've loved you...」%K%P

0x3200
...%K%P

0x320C
...%K%P

0x3278
...I don't know how much time has passed since then...%K%P

0x3284
Ever since I finished my whole story, I've continued to%Ncry on and on.%K%P

0x3290
My tears are like blood pouring out of my emotional%Nscars... Tears from the bottom of my heart.%K%P

0x329C
Once again, I clearly remember that day.%K%P

0x32A8
That unlucky accident...%K%P

0x32B4
His death...%K%P

0x32C0
His last words...%K%P

0x32CC
I wished to completely forget that, because the memory%Nwas just too bitter.%K%P

0x32D8
Even so, Saki held on to my hand tightly the whole time to%Nmake sure I don't lose sight of it...%K%P

0x32E4
Even after I've finished my story, she's still here.%K%P

0x32F0
When I finally calm down and regain my composure, Saki%Nstarts talking again.%K%P

0x3320
Saki「Ever since that fire, you've been scared to fall in love%Nagain, haven't you...?」%K%P

0x332C
Saki「You're definitely afraid of getting hurt again...」%K%P

0x3338
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3344
Saki「You created a shell to protect yourself.」%K%P

0x3350
Saki「As a result, even if you fall in love with someone, you'd%Nbe leaving your safety zone...」%K%P

0x335C
Saki「You've always been unable to take another step%Nforward.」%K%P

0x3368
(Another step forward...)%K%P

0x3374
Is that why I couldn't talk to Makoto about the fire...?%K%P

0x3380
I didn't want to burden him with that weight.%K%P

0x338C
As a result, I feel like Makoto and I are beginning to drift%Nfar apart...%K%P

0x3398
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x33AC
Saki「Try to remember...」%K%P

0x33B8
Saki「After that, did you ever fall in love again? With someone%Nas great as that boy?」%K%P

0x33C4
I shake my head slightly.%K%P

0x33D0
I don't understand.%K%P

0x33DC
At least not now.%K%P

0x33E8
Saki「I think you probably couldn't.」%K%P

0x33F4
Saki「After all, you had a reason, right?」%K%P

0x3400
Saki「If you fell in love with someone, you would have to reveal%Neverything about yourself.」%K%P

0x340C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3418
Saki「But it's all right now...」%K%P

0x3424
Saki「You've found someone you can love...」%K%P

0x3430
Saki「Even if it started because of the reason it did, that's all%Nright, isn't it?」%K%P

0x343C
Saki「That's definitely a half-step forward.」%K%P

0x3448
Saki「I think the rest depends on your feelings.」%K%P

0x3454
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3468
I look at Makoto's room.%K%P

0x3474
Is he still sleeping...?%K%P

0x3488
Yuka「The reason Makoto's like this...」%K%P

0x3494
Yuka「Is because... of me.」%K%P

0x34A0
Saki「...That's right.」%K%P

0x34AC
Yuka「I did something terrible... to Makoto.」%K%P

0x34B8
Yuka「That's why I think that at any rate, it's already too late%Nfor us.」%K%P

0x34C4
Yuka「It's already a lost cause...」%K%P

0x34D0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x34DC
Saki「Do you really... think that?」%K%P

0x34E8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3504
Saki「For god's sake... you're always so hesitant. It hurts to%Nlook at you.」%K%P

0x3518
Saki「Listen to me, Yuka.」%K%P

0x3524
Saki「Taking into account the conversation we had just now%Nand your strong feelings on the subject...」%K%P

0x3530
Saki「I don't think it's too late at all.」%K%P

0x353C
Saki「Before long, you're sure to have completely settled%Neverything...」%K%P

0x3548
Saki「No, you definitely will!」%K%P

0x3554
Yuka「...Wh-Why do you say that?」%K%P

0x3560
Saki「Hmm? Let's see...」%K%P

0x3574
Saki「Intuition, perhaps?」%K%P

0x3580
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3594
Saki「Come on, keep your chin up, Yuka Kawashima! Isn't your%Ngreatest redeeming feature your cheerfulness?」%K%P

0x35A0
Saki「This is all I'm going to say, so get back on your feet!」%K%P

0x35AC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x35C0
Saki「Haah... fine, then...」%K%P

0x35E4
Saki says this, and stands up.%K%P

0x35F0
And then...%K%P

0x3604
Saki「The Fourth Law of Professor Asakura's Love Formula!!」%K%P

0x3610
Yuka「—!?」%K%P

0x3664
Saki「The Third Law of Professor Asakura's Love%NFormula—Promises must definitely be kept.」%K%P

0x3670
Yuka「Then what should the Fourth Law be?」%K%P

0x367C
Saki「Good question...」%K%P

0x36BC
Saki「Professor Asakura's Fourth Law of Love—」%K%P

0x36C8
Saki「Men are courageous...」%K%P

0x36D4
Saki「Women are...?」%K%P

0x36E0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x36EC
Saki stares into space...%K%P

0x36F8
Before long...%K%P

0x370C
Yuka「Pfft ! ...Hee hee hee , ahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x3718
...I instinctively start laughing.%K%P

0x3724
Laughing?%K%P

0x3730
I actually want to cry...%K%P

0x373C
But I can't cry.%K%P

0x3748
Because, the Fourth Law is...%K%P

0x3754
The Fourth Law is...%K%P

0x3768
Saki「Come on. Go on, go on...」%K%P

0x377C
Yuka「Y-Yeah... right, right...」%K%P

0x3788
Yuka「Women are...」%K%P

0x37C0
Yuka「Then what should the Fourth Law be?」%K%P

0x37CC
Saki「Good question...」%K%P

0x37D8
??「What are you two thinking about?」%K%P

0x37E4
Yuka「Waah!! Hey! Were you listening!?」%K%P

0x37F0
??「I wasn't aware that listening was a crime.」%K%P

0x37FC
Saki「Geez! This is a private conversation—!!」%K%P

0x3808
??「My bad, my bad... More importantly, how about this?」%K%P

0x3814
Yuka「Hmm??」%K%P

0x3820
??「Men are courageous, women are charming.」%K%P

0x382C
Saki「...What's that?」%K%P

0x3848
Boy「—The Fourth Law of Professor Asakura's Love%NFormula.」%K%P

0x3888
Yuka「Women... are charming♪」%K%P

0x3894
I say that, and grin widely.%K%P

0x38A0
I wipe the tears rising to my eyes.%K%P

0x38AC
It's like seeing the sun appear in the sky after a%Nrainstorm... That's what it feels like.%K%P

0x38C0
Saki「Good, good♪」%K%P

0x38CC
In middle school, one day, when the two of us were%Nfooling around, we thought up the Love Formulas and%Ntheir laws.%K%P

0x38D8
The Fourth Law is profoundly memorable to me.%K%P

0x38E4
Specifically... because those were HIS words of%Nencouragement.%K%P

0x38F0
Another memory of him that I have...%K%P

0x3904
Saki「Well then, it would seem my role is over...」%K%P

0x3918
Saki「The rest is up to you ♪」%K%P

0x3924
She gives me a light tap on the head as she says this.%K%P

0x3938
Yuka「Um...」%K%P

0x394C
Yuka「Th-Thank you... Saki.」%K%P

0x3960
Saki「...It wasn't a big deal.」%K%P

0x396C
Saki「I was just doing it for my own sake, so it's fine...」%K%P

0x3980
(...?)%K%P

0x3994
Just like that, Saki turns around and walks to the front%Ndoor.%K%P

0x39A0
The gentle aroma of lilac that filled my nose slowly%Ndisappears...%K%P

0x3A04
—And, when she puts her hand on the doorknob...%K%P

0x3A10
Saki「Oh, right, almost forgot.」%K%P

0x3A1C
...She turns back around.%K%P

0x3A30
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x3A44
Saki「While I'm at it, I'll tell you something good♪」%K%P

0x3A50
Yuka「What's that?」%K%P

0x3A5C
Saki「The way to tell the difference between 'like' and 'love'.」%K%P

0x3A68
Saki「I myself have only felt it once, but I still know it.」%K%P

0x3A74
Yuka「So what is it...?」%K%P

0x3A80
Saki「Well, it's...」%K%P

0x3ACC
I sink deeply into the sofa as I blankly stare out the%Nwindow.%K%P

0x3AD8
In my head, Saki's last words repeat many times...%K%P

0x3AEC
Saki「The way to tell the difference between 'like' and 'love'...」%K%P

0x3AF8
Saki「It's whether or not you're able to think of yourself%Nsecond, and put the one you like ahead of you.」%K%P

0x3B04
Saki「After all, humans are very weak creatures...」%K%P

0x3B10
Saki「So being considerate of the one you like first and%Nforemost rather than yourself—that's 'love', wouldn't%Nyou say?」%K%P

0x3BC4
Just past 5:00, Haruka and Okuhiko-kun return.%K%N

0x3BD0
At 6:00, Haruka begins cooking.%K%N%N

0x3BDC
That's quite rare...%K%NI think she did this last time as well.%K%N

0x3BE8
Since she did it both times, is this her way of being%Nconsiderate and trying to help...?%K%P

0x3BFC
I didn't remember how it tasted last time... so I'm a little%Nsurprised at how delicious it is.%K%N

0x3C08
When I jokingly comment "You'll make a good wife%Nsomeday", Okuhiko-kun seems rather embarrassed for%Nsome reason.%K%N

0x3C14
(...???)%K%N

0x3C20
Haruka and I just tilt our heads in confusion...%K%N%N

0x3C2C
—Even though dinner has ended, Makoto is still in his%Nroom.%K%P

0x3CB0
The cuckoo clock chirps eight times.%K%P

0x3CBC
It's 8:00 P.M...%K%P

0x3CC8
—Makoto still hasn't come out of his room.%K%P

0x3CD4
Haruka calls out to him countless times, but there's no%Nresponse.%K%P

0x3CE0
He may have fallen asleep while thinking about%Nsomething...%K%P

0x3CEC
I'm worried, but as I am now, I don't have the courage to%Nknock on his door.%K%P

0x3CF8
I still don't know what sort of face I should greet him with...%K%P

0x3D10
"You've always been unable to take another step%Nforward."%K%P

0x3D1C
That's right. Eventually, I'll have to knock...%K%P

0x3D28
"I think the rest depends on your feelings."%K%P

0x3D34
I have to knock, or the door will never open...%K%P

0x3D9C
I slowly look at the clock while lying in bed.%K Soon, the%Ndate will change to the 6th.%K%P

0x3DA8
At this rate, tomorrow will end without any trouble...%K%P

0x3DB4
We've done everything possible in the last five days to%Neliminate the sources of those troubles.%K%P

0x3DC0
—Saki didn't get swallowed by the wave.%K —Haruka%Nand Saki never quarreled.%K —Kurumi-chan didn't go%Nmissing.%K%P

0x3DCC
—We never saw that talisman.%K —And all we have to%Ndo tomorrow is not go to the shrine...%K%P

0x3DD8
So at this rate, it'll be fine if I just sleep in until noon...%K%P

0x3DE4
With this, everything will end.%K%P

0x3DF0
Everything will end...%K%P

0x3E0C
It'll soon be the 7th—in other words, the last day of%Nthe camp.%K%P

0x3E18
When the time comes to go back, Makoto will have no%Nchoice but to see me.%K%P

0x3E24
...At that time, I plan to go out to Makoto and say this.%K%P

0x3E30
"Good morning..."%K%P

0x3E3C
I'll act very natural, like my usual self.%K%P

0x3E48
That's what my heart has decided...%K%P

0x3E54
... ... ...%K%P

0x3E98
Haruka「Yuka, are you awake...?」%K%P

0x3EA4
I hear a voice from behind the door.%K%P

0x3EB0
Yuka「...Haruka?」%K%P

0x3EBC
Yuka「It's open. Come on in...」%K%P

0x3EE4
Yuka「What's wrong...? It's rather late...」%K%P

0x3F14
Haruka「I forgot... to give you this...」%K%P

0x3F20
She says that, and stretches her hand out.%K She's%Ngrasping a small glass bottle in her hand.%K%P

0x3F2C
It's a purple bottle.%K%P

0x3F48
Yuka「What's that?」%K%P

0x3F54
Haruka「Today, when I was returning to the lodge... I met up with%NSaki...」%K%P

0x3F60
Haruka「She wanted me... to give this to you.」%K%P

0x3F6C
Yuka「O-Oh... thank you.」%K%P

0x3F80
I take the bottle.%K%P

0x3F8C
(...Perfume?)%K%P

0x3F98
I open it, and give it a sniff.%K A sweet aroma drifts in the air.%K%P

0x3FA4
The sweet aroma of lilac and fruit...%K%P

0x3FB0
It's the kind that Saki always uses...%K%P

0x3FC4
Yuka「But... why...?」%K%P

0x3FD0
I don't understand why she gave this to me.%K%P

0x3FDC
Haruka「She said... that she didn't need it anymore.」%K%P

0x3FF0
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x3FFC
Suddenly, I remember the flower language of lilacs that%NSaki told me about earlier.%K%P

0x4008
"The joy of youth."%K%P

0x4014
And... "Memories of younger days."%K%P

0x4020
Yuka「'Memories of younger days'...huh?」%K%P

0x402C
(Is she telling that she doesn't need to remember%Nanymore...?)%K%P

0x4038
Haruka「Huh?」%K%P

0x4044
Yuka「A-Ah... umm, it's what lilacs mean in flower language...」%K%P

0x4050
Yuka「'The joy of youth' . And also... 'memories of younger days'.」%K%P

0x4064
Haruka「That's flower language for white lilacs... right?」%K%P

0x4070
Yuka「Huh? ...White?」%K%P

0x407C
Haruka「Yes... The meaning of lilacs in flower language is different%Ndepending on its color. It's something that you see with%Na lot of different flowers.」%K%P

0x4088
White lilacs...%K A purple bottle...%K%P

0x4094
Haruka「For example, with roses...」%K%P

0x40A8
Yuka「Hey, Haruka. What do purple lilacs mean in flower%Nlanguage?」%K%P

0x40BC
Haruka「Huh!? R-Right... purple means...」%K%P

0x40E0
Haruka「Purple means... 'first love'.」%K%P

0x40EC
Haruka「And... 'the early emotions of love'.」%K%P

0x4100
(—!?)%K%P

0x410C
Yuka「The early emotions ...of love?」%K%P

0x4118
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x4124
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x4130
Haruka「Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x4144
Yuka「No... It's nothing...」%K%P

0x4150
Yuka「Thank you. I'll definitely accept this.」%K%P

0x415C
Haruka「...?」%K%P

0x4168
Haruka「Well then, good night...」%K%P

0x417C
Haruka leaves the room while tilting her head.%K%P

0x41D4
...%K%P

0x41E0
Saki「To me, everything is nothing more than a memory.」%K%P

0x41EC
—My eyelids tremble faintly.%K%P

0x41F8
—Did she really... remember?%K%P

0x4204
Saki「I love purple lilacs very much...」%K%P

0x4210
Saki「It's the flower I use in my perfume nowadays.」%K%P

0x421C
