... ... ...%K%P

0x15C
Today is pleasantly warm.%K%P

0x168
There's not a single cloud in the clear spring sky. A wind%Nblows in from the sea, bringing in the sweet fragrance of%Nflowers.%K%P

0x174
A white bird playfully glides across the ocean's surface.%K%N

0x180
A seagull... Or is it a black-tailed gull?%K%P

0x18C
Anyway, there's something that's bothering me.%K%N

0x198
Unlike yesterday, the waves are incredibly huge.%K%P

0x1A4
Even though the weather's good and the wind isn't that%Nstrong, the roar of the waves can be heard as they%Ncrash against the shore.%K%P

0x1B8
Haruka「The waves...」%K%P

0x1C4
Haruka mutters just two words.%K%P

0x1D0
Still, those words alone are enough for us to understand%Nwhat she means.%K%P

0x1DC
The smooth, bulky curl of the waves rises up and down,%Nas if it were the tongue of a sea monster.%K%P

0x254
The sign on Lunabeach's door says, "CLOSED".%K%P

0x260
Since Izumi-san had said yesterday that "the shop will%Nbe closed tomorrow," we'd been expecting this.%K%P

0x26C
It was all part of our plan.%K%P

0x278
That's because we all agreed last night to go to the%Npool together.%K%P

0x284
Yuka tries to open the front door.%K%P

0x290
Of course, it's locked.%K%P

0x2A4
Yuka「What should we do?」%K%P

0x2B0
Yuka turns to me for advice.%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「We should probably try the back-」%K%P

0x2D4
As I'm in the middle of answering...%K%P

0x328
Izumi「I'm sorry! I should have unlocked it!」%K%P

0x334
Izumi-san cheerfully apologizes.%K%P

0x340
Makoto「Oh, good morning.」%K%P

0x34C
Izumi「Good morning♪」%K%P

0x358
Yuka「Well then, are you all set, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x36C
Izumi「Well... about that...」%K%P

0x378
Izumi-san's eyebrows furrow sheepishly.%K%P

0x384
Izumi「The truth is, I might have to decline...」%K%P

0x390
Makoto「??」%K%P

0x3A4
Izumi「Well, why don't we continue this conversation inside?」%K%P

0x3B0
Izumi「Please, come on in!」%K%P

0x424
Izumi「Have you had breakfast?」%K%P

0x438
Okuhiko「No, we didn't get around to it yet.」%K%P

0x444
Izumi「Well then, how about I whip something simple up for you%Nall?」%K%P

0x460
Yuka「It's fine, you already treated us to dinner yesterday...」%K%P

0x46C
Yuka「Besides, shouldn't the pool have a stand?」%K%P

0x478
Okuhiko slouches in disappointment at these words.%K%N

0x484
Well, it's not like I can't sympathize with him.%K%P

0x490
I was also hoping for Izumi-san to make us breakfast.%K%P

0x49C
Yuka「More importantly, let's continue the conversation from%Nearlier...」%K%P

0x4A8
Yuka「You look rather worried about something...」%K%P

0x4BC
Izumi「Y-Yes... That's... right...」%K%P

0x4C8
Izumi mumbles this.%K%N

0x4D4
Then, over there...%K%P

0x528
Kurumi「Morning...」%K%P

0x534
Kurumi comes onto the terrace, sounding like she's%Nforcing herself to recite these words.%K%P

0x540
She looks as depressed as a rainy afternoon.%K%P

0x554
Yuka「Is something wrong, Kurumi-chan?」%K%P

0x560
Kurumi「Yeah... Kurumi's... got a little headache...」%K%P

0x56C
Makoto「Are you okay?」%K%P

0x578
Kurumi「Mmm...」%K%P

0x584
Kurumi「Probably not.」%K%P

0x5A0
Saki「You shouldn't go to the pool in this state.」%K%P

0x5AC
Kurumi「Right... Sorry about this.」%K%P

0x5B8
Saki「You don't really need to apologize...」%K%P

0x5C4
Saki「Anyway, why don't you take a little rest for today?」%K%P

0x5D0
Saki kindly says this.%K%P

0x5DC
Kurumi gives a small nod while staring at the table.%K%P

0x5F8
Izumi「So that's how it is...」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x610
Izumi「I'm sorry for disappointing you, but would you five be all%Nright going alone?」%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「'You five going alone'... Then you're not coming with us,%NIzumi-san?」%K%P

0x628
Izumi「Right. I have to take care of her.」%K%P

0x634
Izumi-san says this as she pats Kurumi's head.%K%P

0x648
Kurumi「It'll be fine! Kurumi will be fine by herself!」%K%P

0x654
Kurumi「Go with them, Onee-chan.」%K%P

0x668
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0x674
Izumi-san looks troubled.%K%P

0x680
I want to say something, but I don't feel like I have the%Nright to butt in, so I keep my mouth shut.%K%P

0x68C
There is a brief moment of silence as the sisters stare%Nat each other.%K%P

0x698
Izumi「Are you really all right?」%K%P

0x6AC
Kurumi「Kurumi's fine!!」%K%P

0x6B8
Kurumi says this very firmly, as if she's forgotten that%Nshe's in pain.%K%P

0x6C4
Well, if she says so... As for Izumi-san...%K%P

0x6D8
Izumi「All right. Well then, I guess I'll go, too.」%K%P

0x6E4
... Her face breaks out into a kind smile.%K%P

0x6F8
Izumi「But you have to rest, all right!?」%K%P

0x704
Of course, Izumi-san gives Kurumi one last warning%Nbefore she leaves.%K%P

0x780
The fastest way to get to the Tsukiya Hotel is by%Ncrossing Moon Beach.%K%P

0x78C
Like nomads in a desert, we walk alongside the coast in%Na straight line.%K%P

0x798
Okuhiko walks at the head of the line, frolicking like a kid%Nfor some reason.%K%P

0x7A4
Tailing him from behind is the ever cheerful Yuka, who's%Njust as excited as Okuhiko.%K%P

0x7B0
Behind her are Saki and Izumi-san, who are having a%Npleasant conversation about something.%K%P

0x7BC
The girls are a little far ahead of me...%K%P

0x7C8
At the back of the line is Haruka, who is trudging along%Nslowly with heavy steps.%K%P

0x7FC
(Haruka... what's wrong?)%K%P

0x808
I think this as I take a glance at her over my shoulder.%K%P

0x814
Even though Haruka isn't exactly the cheerful type, she%Nlooks seriously depressed right now.%K%P

0x830
(Could it be that she didn't want to go to the pool after%Nall?)%K%P

0x83C
I casually slow down and wait for Haruka to catch up.%K%P

0x848
And then...

0x854
... Something a little unexpected happens.%K%P

0x860
When Haruka passes by me, she grabs my wrist.%K%P

0x86C
No, not out of a romantic gesture...%K%P

0x878
She did so urgently, like she had something to say.%K%P

0x884
Shocked, I turn to face Haruka.%K%P

0x898
Makoto「What's...」%K%P

0x8A4
I'm trying to ask, "What's wrong?", but for some reason, I%Ncan't continue.%K%N

0x8B0
Is it because of her strikingly lonely eyes?%K%P

0x8BC
They shine like a star that's beginning to fade in the%Nmorning glow.%K%P

0x8C8
Haruka「... Kurumi.」%K%P

0x8D4
She quietly says this.%K%P

0x8E0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x8EC
Though I heard her just fine, I instinctively ask her to%Nrepeat herself.%K%P

0x8F8
Haruka「I wonder... if Kurumi's okay?」%K%P

0x904
She mutters this sorrowfully as her grip around my wrist%Ntightens.%K%P

0x910
She's that worried about Kurumi...?%N%W%W

0x91C
Since she said she had a headache...?%K

0xCF0
Reassure Haruka.

0xCFC
Honestly, I'm worried about Kurumi too.

0x95C
Makoto「Don't worry, she'll be fine!」%K%P

0x968
I say this as cheerfully as I can.%K%P

0x974
Makoto「After all, when she was arguing with Izumi-san, she%Nseemed quite energetic, didn't she?」%K%P

0x980
Haruka「You think so...?」%K%P

0x98C
Makoto「Of course.」%K%P

0x998
Makoto「A headache isn't anything particularly serious to worry%Nabout...」%K%P

0x9A4
Makoto「Besides, you've had headaches before, haven't you?」%K%P

0x9B0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x9BC
Makoto「Like, for example, due to being 'forced to spend a whole%Nweek with good-for-nothing shady strangers', perhaps?」%K%P

0x9D0
Upon hearing that, Haruka gives a slight grin.%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「And one of those guys, with that mullet-like hairdo, looks%Nlike some sort of reject punk rocker...」%K%P

0x9E8
As I continue to add my joke, Haruka finally giggles.%K%P

0x9F4
The sight of her laughing encourages me, and I try to%Ncome up with an even wittier punch line...%K%P

0xA00
Makoto「No, rather than a reject punk rocker, it's more like-」%K%P

0xA0C
Haruka「A mop.」%K%P

0xA18
Haruka suddenly speaks.%K%P

0xA24
Makoto「Huh...? You mean like the mop you wipe the floor with?」%K%P

0xA30
Haruka「Right.」%K%P

0xA3C
So Okuhiko's hairdo resembles a mop?%K%P

0xA48
Hmm, I see... That might be the best way to describe it.%K%P

0xA54
Makoto「I see. So anyway, you don't have to worry at all!」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「You wouldn't want Kurumi to look at that drenched, shiny,%Nfilthy mop and get sick, would you?」%K%P

0xA6C
Makoto「Just thinking about it is giving me a headache... So%Nimagine what it'd be like seeing it in real life.」%K%P

0xA78
Haruka, who up until now has been quite reserved, gives%Na completely natural smile.%K%P

0xA84
Makoto「So you don't need to worry!」%K%P

0xA90
Despite this being completely nonsense...%K%P

0xA9C
Haruka「Yes, I understand.」%K%P

0xAA8
... Haruka mutters this, and quietly lets go of my wrist.%K%P

0xABC
And so, I begin to walk towards the pool again.%K%P

0xAC8
Haruka is now several paces behind me.%K%P

0xAD4
(Nevertheless...)%K%P

0xAE0
As I walk, I reflect on what just happened.%K%P

0xAEC
(Nevertheless, to get this worried over a something as%Nsimple as a headache...)%K%P

0xAF8
(Haruka seems cold at first glance, but maybe deep%Ndown, she's a kind, compassionate girl...)%K%P
