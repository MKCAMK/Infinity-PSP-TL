I head to Lunabeach after waking up.%K%P

0x140
When I think about the "last" 4th, I realize that I probably%Nshould be going to see the crab sumo with Kurumi like%N"last time", but something like that no longer matters to%Nme.%K%P

0x14C
Fortunately, Okuhiko left early this morning to go fishing%Nwith Haruka.%K%P

0x158
I don't have to worry about him getting in my way.%K%P

0x164
Strangely, the thought of Okuhiko accompanying Haruka%Ndoesn't make me angry.%K%P

0x170
Okuhiko is serious about Haruka.%K Despite being rejected%Nand ridiculed many times, he never gives up.%K%P

0x17C
Granted, he's too oblivious to tell that he's being%Nrejected, and he doesn't know when to quit, so I guess%Nyou could just call him an idiot...%K%P

0x188
Still, I understand what it means to be serious about%Nsomeone.%K%P

0x194
After all... I'm even more serious about Izumi-san.%K%P

0x1A0
I don't care how I look anymore.%K%P

0x1AC
After all... I'm just as bad at not knowing when to give up...%K%P

0x1E4
Including today, my time limit is two days!%K%P

0x1F0
... No more, no less!!%K%P

0x1FC
I run as fast as I can, aiming for Lunabeach.%K%P

0x260
Izumi「Oh? Welcome♪」%K%P

0x26C
Even though I came in here out of breath, Izumi-san still%Ngives me a smile.%K%P

0x278
I'm relieved.%K%P

0x284
After all, if she wasn't here, I'd...%K%P

0x290
Makoto「I'm glad... that you're here.」%K%P

0x29C
Izumi「???」%K%P

0x2A8
It's from a book I read.%K%P

0x2B4
There was this guy, who, when the time came to confess%Nhis feelings, didn't need many words.%K%P

0x2C0
All he needed were eight words.%K%P

0x2CC
These words were:%K%P

0x2D8
"I'm... right here."%K%N

0x2E4
"I'm glad... that you're here."%K%P

0x2F0
Izumi「Hee hee... what's wrong? You're up early...」%K%P

0x2FC
Izumi-san turns aside my cryptic words with a smile.%K%P

0x308
The problem isn't whether or not I can get my words%Nthrough to her.%K%P

0x314
The main problem is that I need to work up my courage to%Nsay it...%K%P

0x320
Makoto「No... I didn't know if today would also be busy...」%K%P

0x32C
I remember how busy the shop was on April 5th.%K%P

0x338
Izumi「Thank you for worrying. But I'm all right. See, business is%Nin a slump as always...」%K%P

0x344
Izumi「Besides, you've probably forgotten in all of this%Nexcitement, but today's actually Tuesday.」%K%P

0x350
Makoto「... Ah!」%K%P

0x35C
That's right...%K%P

0x368
Because we've been so busy deceiving Okuhiko, I've%Ncompletely forgotten that today is Tuesday, April 9th...%K%P

0x374
In other words, Lunabeach is closed for today.%K%P

0x380
Izumi「Okuhiko-kun might come, so I've kept the shop open%Ntemporarily... Well, it seems like there's nothing to worry%Nabout for now, right?」%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「Yeah... Okuhiko will probably be fishing with Haruka until%Nnoon.」%K%P

0x398
Izumi「Oh, really? Then perhaps he'll come here at noon.」%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「... Probably.」%K%P

0x3B0
Izumi「Then I can't close the shop. And just when I was thinking%Nof taking a walk somewhere...」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x3C8
I don't overlook those words.%K%P

0x3D4
A walk...%K%P

0x3E0
If she were to close the shop now, then I could walk with%NIzumi-san...%K%P

0x3EC
Izumi「I poured some black tea... Would you like some?」%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「Um, actually-」%K%P

0x404
Izumi「Or would you prefer coffee?」%K%P

0x410
Makoto「That's not-」%K%P

0x41C
Izumi「I'm very sorry... but I'm out of Japanese tea.」%K%P

0x428
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x434
Izumi「Hee hee♪ ... Just kidding. So, what do you want?」%K%P

0x440
Izumi-san gives a mischievous smile.%K%N

0x44C
It seems she knew from the beginning.%K%P

0x458
I just can't beat her, can I?%K%P

0x464
Makoto「Can we... take a little walk?」%K%P

0x470
Izumi「Huh? But...」%K%P

0x47C
Makoto「It's all right. We'll get back before Okuhiko and Haruka get%Nhere...」%K%P

0x488
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「Let's go.」%K%P

0x4A0
Izumi「... Sure♪」%K%P

0x500
First, we head to the harbor.%K%P

0x50C
Did Okuhiko and Haruka really go fishing or not? ... We%Ncame here to confirm that.%K%P

0x560
When we arrive at the pier, we see Haruka sitting alone%Nwith her fishing rod in the water.%K%P

0x56C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x578
Izumi「Haruka-chan... seems to be all alone.」%K%P

0x584
We walk over to Haruka's side.%K%P

0x598
Haruka turns around when she notices us.%K%P

0x5A4
... At that moment, something tugs against her fishing rod.%K%P

0x5B8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x5C4
Haruka expressionlessly pulls back on the rod, and%Nreels it in. She then masterfully pulls in a horse mackerel.%K%P

0x5D0
For a little while, Haruka holds the flopping horse%Nmackerel in her hands, looks at it, and then silently%Nreleases it back into the ocean.%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「Haruka... where's Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x5E8
Izumi「I heard you were together.」%K%P

0x5F4
Haruka shakes her head.%K%P

0x600
Makoto「But Yuka said you left together...」%K%P

0x60C
Haruka「If you're looking for Okuhiko, he went out on a walk%Nsomewhere.」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「A walk...」%K%P

0x62C
Haruka「Because Okuhiko caught absolutely nothing...」%K%P

0x638
That's probably not the only reason.%K%P

0x644
I bet that he got tired of trying to strike up a%Nconversation with Haruka, who showed no signs of%Nresponding, so he left for a change of mood.%K%P

0x650
Okuhiko is surprisingly impatient...%K%P

0x65C
Now that I think about it, he's from a prestigious family,%Nisn't he?%K%P

0x668
I'd forgotten that Okuhiko was the son of the Iida%NFinancial Group.%K%P

0x674
His speech and conduct over the past few days%Nhaven't reflected any of that at all.%K%P

0x680
Is this really what the sons of the newly wealthy are%Nlike...?%K%P

0x68C
Makoto「Well then, Haruka, we'll be going now.」%K%P

0x698
Izumi「We'll return to the shop at noon.」%K%P

0x6A4
Haruka silently nods.%K%P

0x6B8
We leave just as Haruka gets another bite on her fishing%Nrod.%K%P

0x734
When we reach the shopping district, Izumi-san suddenly%Nhesitates.%K%P

0x748
Izumi「Ah... mind if we stop here a bit?」%K%P

0x754
Makoto「Huh? Why?」%K%P

0x768
Izumi「Well... the truth is, I'm out of ingredients for the barbecue.」%K%P

0x774
Oh... the barbecue.%K%P

0x780
Now that I think about it, today is the day of the%Nbarbecue...%K%P

0x794
Izumi-san and I go around the shopping district, and buy%Nmeat and vegetables.%K%P
