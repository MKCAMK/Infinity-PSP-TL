Before long, we arrive at Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0x80
Izumi-san is standing by the safety rail, gazing out at%Nthe ocean.%K%P

0x8C
The light sea breeze blows by Izumi-san, swaying%Nthrough her hair.%K%P

0x98
All I can hear around me is the calming roar of the waves,%Nwhich occasionally wash up against the bottom of the%Ncape.%K%P

0xA4
Izumi-san hasn't said a single word since we arrived at%Nthe park...%K%P

0xBC
(I don't get it... What is Izumi-san hoping to do by taking%Nme all the way to a place like this?)%K%P

0xC8
(I wonder if it would it be best after all if I just asked her%Ndirectly...?)%K%P

0xD4
I slowly approach Izumi-san.%K%P

0xF8
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x104
Makoto「Y-Yes...!?」%K%P

0x110
Izumi-san opens her mouth just as I stand right behind%Nher.%K%P

0x11C
Izumi「Even though we went through all this trouble to run here,%Nthe wind has just gone back from chilly to cold again,%Nhasn't it?」%K%P

0x128
Makoto「Y... You're right.」%K%P

0x134
It's true. All that sweat that I let off as I ran has become%Ncompletely chilled.%K%P

0x140
Izumi「But... as I thought...」%K%P

0x14C
(As I thought... what?)%K%P

0x158
Izumi「As I thought... today is...」%K%P

0x164
(Today is what?)%K%P

0x170
Izumi「It's a little cold, but as I thought, today...」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x190
Izumi「Today is the day the stars are at their most beautiful.」%K%P

0x19C
She lets out a sigh of awe.%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「Huh? The stars?」%K%P

0x1C4
Izumi「It's a good thing we came here, right?」%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「... Ah!」%K%P

0x224
A canopy of stars hangs above me.%K%P

0x230
The stars sparkle like shining gems on jet black velvet.%K%P

0x23C
No... not just gems... diamonds of the highest karat%Npossible... I've never seen anything so radiant in my%Nentire life.%K%P

0x248
This starry sky is truly captivating.%K%P

0x254
It feels like it's pulling my soul up towards the heavens...%Nlike it's drawing me up to the sky... That's how amazing it is.%K%P

0x260
Izumi「Thank you... for today.」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x278
Izumi「For Kurumi.」%K%P

0x284
Makoto「R-Right...」%K%P

0x290
Izumi-san slowly turns around.%K%P

0x2A4
Izumi「If you and the others hadn't been here... I might not have%Nfound her by now.」%K%P

0x2B0
Makoto「No way... you're over exaggerating.」%K%P

0x2BC
I feel a bit embarrassed to receive such praise.%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「Even if we didn't look, don't you think she would have%Ncome back safe anyway?」%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「Kurumi is surprisingly level-headed, after all...」%K%P

0x2E0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x2EC
Izumi-san hangs her head downwards.%K%P

0x2F8
What's wrong?%K Did I say something I shouldn't have?%K%P

0x304
Izumi「... Um, Makoto-kun...?」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「Yes...?」%K%P

0x31C
Izumi「Kurumi has quite the vagrant habits...」%K%P

0x328
Izumi「Occasionally, she'll suddenly go out, only to come back%Na little while later.」%K%P

0x334
Izumi「That's why... I was worried this time...」%K%P

0x340
Makoto「But she'd still come back on her own, right? I mean, she's%Ndone so up until now, hasn't she?」%K%P

0x34C
Izumi「Up until now... yes. But... But you know?」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x364
Izumi「... No... it's nothing... Don't worry about it.」%K%P

0x370
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x37C
I can't bring myself to ask her what she means.%K%P

0x388
I feel that if I did, I'd be denying her smile.%K%P

0x394
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x3A0
Izumi-san asks me this in a barely audible whisper.%K%P

0x3AC
She stares at me, her eyes glimmering from the starlight.%K%P

0x3B8
Izumi「Do you know why... I brought you here?」%K

0x948
I do.

0x954
I don't.

0x3F8
Makoto「Yes...」%K%P

0x404
I answer her.%K%P

0x410
Makoto「Because you wanted to show me the stars, right?」%K%P

0x41C
Makoto「You knew that Viewpoint Park had the best view of the%Nstars, so you wanted to show it to me as well...」%K%P

0x428
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x434
Izumi「... You're half right, and half wrong.」%K%P

0x440
Izumi-san says this as a smile rises to her face.%K%P

0x44C
Despite her smile, she seems troubled.%K%P

0x458
Makoto「Then... what's the other half?」%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「No...」%K%P

0x478
I answer honestly.%K%P

0x484
Izumi「... Do you want to know?」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「Yes...」%K%P

0x49C
Izumi「Really?」%K%P

0x4A8
Izumi-san coyly looks up at me.%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「Y-Yes...」%K%P

0x4C0
Izumi「Then I'll tell you.」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4D8
Izumi「Umm...」%K%P

0x4E4
Izumi「There's something I have to tell you...」%K%P

0x4F0
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x4FC
Izumi「But I want you... to know something in advance, no matter%Nwhat...」%K%P

0x508
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x514
Izumi「I... for all this time...」%K%P

0x520
Izumi「Ever since we first met, I...」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x538
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x544
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x550
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x55C
She's searching for the right words.%K%P

0x568
She remains still and hushed as she mulls over them.%K%P

0x574
I just silently wait.%K%P

0x580
For some reason, my chest feels hot.%K%P

0x58C
Izumi「... For... For example... It's like this.」%K%P

0x598
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x5A4
Izumi「It's like the starry sky we can see from here...」%K%P

0x5B0
Izumi「... The light shining from them now isn't the light they're%Nemitting at this very instant, correct?」%K%P

0x5BC
Izumi-san casts her attention to the vast ocean of%Nstars above us.%K%P

0x5D0
Izumi「For example, the light from Procyon, a part of Canis Minor,%Ncame from 11 years ago...」%K%P

0x5DC
Izumi「And the light from Regulus, a part of Leo, came from 84%Nyears ago...」%K%P

0x5E8
Izumi「Which means...」%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi「... Perhaps that light might disappear at this very moment.」%K%P

0x600
Izumi「No one knows whether or not that star exists right now,%Nat this very instant...」%K%P

0x60C
Izumi「Nobody can declare that everything they see is the%Ntruth...」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x624
Izumi「Aren't people's minds also the same way?」%K%P

0x630
Makoto「... Their minds?」%K%P

0x63C
Izumi-san nods in response as she looks towards me.%K%P

0x650
Izumi「Nobody knows if what I'm thinking is the truth or not.」%K%P

0x65C
Izumi「No one knows if what I'm feeling is correct or not... Yes...%Neven I myself don't know.」%K%P

0x668
Izumi「... But... But you know what?」%K%P

0x674
Izumi「I think that's all right.」%K%P

0x680
Izumi「'Right now, Regulus is still continuing to shine as always'...%N... I think it's happier... if you believe that.」%K%P

0x68C
Izumi「The truth is, what's more important than whether it's true%Nor not is whether you can believe it or not, isn't it? ...%NThat's how I feel.」%K%P

0x6B4
The sea breeze rustles by us.%K%P

0x6C0
In the darkness, we hear the sound of the waves%Nbreaking against the bottom of the cape far below us.%K%P

0x6CC
Izumi-san's lips tremble slightly.%K%P

0x6D8
I see her eyes waver, the stars reflecting off them.%K%P

0x6F0
Izumi「So Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x6FC
Izumi「Please... don't say anything...」%K%P

0x708
Izumi「I just wanted... to tell you this...」%K%P

0x714
Izumi「I just wanted you to know that in advance...」%K%P

0x730
Her eyes are locked with mine.%K%P

0x73C
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x748
Izumi「I...」%K%P

0x764
Izumi「I...」%K%P

0x770
Izumi-san takes a slow breath.%K%P

0x77C
And then...%K%P

0x788
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x794
Izumi「I love you...」%K%P

0x7BC
My heart thumps loudly.%K%P

0x7E0
My throat is becomes parched, and my body gets hot.%K%P

0x7EC
I do everything I can to conceal my trembling...%K%P

0x7F8
... I... I have to say something. That's my first thought.%K%P

0x804
Makoto「Izumi-san... I-」%K%P

0x820
Izumi「Hey!」%K%P

0x82C
Izumi「I said 'Don't say anything', didn't I?」%K%P

0x838
Izumi-san places her index finger over my open mouth.%K%P

0x844
Izumi「Even now, Regulus is continuing to shine...」%K%P

0x850
Izumi「... That alone is enough for me.」%K%P

0x85C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x868
I silently stand stock still.%K%P

0x874
Izumi-san takes her finger off my lips, but I still can't say%Na word.%K%P

0x880
(Is this what it feels like... to be loved... by another%Nperson?)%K%P

0x88C
No, that might not be it.%K%P

0x898
I'm not being loved by a "person"...%K%N

0x8A4
—I might be being loved... by a "goddess".%K%P
