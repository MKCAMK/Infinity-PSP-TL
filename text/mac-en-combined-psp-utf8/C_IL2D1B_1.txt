The now burning red sun is setting far off to the west.%K%P

0x130
It slowly, but steadily, begins to sink down towards the%Nhorizon.%K%P

0x13C
This whole afternoon, I've been keenly aware of the%Nnormally ignored swiftness of time.%K%P

0x148
Makoto「Why... did this...」%K%P

0x154
Makoto「What should I do... from now on...?」%K%P

0x160
In contrast to the quickly passing hours, I've stayed put%Nthe entire time, unable to do anything.%K%P

0x16C
A day progresses when the morning comes, when it%Nbecomes afternoon, and finally when night comes, as it%Nhas now.%K%P

0x178
A day that's passed away can never be relived, and%Ntime that's been washed away can never be recovered.%K%P

0x184
That's what I'd thought...%K%N

0x190
I undoubtedly believed that...%K%P

0x19C
But...%K%P

0x1A8
In this ridiculous world where common sense has%Ncompletely crumbled, I've completely lost sight of the%Ntruth.%K%P

0x1B4
Izumi「Nobody can declare that everything they see is the%Ntruth...」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi-san once said that right here in this park while%Nlooking out across the starry sky.%K%P

0x1CC
What's real... and what's false...?%K%P

0x1D8
As I'm unable to even tell the distinction between reality%Nand fiction, it's no wonder that I'm at a loss.%K%P

0x1E4
Before my eyes is the cold, iron fence...%K%P

0x1F0
It encircles the wide cape, standing completely upright.%K%P

0x1FC
Upright... upright...%K%P

0x208
The pipes that I had kicked countless times until they%Nbent horribly are completely undamaged.%K%P

0x214
The fence isn't broken at all...%K%P

0x264
I walk towards Lunabeach, tottering down the road lined%Nwith cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0x270
(I need to get the truth from Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x27C
Right now, it's clear that only Izumi-san can understand%Nmy mental state.%K%P

0x288
Likewise, I'm the only one who's able to understand hers.%K%P

0x294
What is Izumi-san feeling right now? —The answer to%Nthat is clear to me.%K%P

0x2A0
Obviously, it's because the only ones that experienced%Nthis incomprehensible phenomenon are Izumi-san and I...%K%P

0x2AC
Because Izumi-san "time traveled", just like me...%K%P

0x304
Yuka「M-Makoto! Geez, where did you go!?」%K%P

0x310
When I step out onto the coastline road, Yuka calls out%Nto me.%K%P

0x31C
Yuka「Don't just leave without a word...」%K%P

0x328
Yuka「We were worried, you know?」%K%P

0x33C
Haruka and Okuhiko appear from behind Yuka.%K%P

0x350
Okuhiko「Seriously... You're not a very cooperative person, are%Nyou?」%K%P

0x35C
Okuhiko「You do know what the goal of this Seminar Camp is, don't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x368
Okuhiko「This strange situation is exactly what you're supposed%Nto keep in mind and avoid.」%K%P

0x374
... The "goal"... "To form bonds with each other"...%K%P

0x390
Haruka「That's enough... of that...」%K%P

0x39C
Haruka「Let's go...」%K%P

0x3B8
Haruka says this, and starts briskly walking away.%K%P

0x3D4
Yuka「You're going with us too, Makoto.」%K%P

0x3E0
Makoto「'Going'... Where are we going?」%K%P

0x3F4
Yuka「The shopping district.」%K%P

0x400
Yuka「Even if we go back to the lodge, there's nothing to do%Nthere.」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「The shopping district...?」%K%P

0x418
(Oh... right...)%K%P

0x424
On the last April 1st, we were trying to head to the%Nshopping district, and came across Lunabeach on the%Nway.%K%P

0x430
If I am to repeat history, then I'll have to go there this%Ntime as well...%K%P

0x444
Yuka「Come on, let's go♪」%K%P

0x458
With that, Yuka grabs my hand and starts walking.%K%P

0x464
For now, I decide to just keep quiet and go with them.%K%P

0x470
Either way, I was planning on going to Lunabeach...%K%P

0x47C
(... Huh? ... Hold on.)%K%P

0x488
Something's bugging me.%K%P

0x494
Last time, Okuhiko said that the goal of the Seminar Camp%Nwas "to deceive me."%K%P

0x4A0
And it wasn't just him deceiving me, but also Izumi-san,%Neven though she's not a member of the Seminar Camp.%K%P

0x4AC
(Just what does this mean...?)%K%P

0x540
While I'm thinking this, we arrive at Moon Beach in the blink%Nof an eye.%K%P

0x54C
Yuka lets go of my hand, and ascends the bank in front%Nof her.%K%P

0x564
Yuka「Wow〜♪ Look, the scenery's amazing...」%K%P

0x570
Lured in by her voice, Haruka and Okuhiko also climb up%Nthe bank.%K%P

0x57C
Okuhiko「You're right... it really is magnificent...」%K%P

0x588
Okuhiko「No, it's the best...」%K%P

0x594
Yuka「Well? Didn't I tell you that this was a good idea?」%K%P

0x5B0
Yuka says this proudly, and one second later, she%Ndisappears from my field of vision.%K%P

0x5BC
She's at the other side of the bank... She probably%Njumped down onto the sandy beach.%K%P

0x5C8
Okuhiko goes next, and last, it's Haruka's turn...%K%P

0x600
When I hear that sound, my body moves by reflex.%K%P

0x618
I run up the bank, and jump down onto Moon Beach.%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x67C
She looks confused...%K%P

0x688
This is a familiar scene...%K%P

0x694
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x6A0
When I come to my senses, I walk over to her side, grab%Nher hand, and help her up.%K%P

0x6AC
Haruka gives a short nod.%K%P

0x6B8
She's clearly trying to hide her embarrassment.%K%P

0x6C4
(What's the meaning of this...?)%K%P

0x6D0
(This is... the third time, right?)%K%P

0x6DC
I firmly stare into the trembling Haruka's eyes.%K%P

0x6E8
Haruka quickly and nervously avoids my eyes, gets to%Nher feet, and moves past me.%K%P

0x718
With the setting sun shining on her back, Haruka%Ngradually walks farther and farther away.%K%P

0x724
I try to find an answer as I see her off.%K%P

0x758
(... The third time...)%K%P

0x764
(... April 1st...)%K%P

0x770
(... Time travel...)%K%P

0x78C
Makoto「I've got it!」%K%P

0x798
I unintentionally shout.%K%P

0x7A4
A part of my fragmented thoughts have clicked together%Nlike pieces of a puzzle.%K%P

0x7B0
In other words, it's like this.%K%P

0x7BC
I witnessed Haruka fall in the last April 1st.%K%P

0x7C8
And before Haruka actually fell, I definitely saw that%Nevent happen.%K%P

0x7D4
Up until now, I just thought that was a premonition, but it%Nseems that I was wrong.%K%P

0x7E0
—Time travel.%K%P

0x7EC
If I had time traveled once more before those past six%Ndays, then it wouldn't be odd for me to know in advance%Nabout Haruka falling.%K%P

0x7F8
In short, it was merely a memory of an event from those%Npast six days...%K%P

0x804
Which means... isn't it like this?%K%P

0x810
There's today's April 1st, then there was the last April 1st,%Nand an April 1st before that one, so if I continue with that%Npattern...%K%P

0x81C
—Is this an infinite loop?%K%P

0x828
I may have been experiencing these past six days%Ncountless times, with no end in sight.%K%P

0x834
When I think of it that way, I can explain all of my%Npremonitions.%K%P

0x840
The rice at Lunabeach, the earthquake at the pool, the%Ncar's battery, what we were having for dinner that night,%Nand the cards.%K%P

0x84C
They were all events that I'd experienced before.%K%P

0x858
Which means that those were not premonitions, but just%Nmemories that I recalled.%K%P

0x864
...%K%P

0x870
No...%K%N

0x87C
That's not right, is it...?%K%P

0x890
Okuhiko「Ishihara, you see...」%K%P

0x89C
Okuhiko「We were just pretending as if all your premonitions%Nturned out to be really true.」%K%P

0x8B0
The rice, battery, and dinner incidents were all secretly%Nplanned and fabricated by Okuhiko and Izumi-san.%K%P

0x8BC
If that's the case, then does that mean all of my other%Npremonitions were false as well...?%K%P

0x8D8
...%K%P

0x900
No way!%K%N

0x90C
That's impossible!%K%P

0x918
Then how do you explain the card incident?%K%P

0x924
What, am I supposed to believe that Izumi-san used a%Ntrick or something to do that? That's impossible!%K%P

0x930
And the biggest problem is the earthquake!%K%P

0x93C
Unless you have some large scale equipment, it's%Nimpossible to produce an earthquake of that size!%K%P

0x948
There's just too many things that you can't explain%Nsimply by saying "I was deceived"!%K%P

0x954
(Then...)%K%P

0x960
(Then, just which ones were real...?)%K%P

0x96C
(Which ones... which ones...?)%K%P

0x978
At my wits end, I writhe in agony.%K%P

0x984
This is all too confusing.%K%P

0x990
Just when I was starting to have a grasp on things,%Neverything falls apart and doesn't make any sense.%K%P

0x99C
Yuka「Hey, Makoto〜! Over here!」%K%P

0x9A8
I turn around, and see Yuka waving in front of Lunabeach.%K%P

0x9B4
Haruka, Okuhiko, and Kurumi have their backs turned to%Nme as they enter the shop.%K%P

0x9C0
(... Izumi-san... Izumi-san!)%K%P

0x9CC
Feeling like I could easily break into tears at any time, I%Nkick off the sand and break into a run...%K%P
