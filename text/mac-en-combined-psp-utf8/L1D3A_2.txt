Haruka and I begin to walk, enjoying the gentle breeze.%K%P

0x8C
I make an effort to talk about as many cheerful topics%Nas possible.%K%N

0x98
She doesn't respond often. I can't tell if she's%Nuninterested or just doesn't want to talk.%K%P

0xA4
Suddenly, Haruka grabs my arm.%K%N

0xB0
Turning my head around, I see her looking at me with a%Nserious expression.%K%P

0xBC
Her normally expressionless face is getting increasingly%Nintense, and it feels like her whole body is tensing up.%K%P

0xD0
Haruka「I kept my promise, didn't I?」%K

0x8A0
"Yeah, you did."

0x8AC
"... W-Well, yeah."

0x118
Makoto「Yeah, you did.」%K%P

0x124
I give Haruka the kindest smile I can muster.%K%P

0x130
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x13C
Haruka nods.%K%N

0x148
Her intense expression loosens up a bit.%K%N

0x154
She seems a little happy.%K%P

0x168
Seemingly pleased by my satisfactory response, the%Ntension in Haruka's body relaxes.%K%P

0x17C
Just then, Haruka is taken aback by noticing she is%Nholding my arm, so she lets go as she hangs her head%Ndown.%K%P

0x190
Makoto「... W-Well, yeah.」%K%P

0x19C
Haruka「Huh? Was that strange? Did I do something strange?」%K%P

0x1A8
Makoto「That's not it, but...」%K%P

0x1B4
Haruka「'But'... what?」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「Nothing... Anyway, yeah, you've kept your promise.」%K%P

0x1D4
I give her a smile, and the tension in her body lowers.%NShe is taken aback as she notices she's holding my arm,%Nand so she lets go, hanging her head downwards.%K%P

0x1E0
I see...%K%N

0x1EC
Haruka's like a child. She walks with the tottering steps%Nof one who knows nothing. I think it looks rather cute.%K%P

0x1F8
At that time, our eyes meet.%K%N

0x204
There's something strikingly beautiful about her%Nintensity, startling me.%K%N

0x210
It's a strange feeling that makes me feel kind of%Nunbalanced.%K%P

0x2B4
Once we arrive at the pier, I prepare all the fishing gear.%K%P

0x2C0
I absentmindedly eat the bread Haruka bought for us on%Nour way here.%K%P

0x2CC
It seems boring.%K%N

0x2D8
But keeping my promise to Haruka is the only important%Nthing to me at the moment, so I don't mind.%K%P

0x2E4
When I finish preparing the fishing gear, I hand one of the%Nrods to Haruka. She then casts her fishing line into the%Nsea.%K%N

0x2F0
I also cast mine, which settles down next to hers.%K%P

0x338
Haruka「What do I do from now on?」%K%P

0x344
Makoto「Wait for Mr. Enemy to take a nibble.」%K%P

0x350
Haruka「Mr. Enemy?」%K%P

0x35C
Makoto「I mean the fish.」%K%P

0x368
Haruka「I see... so I wait...」%K%P

0x374
Makoto「When your float sinks, the match begins.」%K%P

0x380
Haruka「Match?」%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「Right. That's why the fish is 'Mr. Enemy'.」%K%P

0x398
Haruka「I... don't understand...」%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x3B0
Haruka「I wonder if it's because I have no heart... that I don't%Nunderstand...」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「Those things aren't even remotely related. You kept%Nyour promise with me, right? Then it's clear you have a%Nhea... A-Ah, Haruka!」%K%P

0x3C8
Haruka's float sinks into the ocean!%K%N

0x3D4
The line is dragged down with intense strength, and%NHaruka instinctively pulls the rod with all her might. Mr.%NEnemy here seems to be a lightweight fish, so it's easily%Ncaught.%K%P

0x3E0
I take the agitated fish off the hook and show it to%NHaruka.%K%P

0x3EC
She takes it into her arms before she suddenly%Nreleases it back into the ocean.%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「Huh? Hey, what was that about?」%K%P

0x404
Haruka「It's... because I have no heart...」%K%P

0x410
Makoto「What are you saying? Did you let it go because you%Nwanted to save it?」%K%P

0x41C
Haruka「No... Because I have no heart, I let it escape.」%K%P

0x428
Makoto「Just what does that...」%K%P

0x434
Haruka「Humans struggle against each other because they%Nhave hearts, right?」%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x44C
Haruka「They kill each other because they have hearts, right?」%K%P

0x458
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x464
Haruka「The whole world is full of massacre... because people%Nhave hearts, right?」%K%P

0x470
Makoto「...」%K

0x8B8
I have no response.

0x8C4
"That's wrong."

0x4B0
I have no response.%K%P

0x4BC
That's because I thought she was right on mark. Haruka%Nplaces the fishing rod down, and gazes far off into the%Ndistance. She's starting to return to her cold,%Nexpressionless state...%K%P

0x4C8
"I've got to do something", "I've got to say something."%NThese thoughts rush through my head.%K%P

0x4D4
—But nothing will come out of my mouth. Trying to pass%Nmy silence off as boredom, I pick up Haruka's fishing%Nrod.%K%P

0x4E0
I place the bait on the end, and cast the line out to sea.%NThen, I pass it to Haruka, who firmly stares at me.%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「That's wrong.」%K%P

0x508
I object, though I don't have any clear answer.%K%P

0x514
If she asks me "why?", I won't know how to respond.%K%P

0x520
Haruka's words were right on the mark.%K%P

0x52C
Still, I hope she doesn't believe that.%K%P

0x538
I hope Haruka's whole interpretation of humans isn't%Nsolely based on that one awful aspect.%K%P

0x544
My hope is like a parent wishing that their child grows up%Nto be honest.%K%P

0x550
True, Haruka's thoughts aren't wrong.%K%N

0x55C
But humans are much more complex than just that.%K%P

0x568
Haruka「Why...?」%K%P

0x574
The question I've dreaded has finally come. I seek a%Ncompelling answer for Haruka.%K%P

0x580
—But nothing is coming out.%K%P

0x58C
Haruka is firmly staring at me, waiting for me to speak.%K%P

0x598
Makoto「F-From the start, people don't think about trying to kill%Neach other, but rather to try loving each other.」%K%P

0x5A4
What the hell am I saying?%K%P

0x5B0
Makoto「I'm sure that in the olden days, people thought about%Nloving each other and living in peace.」%K%P

0x5BC
Haruka「Loving each other...」%K%P

0x5C8
Makoto「That's right. It was a world full of peace...」%K%P

0x5D4
Haah... Why am I talking so high and mighty about this?%K%P

0x5E0
Why is it that I take the role of teacher who loves%Npreaching in this style whenever I'm with Haruka?"%K%P

0x5EC
Haruka「How long ago do you think those olden days were?」%K%P

0x5F8
Makoto「That's... um...」%K%P

0x604
Haruka「Have you ever read, 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'?」%K%P

0x610
Makoto「W-Well... a little...」%K%P

0x61C
I'm lying.%K%N

0x628
I've never read it, but it's the story of Princess Kaguya,%Nright?%K%N

0x634
For the time being, I'll pretend I know it.%K%P

0x640
Haruka「Princess Kaguya had her suitors compete against each%Nother by forcing unreasonable demands upon them,%Nright?」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「Yeah, that's right. They were to obtain certain treasures%Nfrom the ends of the earth to the peaks of mountains.」%K%P

0x658
Makoto「One of them had to retrieve a burning cloth, and another%Nhad to get the eye of a dragon. ... What about it?」%K%P

0x664
Haruka「That doesn't really matter...」%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Oh, I see...」%K%P

0x67C
I'm crushed. Even though I did my best to remember all of%Nthat...%K%P

0x688
Haruka「All I'm saying is that people in the olden days did%Ncompete against each other...」%K%P

0x694
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6A0
Haruka「The past you spoke of was probably a long, long time%Nago from now. A past as far away as a dream... far away...」%K%P

0x6AC
Makoto「N-No, that's... You see, the suitors' competition against%Neach other was the result of their love for Princess%NKaguya...」%K%P

0x6B8
Makoto「That's right, there's a chance that even Princess%NKaguya loved her suitors, and because of that, she did%Nthat kind of stuff to test their love...」%K%P

0x6C4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x6D0
Makoto「And they did. Because the suitors and Princess Kaguya%Nloved each other, they competed and tested. They did%Nthis probably to try to ascertain their feelings for each%Nother.」%K%P

0x6DC
Haruka「Try to ascertain...?」%K%P

0x73C
Haruka ponders over this.%K%N

0x748
Whether it's a good or bad thing, I don't think Haruka%Nunderstands this way of thinking.%K%P

0x754
I feel a little happy and lonely, like the feeling a father%Ngets when his daughter grows up and leaves the nest.%K%P

0x760
And then...%K%N

0x76C
Once again, Haruka's fishing line quickly drags towards%Nthe sea.%K%P

0x778
Makoto「Look, Haruka! You got another bite! Don't let it go!」%K%P

0x784
Haruka quickly grasps the fishing rod tightly.%K%N

0x790
As Haruka jerks the fishing rod backwards, the fish in%Nthe water swims from left to right.%K%P

0x79C
I go behind Haruka, and we pull on the fishing rod%Ntogether. Our hands are on top of each other. It%Nhappened so naturally... Haruka is wrapped up in pulling%Nthe fishing rod.%K%P

0x7A8
Like a father...%K%N

0x7B4
That's probably how I'm feeling right now. The feeling of%Nhoping a child grows up quickly while hoping that they%Nforever remain ignorant of the idea of love between a%Nman and woman.%K%P

0x7C0
Just like the current Haruka...%K%P

0x7CC
Haruka's serious face, which seems to be shining to me,%Nis something that I feel the want to protect.%K%P
