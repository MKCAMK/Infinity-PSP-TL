In the middle of the quiet, still forest, the only sound we%Nhear are our own footsteps that we make on this nightly%Nstroll.%K%P

0x4C
We're walking back to the lodge, with Izumi-san in the lead.%K%P

0x7C
Yuka「I'm so sweaty...」%K%P

0x88
Yuka frowns as she pinches her clothes, which have%Nstuck to her body.%K%P

0xA4
Okuhiko「You can say that again...」%K%P

0xB0
Okuhiko nods sympathetically at her statement. His face%Nseems a little pale.%K%P

0xBC
Is it due to the pale moonlight pouring down from the sky,%K%P

0xC8
or is it because of the fear he was feeling just a little%Nwhile ago...? Well, it doesn't really matter.%K%P

0xE4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xF0
Haruka alone says nothing.%K%P

0xFC
She walks behind the silent Izumi-san with a composed%Nexpression.%K%P

0x110
Makoto「Let's take showers when we get back.」%K%P

0x11C
I suggest this to my fellow Seminar Camp members.%K%P

0x128
Yuka and Okuhiko nod in agreement.%K%P

0x13C
Kurumi「Ah! Kurumi too, Kurumi too〜」%K%P

0x148
Kurumi, who's walking next to Haruka, is in high spirits%Nafter hearing us.%K%P

0x164
Izumi「Oh, right. There's actually an open air hot spring nearby.」%K%P

0x170
... As if she had been anticipating it, Izumi-san abruptly%Nturns around to inform us of this.%K%P

0x17C
Since she is at the head of the group, Haruka and Kurumi,%Nwho were walking right behind her, both crash their%Nfaces into Izumi's chest.%K%P

0x198
Kurumi「Geez〜, Onee-chan! Don't stop so suddenly〜」%K%P

0x1A4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1B0
Naturally, Kurumi reprimands Izumi-san.%K%P

0x1BC
Haruka silently shoots Izumi-san a flustered look as she%Nnurses her nose.%K%P

0x1C8
Izumi-san hastily apologizes, though her mind is clearly%Nstill on the hot springs. She looks at us with a face that%Nsays, "Do you want to go?"%K%P

0x1E4
Yuka「Huh? Really!? Hey, let's go there, guys!」%K%P

0x1F0
Yuka gets really excited.%K%P

0x1FC
Okuhiko and I nod as if to say "sounds good".%K%P

0x208
Haruka doesn't respond, but it doesn't seem like she%Nhas any particular objections against it.%K%P

0x25C
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x268
However, Kurumi silently hangs her head downwards, all%Nthe enthusiasm she had mere moments ago suddenly%Ngone.%K%P

0x290
Izumi「Kurumi... are you also okay?」%K%P

0x29C
She asked the question as if to make sure that Kurumi%Nwas ready for a solemn ritual to begin.%K%P

0x2A8
Izumi-san uneasily looks at Kurumi.%K%P

0x2BC
After a short while, Kurumi nods to Izumi-san while giving%Na sweet smile.%K%P

0x2D0
When she sees that, Izumi-san's expression suddenly%Nrelaxes and she nods back.%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「??」%K%P

0x320
Izumi「Incidentally...」%K%P

0x32C
Izumi「The hot springs are mixed bathing...」%K%P

0x340
Okuhiko「What!?」%K%P

0x34C
Upon hearing that, Okuhiko's face seems to light up.%K%P

0x358
He takes a fleeting, sidelong glance at Haruka... so it%Nseems, or is it just my imagination?%K%P

0x364
Makoto「That's... Say what you like, but don't you think that's a bit%Ntoo dangerous?」%K%P

0x370
Looking at Okuhiko, I feel kinda reluctant.%K%P

0x37C
It'll be like throwing sheep in front of a wolf...%K%P

0x390
Izumi「Hmm... Well, we have both men and women... Maybe it really%Nis too dangerous?」%K%P

0x39C
Izumi-san folds her arms with a troubled face upon%Nhearing my point.%K%P

0x3B8
Yuka「If we alternate going in between men and women, then%Nthere's no problem at all♪」%K%P

0x3C4
However, Yuka calmly declares this, not seeming to have%Nfussed over the matter.%K%P

0x3E0
Okuhiko「... Tch!」%K%P

0x3EC
Okuhiko clicks his tongue.%K%P

0x400
... It seems my fears weren't part of my imagination after%Nall.%K%P

0x40C
However, in the corners of my mind, I think that while I'm%Nrelieved, I also kinda would have liked it if we had gone in%Ntogether...%K%P

0x418
Guess I'm just a normal guy after all...%K%P

0x42C
Kurumi「No way, no way, that's not good. There's no guarantee%Nthat Onii-chan and Okkun won't try to peek!」%K%P

0x438
Kurumi seems to think that we'll definitely peek.%K%P

0x444
She doesn't have much faith in us, huh...%K%P

0x458
Izumi「Now that you mention it, there's a wall around that hot%Nspring, but it's completely tattered...」%K%P

0x46C
Yuka「Hmm... Well then, what if we went in in our swimsuits?」%K%P

0x478
Yuka「We can go back to get our swimsuits. Then once we've%Nchanged, we won't have to worry about getting peeked%Nat.」%K%P

0x494
Okuhiko「Oh! That's a nice idea, Yuka-chan♪」%K%P

0x4B0
Izumi「Hee hee hee... The truth is, I thought this might happen,%Nso I brought a swimsuit♪」%K%P

0x4C4
Kurumi「Eheheh〜♪」%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi-san gives an impish smile.%K%P

0x4DC
Kurumi is sticking her tongue out.%K%P

0x4E8
Was this their plan from the beginning?%K%P

0x4F4
It seems that they're having fun watching our reactions...%NThey're terrible.%K%P

0x510
Yuka「Well, it seems that we won't need to find anything to tie%NMakoto and Okuhiko-kun up to a tree...」%K%P

0x51C
Suddenly, Yuka throws out a ridiculous suggestion.%K%P

0x528
H-Hey, cut me a break...%K%P

0x544
Okuhiko「H-Have some faith in us...」%K%P

0x550
Okuhiko looks like he's about to cry.%K%P

0x55C
I probably look the same.%K%P

0x578
Yuka「Well, it was just a joke...」%K%P

0x58C
Yuka「Well then, it's decided〜♪」%K%P

0x598
Yuka「We'll each go in the lodge, get our swimsuits, and meet in%N20 minutes at the front door.」%K%P

0x5A4
But Yuka continues the conversation as if we're not%Neven there.%K%P

0x5B0
... Huh? Something's weird about this exchange.%K%P

0x5BC
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? I was thinking...」%K%P

0x5D0
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「In times like this, isn't it usually the girl who's reluctant to%Ngo to the hot springs, while the guy's the persuasive%None?」%K%P

0x5F0
Yuka「Now now, don't worry about it.」%K%P

0x5FC
With that, we once again head towards the lodge.%K%P

0x608
Yuka walks lightly, humming some song to herself.%K%P

0x684
Once we enter the lodge, we each head to our own%Nrooms to change.%K%P

0x690
Incidentally, Izumi-san and Kurumi are using Yuka and%NHaruka's rooms.%K%P

0x69C
Just when I'm about to enter my room...%K%P

0x6B0
Haruka stares firmly at Kurumi, and says this.%K%P

0x6BC
Haruka「Kurumi... you have pretty skin.」%K%P

0x6D0
Kurumi「Huh...!?」%K%P

0x6EC
Yuka「...? Something wrong, Kurumi-chan?」%K%P

0x6F8
Kurumi「N-No... it's nothing... Th-Thank you, Haruka-san...」%K%P

0x704
Haruka「...?」%K%P

0x718
Yuka「But it's true. Kurumi-chan, what do you say to me giving%Nyou a back wash?」%K%P

0x724
... Just then.%K%P

0x764
Kurumi's face suddenly freezes.%K%P

0x770
I hear Izumi-san give a taken aback gasp.%K%P

0x784
Kurumi「Ah... S-Sorry...」%K%P

0x790
Kurumi「Now that Kurumi thinks about it, Kurumi's got to watch%N'Oedo Gatten'.」%K%P

0x7A4
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x7B0
Yuka's eyes widen.%K%P

0x7BC
This unexpected event has also left me utterly%Nconfused.%K%P

0x7C8
Makoto「... Wh-What's wrong? Kuru...」%K%P

0x7D4
Kurumi「Ah... Kurumi's really sorry! She has to see it no matter%Nwhat...」%K%P

0x7E0
Kurumi「Umm... Right! If Kurumi doesn't watch it, she won't be able%Nto talk about it with her friends.」%K%P

0x7EC
Kurumi interrupts me, giving a desperate apology.%K%P

0x808
Izumi「... I see. Then it can't be helped. Kurumi...」%K%P

0x814
With a sad face, Izumi-san places a hand on Kurumi's%Nshoulder.%K%P

0x820
Kurumi「... Sorry, Onee-chan.」%K%P

0x82C
It seems like Kurumi could burst into tears at any time.%K%P

0x840
Izumi-san silently shakes her head.%K%P

0x84C
It's as if she's saying "It's fine..."%K%P

0x858
Izumi「Well then, we're going to the hot springs... Kurumi, please%Nwatch over the lodge.」%K%P

0x864
Kurumi「Yeah...」%K%P

0x880
... I then think:%K%P

0x894
... I then think:%K

0x2800
(What a TV addict...)

0x280C
(Kurumi... what's wrong?)

0x8D4
(In the end, Kurumi's also a TV addict, huh...?)%K%N

0x8E0
That thought runs through my head.%K%P

0x8F4
... ... ...%K%P

0x960
After changing our clothes, we all meet at the front door.%K%P

0x96C
Yuka「Well then, we're off, Kurumi-chan♪」%K%P

0x978
Kurumi watches us leave as we start walking towards%Nthe hot springs.%K%P

0x984
At first, Izumi-san wasn't that enthused,%K%P

0x990
but she gradually grew more cheerful, so I stopped%Nworrying about her.%K%P

0xA34
Soon enough, we're able to see something like steam%Nrising from our destination.%K%P

0xA40
I can smell the scent of sulfur mixed in the air.%K%P

0xA54
Haruka「It kind of... stinks.」%K%P

0xA68
Yuka「Makoto, farting in front of a girl... You're the worst.」%K%P

0xA74
Makoto「Dumbass! That's the smell of the hot springs, right?!」%K%P

0xA80
I pinch my nose and reproach Yuka.%K%P

0xA8C
Despite the stench, I keep moving forward.%K%P

0xAA8
Izumi「The one who first found this place was...」%K%P

0xABC
Okuhiko「By the way, my Papa also owns a hot spring...」%K%P

0xAC8
Izumi-san is talking about the hot spring.%K%P

0xAD4
Okuhiko interrupts to brag.%K%P

0xAE0
We ignore him as we advance towards the hot spring%Nthrough the forest.%K%P

0xBCC
The hot spring isn't very far.%K%P

0xBD8
We arrive there in under five minutes.%K%P

0xBE4
It's an isolated, natural hot spring surrounded by rocks,%Nlying in the middle of the forest.%K%P

0xBF0
In this chilly night, the enveloping steam coming from the%Nmilky white hot water seems very promising.%K%P

0xC70
Yuka「Wow♪ It kinda looks like a bath where you'd find a%Nbathhouse prostitute...」%K%P

0xC84
Haruka「... Bathhouse prostitute?」%K%P

0xC90
Yuka「You don't know what those are, Haruka? Let's see...」%K%P

0xC9C
Makoto「Idiot! Don't tell what's best left unknown!」%K%P

0xCB0
Yuka「Hey, what the hell?!」%K%P

0xCCC
Ignoring the sulking Yuka, I turn my attention to Izumi-san,%Nwho's beginning to explain about the hot springs.%K%P

0xCD8
It seems no one knows who's the manager and owner of%Nthese natural hot springs.%K%P

0xCE4
A wall had been built around the hot spring, but it's%Nrotted away to the point where it's riddled with gaps...%K%P

0xCF0
You really could peek here as much as you liked.%K%P

0xD0C
Yuka「Is this hot spring even safe to use?」%K%P

0xD20
Izumi「... Huh? Who knows...」%K%P

0xD34
Yuka「Huh? You don't know?」%K%P

0xD48
Izumi「No. But it's all right. I at least know it's not poisonous to%Nthe body...」%K%P

0xD5C
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0xD68
I get a little worried when I start to consider how much of%Na ditz Izumi-san can be.%K%P

0xD74
Well, we probably won't die, but...%K%P

0xDC8
Yuka「Well then, I'll go first!」%K%P

0xDE8
Makoto「Whoa!!」%K%P

0xDF4
Suddenly, Yuka takes off her clothes. I knew she was%Ngoing to do it, but it's still shocking.%K%P

0xE08
Yuka「...? Something wrong?」%K%P

0xE14
Makoto「... No, it's nothing.」%K%P

0xE20
Yuka「... I see. Well, whatever.」%K%P

0xE2C
Yuka delicately dips her foot in the hot spring, like most%Ngirls would...%K%P

0xED0
... before she suddenly dives into the hot spring with a%Nsplash.%K%P

0xEF8
Yuka「Mmm, the water temperature is really good♪」%K%P

0xF04
Haah〜... Geez, you're such a kid.%K%P

0xF2C
Soon enough, everyone takes off their clothes one by%None and enters the hot spring.%K%P

0xF38
Well then... should I enter as well?%K%P

0xF64
... ... ...%K%P

0xF9C
... It's been ten minutes since I've entered.%K%N

0xFA8
I feel more and more like I'm boiling up.%K%N

0xFB4
Aah〜... I'm completely relaxed...%K%P

0xFC0
Well then, I'll...%K

0x2818
(Whew...) Sit up on the edge of a rock.

0x2824
(Duh duh duh dah duh♪) Sing.

0x2830
(Whoosh〜 Whoosh...) Start breast stroking.

0x283C
(Good enough!) Simply bask in the water.

0x1070
*SPLASH!* I sit on the edge of a rock.%K%P

0x107C
The gentle night's breeze feels pleasant and cool%Nagainst my burning hot skin.%K%P

0x1088
Makoto「Whew...」%K%P

0x1094
Only the top half of my body is exposed to the cold%Nwind, as my lower half is still submerged in the hot water.%K%P

0x10A0
This is the true charm of open air hot springs!%K%P

0x10AC
Haah〜... But this seriously feels good. I wonder how%Nmany years it's been since going in a bath has made me%Nfeel so good.%K%P

0x10B8
Now that I think about it, we've done a lot of different%Nthings at this camp, but it's all felt so peaceful.%K%P

0x10C4
... At that time, I hear Okuhiko's voice.%K%P

0x10D0
He's apparently talking to someone.%K%P

0x10DC
I quietly turn my head in the direction of his voice.%K%P

0x10E8
... There he is. Soon, I also see Haruka. The two of them%Nhave their shoulders submerged in the hot water.%K%P

0x10F4
Okuhiko is relentlessly trying to talk to Haruka.%K%P

0x1100
Well, as always, Haruka is staying silent, but...%K%P

0x110C
She looks gloomy. I don't know why, but that's the feeling%NI get.%K%P

0x1144
All right! If that's the case... Then I've got an excellent%Nplan to help her out... Time to put my ingenious plot into%Naction.%K%P

0x1150
I roll up a towel that's full of air...%K%P

0x115C
I then sink it into the hot water until it's at level with my%Nlower back...%K%P

0x1168
... And now I'm ready.%K%P

0x1174
Weapon in hand, I approach them. *Splash, splash,%Nsplash*...%K%P

0x1180
The two of them watch me.%K%P

0x1200
Okuhiko glares at me, clearly disgusted by my behavior.%K%P

0x120C
Makoto「... Ugh!」%K%P

0x1218
I try to ignore him, but I can't help but groan.%K%P

0x1224
With that, I squeeze the air out the submerged towel,%Nforming bubbles that rise just above the back of my%Nwaist, making it look like the air came from a certain other%Nplace.%K%P

0x1230
*Bubble bubble bubble*...%K%P

0x1260
Okuhiko「WHAAA...!!!」%K%P

0x126C
Paralyzed, Okuhiko's eyes widen to the size of plates.%NHis mouth opens wider than I ever thought was possible.%K%P

0x1278
Haruka「Okuhiko's... mouth is huge...」%K%P

0x1284
Makoto「Yeah. It's so big that I think you could stuff an entire%Nwash basin in there.」%K%P

0x1298
In response to Haruka's statement, I compare my wash%Nbasin with Okuhiko's face and nod.%K%P

0x12A4
Okuhiko「Eee...」%K%P

0x12B0
Haruka「??」%K%P

0x12C4
Okuhiko「EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!」%K%P

0x12D8
*Splash Splash Splash...!!!*%K%P

0x12E4
While plucking his nose, Okuhiko screams and runs away.%K%P

0x12F8
Haruka「??」%K%P

0x1304
Haruka blinks with surprise while watching Okuhiko.%K%P

0x1310
She probably didn't get it.%K%P

0x131C
Well, that was an extremely predictable joke, but...%K%P

0x1328
Haruka「... Hey, what's wrong with Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x1334
Makoto「... Who knows?」%K%P

0x1350
... ... ...%K%P

0x1378
Our silence continues for a short while.%K%P

0x1384
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1390
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x139C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x13A8
Makoto「Say, Haruka...」%K%P

0x13B4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x13C0
Unable to bear the silence any longer, I try to strike up a%Nconversation.%K%P

0x13CC
... But she doesn't respond.%K%P

0x13D8
Makoto「... Haruka?」%K%P

0x13EC
Haruka「Aah〜... *boil boil boil*...」%K%P

0x1474
Makoto「HEY!? Haruka!」%K%P

0x1480
When I wasn't paying attention, her face turned bright%Nred...%K%P

0x148C
If she's gotten this bad, then she shouldn't have stayed%Nin for so long.%K%P

0x1498
Right now, my main priority is to get Haruka out of the%Nwater.%K%P

0x14A4
I pull up the sinking Haruka, and hold her in my arms.%K%P

0x14B0
I feel light headed and dizzy from the sensation of her%Nsoft skin transmitting through my hands, but I somehow%Nmanage to carry her until I find a place with a good%Nbreeze.%K%P

0x14BC
I look at Haruka's face as I place her against the wall%Nwhere our clothes are.%K%P

0x14C8
*Badump, badump...*%K%P

0x14E4
Haruka「Haah... haah...」%K%P

0x14F0
It's quiet, but Haruka starts slowly breathing in and out.%K%P

0x14FC
I desperately continue to watch her.%K%P

0x1554
And then, by pure chance, Yuka passes by.%K%P

0x1560
Makoto「Oh, Yuka! Good timing! Help me out, Haruka just...」%K%P

0x156C
I talk up til that point, then swallow my words.%K%P

0x15A4
Her face is flushed red like a lobster, her eyes are all%Nunfocused, her gait is all staggered with no sense of%Nbalance, and... she has sake in her hand.%K%P

0x15B0
DAAAA...!! She's drunk!!%K%P

0x15C4
Yuka「Wah, whash rong? Mako-tan?」%K%P

0x15D0
Yuka「... Oooh? Ish shomefing up wif Haruka-tan?」%K%P

0x15DC
This isn't good... As she is now, she can't help me at all...%K%P

0x15E8
I ignore the plastered Yuka, and immediately return all of%Nmy focus to the panting Haruka's face...%K%P

0x1658
Makoto「Duh duh duh duh dah duh♪」%K%P

0x1664
Because I'm in such a good mood, I start singing.%K%P

0x1670
Haah〜... But this seriously feels good. I wonder how%Nmany years it's been since going in a bath has made me%Nfeel so good.%K%P

0x167C
Now that I think about it, we've done a lot of different%Nthings in this camp, but it's all felt so peaceful.%K%P

0x1688
... I start to drift off to sleep, lulled by these thoughts.%NJust then...%K%P

0x16A4
??「Hey! Yer sho noishee〜」%K%P

0x16B0
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x16BC
I am brought back to reality.%K%P

0x16C8
... Whose voice was that?%K%P

0x16D4
Yuka「Shaddahp〜 Yuu... tone-deaf〜」%K%P

0x16E0
No doubt about it... it's Yuka. But her voice is extremely%Nslurred. Oh god, please don't be what I think she is...%K%P

0x16EC
Just then, a gust of wind blows by. It dispels the steam%Nfloating before my eyes.%K%P

0x1788
I can see the shadow of a person on the other side. As I%Nthought, it's Yuka.%K%P

0x1794
She is floating in the water like a lantern during the Bon%NFestival, gulping down some sake.%K%P

0x17A0
(Sh-She's drinking even in a place like this...)%K%P

0x17B4
Yuka「Nyahahahahahaha... *Gulp, gulp〜*」%K%P

0x17C0
She's considerably drunk. If she doesn't stop soon,%Nthings could get ugly...%K%P

0x17CC
*Splash, splash, splash*...%K%P

0x17D8
I quickly approach Yuka.%K%P

0x17F4
Haah〜... But this seriously feels good. I wonder how%Nmany years it's been since going in a bath has made me%Nfeel so good.%K%P

0x1800
Now that I think about it, we've done a lot of different%Nthings in this camp, but it's all felt so peaceful.%K%P

0x180C
*Whoosh, whoosh...* I spontaneously begin breast%Nstroking.%K%P

0x1818
Normally, doing this would piss someone off, but since%Nit's just us, I suppose it's all right.%K%P

0x1824
??「Hey yuu〜!」%K%P

0x1830
... Scratch that. I really did piss someone off.%K%P

0x18C4
Yuka「Shtop meikin' weifsh〜. It'll shpill!」%K%P

0x18D0
... Huh? Spill? What will?%K%P

0x18E4
*Splash Splash Splash...*%K%P

0x18F0
Makoto「... Gwaa!」%K%P

0x18FC
I get surprised when I see something approaching me!%K%P

0x1908
Yuka's floating in the water like a lantern during the Bon%NFestival, gulping down some sake.%K%P

0x1914
(E-Even in a place like this...)%K%P

0x1920
Yuka「*Gulp, gulp*... Kyuu〜!」%K%P

0x1934
Yuka「Ash eye fought, hot shpringsh ah de besht! Ishen't dat%Nrite, Mako-tan?」%K%P

Yuka says this with a flushed face. How am I supposed%Nto respond to this!?%K%P

0x194C
If her parents saw this, they'd probably cry... No, if I were%Nher father, I'd definitely weep.%K%P

0x1958
She's extremely drunk...%K%P

0x1964
If I don't stop her now, things could get ugly...%K%P

0x1970
Well then... How should I stop her...?%K

0x2848
Start out nice.

0x2854
Start out forceful.

0x2860
Get angry.

0x19C0
I decide to try being nice.%K%P

0x19CC
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? If you drink so much, you'll poison your body.%NBe a good girl and sto... Whoa!」%K%P

0x19D8
I am unable finish my speech.%K%N

0x19E4
Yuka suddenly trips me!%K%N

0x19F0
I pitch forward and fall...%K%P

0x1A20
I fall prostrate into the water, making a splendid sound. I%Naccidentally drink a large amount of water.%K%P

0x1A2C
*Splash* *Cough, cough, cough!*%K%P

0x1A38
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1A4C
Yuka「Nyahahahahaha...♪ Yer show derty!」%K%P

0x1A58
Tears rise in Yuka's eyes as she laughs her ass off.%K%P

0x1A64
*Twitch, twitch...!* Y-You little...!!%K%N

0x1A70
Blood is rushing to my head...%K%N

0x1A7C
... No, hold on.%K%P

0x1A88
My opponent is a drunkard. What do I have to do to make%Nthis drunkard take me seriously?%K%P

0x1A94
I regain my calm, and decide to try one more time, making%Nmy assault a little more forceful this time.%K%P

0x1AA0
Makoto「Yuka〜? Haven't you had enough to drink? Come on,%Nhand it over...」%K%P

0x1AAC
I try to forcefully snatch the cup of sake out of Yuka's%Nhand.%K%P

0x1AC0
Yuka「Hmm? ... NAAAAAAH〜〜WEEEEEEEI!!!」%K%P

0x1ACC
Just then, Yuka grabs my outstretched arm, and drags%Nme into the hot water.%K%P

0x1AFC
I fall prostrate into the water, making a splendid sound.%K%P

0x1B08
A lot of hot water goes flooding into my nose.%K%P

0x1B14
*Splash*%K%P

0x1B20
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1B34
Yuka「Nyahahahahahahahahahaha...♪ Yer feish ish funee〜」%K%P

0x1B40
She holds her stomach with laughter...%K%P

0x1B4C
She splashes hot water on me to add even more salt to%Nthe wound.%K%P

0x1B58
Y-You... bitch...!!%K%N

0x1B64
... I decide to forcefully cut in.%K%P

0x1B70
Makoto「Dammit! You're so drunk!!」%K%P

0x1B84
Yuka「!?」%K%P

0x1B90
Yuka stares in puzzlement at my raised voice.%K%P

0x1B9C
(Huh? Did she understand that?)%K%P

0x1BA8
Just as I'm thinking this, Yuka cuts her way through the%Nhot water and gets behind me.%K%P

0x1C30
And then, Yuka suddenly walks up behind me and wraps%Nher arms around me!%K%P

0x1C3C
(WH... WHAA!!?)%K%P

0x1C48
Makoto「Y-Yuka!? ... Th-This is bad... in a place like this...」%K%P

0x1C54
I become extremely flustered.%K%P

0x1C60
... No, but that was a misunderstanding even bigger than%NMt. Fuji.%K%P

0x1C6C
As she wraps her arms around me, Yuka puts even more%Npower into them, starting to strangle me.%K%P

0x1C78
My neck is...%K%P

0x1C84
Makoto「Ug... ghhh...」%K%P

0x1C90
Yuka「Wai yuu! Hoosh de drunk wan heer!!」%K%P

0x1C9C
Makoto「Wh... Who... there's no one else... but you...」%K%P

0x1CA8
I was careless... She must have some really bad drinking%Nhabits to go this far...!%K%P

0x1CB4
I desperately try to resist her, but...%K%P

0x1CC0
Yuka「Eyam〜 ... NAHT DRUNNNNNK〜〜!」%K%P

0x1CCC
*Griiiiiiiiiind...*%W%W

0x1CD8
With my consciousness fading, I...%K%P

0x1CE4
(Yuka's... got a nice chest...)%K%P

0x1CF0
... think this incredibly healthy thought.%K%P

0x1D58
... ... ...%K%P

0x1D74
Woohoo〜〜! This is nothing!!%K%P

0x1D80
It's not like anyone's watching, so I decide to start an%Nendurance contest with myself.%K%P

0x1D8C
But that quickly turns out to be a mistake.%K%P

0x1DA8
... Ah, c-crap.%K%P

0x1DB4
M-My consciousness is fading... Kuh...%K%P

0x1E0C
... *ACK!*%K%N

0x1E18
... ... ...%K%P

0x1E80
... After I lose consciousness, I have a dream.%K%P

0x1E8C
In the dream, I'm an octopus being boiled to death in a%Npot...%K%P

0x1E98
It was such a tragic dream.%K%P

0x1F04
When I regain consciousness, the first thing I see is%NIzumi-san's worried face.%K%P

0x1F10
I then notice that it's not just her; everybody else has%Nsurrounded me, concerned looks on their faces.%K%P

0x1F24
Izumi「... Are you all right?」%K%P

0x1F30
She asks me this gently.%K%P

0x1F3C
My head is on top of Izumi-san's thighs! So in other%Nwords, I was sleeping on her lap!!%K%P

0x1F48
Aah... I'm so happy I could die...%K%P

0x1F54
I get intoxicated from the feeling of Izumi-san's thighs%Nagainst the back of my head.%K%P

0x1F60
It seems I was pulled from the hot spring after I fainted.%K%P

0x1F6C
Everyone else is worried about me.%K%P

0x1F90
... Well, there's one "exception."%K%P

0x1FC0
Only the flush-faced Yuka is reprimanding me in a%Ndrunken voice.%K%P

0x1FCC
It seems she got drunk even in a place like this.%K%P

0x1FD8
As expected of a drunkard, she reprimands me in a%Nrather nasty way.%K%P

0x1FE4
Yuka「Paa〜fetic〜 ... Yer a guy, aren't yuu?!」%K%P

0x200C
She pokes me hard on the forehead as she asks this.%K%P

0x2018
Makoto「Gwa! That hurt〜!」%K%P

0x2024
S-Someone stop her...%K%P

0x2030
Grief ridden tears flow out of my eyes...%K%P

0x20CC
After our night out, we return to the lodge a little past%N11:00.%K%P

0x20D8
It had been a refreshing, though exhausting, experience.%K%P

0x20E4
I fall into a deep sleep the moment I climb into bed...%K%P

0x2158
(Kurumi... what's wrong?)%K%P

0x2164
It's really bugging me...%K%P
