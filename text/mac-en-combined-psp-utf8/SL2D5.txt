The next morning... I wake up, kill time in the living room for%Na little while, then head for Saki's summer house.%K%P

0x160
The time is "10:12 A.M."%K%N

0x16C
It should be at this exact time that the puppy comes%Nover to see Saki.%K%P

0x178
When I head around to the backyard, I see Saki feeding%Nthe puppy, just as expected.%K%P

0x184
The puppy devours the food while happily wagging its%Ntail.%K%P

0x190
Makoto「Yo, Saki!」%K%P

0x19C
I cheerfully call out to her.%K%P

0x1E8
Saki「M-Makoto-kun...!」%K%P

0x1F4
Makoto「That puppy's as energetic as always, huh?」%K%P

0x200
Saki「...」%K%P

0x20C
Saki gets flustered as she desperately searches for%Nwords.%K%P

0x218
Before Saki can say anything, I speak first.%K%P

0x224
Makoto「It's all right. Don't say anything...」%K%P

0x230
Makoto「I've known this whole time that you've been taking care%Nof this puppy...」%K%P

0x23C
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「I also know that on the 1st, you ordered the pizza for%Nthat puppy's sake.」%K%P

0x254
Makoto「And also... I might also know why you like animals and%Nplants...」%K%P

0x260
Saki「...」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「You can't trust people... but animals and plants don't tell%Nlies... right?」%K%P

0x280
Saki「That's right. They don't speak words. They don't need to.」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「But Saki... Don't you think that's a little wrong?」%K%P

0x298
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「The Magician's Portrait...」%K%P

0x2E4
Saki「!!!」%K%P

0x2F0
Saki instantly trembles in shock, and turns towards me.%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「It was during your cultural festival in middle school, ri-」%K%P

0x310
Saki「Did you hear about it from Yuka...?」%K%P

0x31C
I slowly nod. It's partially a lie...%K%P

0x328
In this timeline, I never heard the story from Yuka.%K%P

0x334
However, she told it to me last time...%K%P

0x348
Saki「I... I wanted... to look at it all alone.」%K%P

0x354
Saki's eyes fill with tears...%K%P

0x360
Saki「I just wanted to see it alone when no one was around!」%K%P

0x374
The instant she says this, large tears pour from her%Neyes.%K%P

0x380
She tries to control herself by standing rigidly as if%Nshe's rooted into the ground, but her thin shoulders%Nquiver.%K%P

0x38C
She clenches her hands into tight fists.%K%P

0x398
The tears flying off her face... fall onto those small fists.%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「The magician Yuka drew... was really incredible, wasn't it?」%K%P

0x3B0
Saki looks at me.%K%P

0x3BC
Her gaze is filled with loneliness.%K%P

0x3C8
Saki nods while biting her lip.%K%P

0x3D4
New tears overflow in her eyes.%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「Hey, Saki? I know the truth...」%K%P

0x3FC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x408
Makoto「You weren't running away because you destroyed the%Npainting...」%K%P

0x41C
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0x428
Makoto「It's because you just... didn't want anyone to see you%Ncrying...」%K%P

0x458
Saki「...」%K%P

0x464
Makoto「... Right?」%K%P

0x470
Saki gives a lonely nod and mutters this.%K%P

0x47C
Saki「The only ones who will listen to what I have to honestly%Nsay is this stray cat who lives at my school and this%Ncherry blossom tree on my campus...」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「... You're wrong, Saki...」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「There's one more person you can talk honestly to...」%K%P

0x4A0
Saki「...?」%K%P

0x4AC
Makoto「He's right here.」%K%P

0x4B8
Saki「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「You don't need words...」%K%P

0x4D0
Makoto「I'll become the cat and the cherry blossom tree.」%K%P

0x4DC
Tears fill up Saki's eyes yet again.%K%P

0x4E8
I embrace Saki without a word.%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「That's enough. I don't want to see you cry...」%K%P

0x508
Makoto「I told you before- I trust you, Saki.」%K%P

0x514
Makoto「And from now on, I'll continue to trust you...」%K%P

0x520
Makoto「No matter what happens... I will only trust you... forever...」%K%P

0x52C
Saki nods while burying her face into my chest.%K%P

0x538
Yes... that's right...%K%P

0x544
No matter what happens, no matter what anyone says, I%Nwon't repeat the same mistake.%K%P

0x550
I'll definitely continue to believe in Saki...!%K%P

0x55C
I swear this to myself.%K%P

0x5C4
Before long, the day ends... Izumi-san and Kurumi come%Nover to the lodge to sleep over.%K%P

0x5D0
The sisters are as cheerful as ever.%K%P

0x5DC
Saki doesn't act rude towards them and has fun.%K%P

0x5E8
Yuka also doesn't seem bothered about the "Magician's%NPortrait" incident, too.%K%P

0x5F4
Actually, it might be better to say that it's possible that%Nshe's completely forgotten about it.%K%P

0x600
So as long as the bell itself doesn't show up, there'll be%Nnothing to remind me of those unpleasant memories of%Nmine.%K%P

0x60C
The right way for me to live is probably for me to leave all%Nthose negative things behind me.%K%P

0x618
... That's what I think.%K%P

0x640
Just like last time, Izumi-san came here carrying her%Nbulging handbag around her arm.%K%P

0x64C
Of course, inside it is today's earnings from Lunabeach.%K%P

0x658
The fateful day has finally arrived.%K%P

0x664
Sometime between tonight and tomorrow's sunrise,%Nsomeone will probably come and steal all our money.%K%P

0x670
This time, I'll prove Saki's innocence!%K%P

0x67C
If I do that, then that incident tomorrow shouldn't happen!%K%P

0x688
I sit down by myself on the living room sofa, deciding to%Nstand watch all night.%K%P

0x694
Everyone else is in their own rooms. Only Saki went back,%Nreturning to her summer house.%K%P

0x6A0
From Yuka's room, I can hear the sounds of girls' cheerful%Nvoices.%K%P

0x6AC
As I listen to them chatter, I determinedly continue to wait%Nfor the real criminal to show up...%K%P
