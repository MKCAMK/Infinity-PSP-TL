I reach Saki's house, but as expected, she doesn't%Ncome out when I ring the doorbell.%K%N

0x68
I decide to try shouting.%K%P

0x74
Makoto「Heeey, Sakiii.」%K%P

0x80
Makoto「Sakiiiiii.」%K%P

0x8C
Makoto「Sakiiiii.」%K%P

0x98
Makoto「Saki-chaaaan.」%K%P

0xA4
No response. Damn, what should I do...?%K

0x8D8
I'll just give up.

0x8E4
Break in.

0xE4
It can't be helped. I'll give up on Saki and just go to the%NTest of Courage with the others.%K%P

0x128
My mind made up, I begin to survey the building's%Nperimeter by circling it.%K%N

0x134
I wander aimlessly, looking for an entrance...%K%P

0x140
Makoto「!!」%K%P

0x154
Saki「What the hell are you doing? I'll call the cops on you!」%K%P

0x160
Saki appears out of the back door.%K%P

0x16C
Makoto「Wait a minute! I want to talk to you!」%K%P

0x178
Saki「Well, I don't!」%K%P

0x18C
Saki gives me a "hmph", and tries to slam the door shut.%K%N

0x198
Just before the door closes, I grab Saki's arm, and%Nforcibly pull her towards me.%K%P

0x1AC
Saki「Don't touch me!」%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「Hey... how did you know that Haruka was a clone?」%K%P

0x1CC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「It has something to do with what happened yesterday,%Nright?」%K%P

0x1E4
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1F0
Makoto「I'm talking about what happened by the ocean. You%Nremember, don't you?」%K%P

0x204
Saki「...」%K%P

0x210
Makoto「What happened?」%K%P

0x21C
Saki「She still had that thing... that's why...」%K%P

0x228
Makoto「That thing?」%K%P

0x234
Saki「That's why I took it from her!」%K%P

0x240
Makoto「What's 'that thing'?」%K%P

0x24C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x258
Makoto「Hey, Saki!」%K%P

0x264
I try to press further as I shake her shoulders.%K%P

0x270
But then...%K%P

0x27C
Saki「No!!」%K%P

0x290
... Saki shakes my arm off and retreats into her summer%Nhouse.%K%P

0x29C
I think to immediately go after her and try to open the%Nback door, but then...%K%P

0x2E0
I hear a small growl when a sharp pain spreads%Nthroughout my leg.%K%P

0x2EC
Makoto「Ow!!」%K%P

0x2F8
I look and see the perpetrator is a slightly dirty dog. It's%Nan extremely small puppy, clearly only a few months old%Nat most.%K%P

0x304
Makoto「Damn it, get off of me!」%K%P

0x310
I desperately tear the puppy off of my leg.%K%P

0x338
When it realizes what I'm doing, it lets out a strangely%Nsweet growl.%K%P

0x344
I get the sense that the dog isn't going to budge even a%Nstep, so I can't advance into the house.%K%P

0x350
Makoto「You bastard!」%K%P

0x35C
The puppy and I continue to glare at each other ... but in%Nthe end, I lose.%K%P

0x368
It's pointless to get pissed off at such a small dog.%K%P

0x374
Makoto「Damn it, if I'd known it would end up like this, then I would%Nhave gone to the Test of Courage after all...」%K%P

0x380
I grumble to myself, then calm down the dog and leave%Nthrough the backyard.%K%P

0x404
When return to the lodge, I contemplate the situation in%Nsolitude.%K%P

0x410
(Saki and Haruka... what did they fight about on the pier%Nyesterday...?)%K%P

0x41C
(Just what is "that thing"?)%K%P

0x428
Suddenly, the ruined basket on the table catches my%Neyes.%K%P

0x434
Saki's now smashed basket.%K%P

0x440
I remember the image of Saki stomping on the basket in%Nher anger.%K%P

0x44C
Makoto「The basket, huh...」%K%P

0x4B4
(...)%K%P

0x4C0
(...)%K%P

0x4CC
(...)%K%P

0x4F4
How much time has passed...?%K%P

0x500
When I come to, I'm holding the basket while lying down in%Nmy room.%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「It's completely busted, but...」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「I wonder... can I fix this...?」%K%P

0x524
Maybe I should fix the basket and return it to Saki...%K

0x8F0
Repair it and return it.

0x8FC
I can't repair it.

0x56C
(All right! It won't be easy, but I'll try fixing this!)%K%P

0x578
I begin to repair Saki's broken basket.%K%P

0x584
To me, this is a step towards trying to sway Saki.%K%P

0x590
When she sees the fixed basket, Saki will be like...%K%P

0x5B8
Saki「Wow, thank you. This is my favorite basket; I'm glad you%Nfixed it. Honestly, I was worried about what I was going to%Ndo with it, but you're quite the handy one.」%K%P

0x5C4
Makoto「No, it wasn't that big of a deal.」%K%P

0x5D0
Saki「No, This kind of thing can't be replaced with money.」%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「Is that so? Things like this should be treated with care.」%K%P

0x5E8
Saki「I know that quite well... And to think I said all those the%Nthings to you yesterday... I'm very sorry.」%K%P

0x5F4
Makoto「I understand. It's all right...」%K%P

0x610
... Something like that should happen.%K%N

0x61C
I guess I'll apologize first, though. After that, I don't think%Nit'll be any different from receiving a gentle scolding. I'm%Nso smart... yep, yep.%K%P

0x628
However, perhaps this wasn't such a good idea. Instead%Nof fixing the basket, I think I'm only making the damage%Nworse.%K%P

0x634
Screw it... As I'm about to put away the basket, Kurumi%Nsuddenly comes into the room.%K%P

0x648
I frantically try to hide the basket... but it's too late.%K%P

0x654
Her interest piqued, Kurumi comes closer. Oh well... I'll%Nexplain the situation.%K%P

0x660
Makoto「... Guess I might seem a little full of myself, though...」%K%P

0x690
Kurumi「Onii-chan, you're great!」%K%P

0x69C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x6A8
Kurumi「Kurumi is deeply moved!」%K%P

0x6B4
Makoto「R-Really?」%K%P

0x6C0
Kurumi「This is definitely important to Saki-san. Kurumi%Nunderstands that. But Onii-chan, you're only breaking it%Nmore this way.」%K%P

0x6CC
Makoto「... True.」%K%P

0x6D8
Kurumi「Okay then. Since Kurumi appreciates your sentiment,%Nshe'll fix it for you.」%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「It's fine, Kurumi. You don't have to...」%K%P

0x6F8
Kurumi「She'll do it. Let her do it. She wants to do it.」%K%P

0x704
Makoto「Why?」%K%P

0x710
Kurumi「Because... Kurumi feels sorry for Saki-san.」%K%P

0x71C
Makoto「You feel sorry for her..? But Kurumi, Saki was the one who%Npushed you earlier, right?」%K%P

0x730
Kurumi「That's why Kurumi feels sorry for her. You don't%Nunderstand. She didn't mean to do it.」%K%P

0x73C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x748
Kurumi「Ah, geez! Anyway, Kurumi will take care of this!」%K%P

0x75C
Kurumi throws me a glance as I dumbfoundedly watch her%Nleave with the basket.%K%P

0x768
I'm worried about whether Kurumi can fix it or not, but then%Nagain, I doubt I could do a better job than she can.%K%P

0x774
I decide to leave the basket to Kurumi, and drift off to%Nsleep...%K%P

0x788
Makoto「I don't think I can do it...」%K%P

0x794
I give up on repairing the basket.%K%P

0x7A0
(But everyone sure is late in coming back.)%K%P

0x7AC
I drift off to sleep with this thought lingering in my mind...%K%P
