Even though Yuka had said it would only take her about%Nfifteen minutes, it's been almost an hour.%K%P

0x68
Just what the hell is Yuka cooking in there anyway?%K%P

0x74
It's now almost 11, so it's too late to even call it brunch.%K%P

0x80
While waiting, the three of us decided to wash our faces%Nand change our clothes.%K%P

0x8C
Currently, we are watching the TV that's sitting in the%Ncorner of the room.%K%P

0x98
There's a health show on called "A Healthy YOUtopia."%K%P

0xA4
Judging from its subtitle, "Good Green Vegetables To%NEat," it's basically a cooking show.%K%P

0xB0
Of course, none of us want to watch this.%K%P

0xBC
Unfortunately, this island only has two channels, both of%Nwhich are local broadcasting.%K%P

0xC8
The other channel happens to be featuring a short%Ndocumentary on "Natural Streams All Over the Country."%K%P

0xD4
Though both of the shows are boring, I think the one%Nabout streams might have been a better candidate for%Ndistracting us from our hunger.%K%P

0xE0
My stomach is rumbling. I don't think I can last much%Nlonger.%K%P

0xF4
Yuka「Sorry to keep you waiting〜」%K%P

0x100
Finally, Yuka peeks her head out from the kitchen.%K%P

0x10C
Yuka「I've already set the food on the table. Let's eat!」%K%P

0x128
At these words, Haruka immediately stands up.%K%P

0x134
I'm kind of surprised.%K%P

0x148
I find it odd that the usually indifferent Haruka is this%Ndetermined about eating breakfast.%K%P

0x154
I guess she must be practically starving.%K%P

0x18C
Upon arriving at the table, our eyes widen.%K%P

0x198
Our wondrous vision of food rivaling a 4-star restaurant%Nin Southern France...%K%N

0x1A4
... is gloriously shattered into pieces.%K%P

0x1B8
There's a "Mysterious Object" that I've never seen%Nbefore in my life heaped up into a pile at the center of%Nthe table.%K%P

0x1C4
Next to that are four plates with toast (T-That thing... IS%Ntoast... right?) placed on them.%K%P

0x1D0
As if it had come from outer space, this "Mystery%NObject" has a complicated and mysterious pattern of%Nspots, and is shaped like some kind of viscous jelly mold.%K%P

0x1DC
As for Yuka's "toast", it's a solid black mass (It might as%Nwell be called "charcoal"...).%K%P

0x1E8
Yuka「Well then, go ahead and eat up〜♪」%K%P

0x204
Yuka urges us on with a large, proud smile.%K%P

0x210
At the same time, she takes the "Mysterious Object",%Nplaces it on the "Charcoal", and smacks her lips.%K%P

0x21C
We watch her, dumbstruck...%K%P

0x228
Before long...%K%P

0x234
Yuka「Huh? Guys, what's wrong?」%K%P

0x240
... Yuka tilts her head.%K%P

0x268
Okuhiko「S-Sorry... my stomach's not feeling so good...」%K%P

0x274
Wow, that's cheap, Okuhiko!%K%P

0x288
Haruka「I'm... not hungry.」%K%P

0x294
Haruka! Not you too!%K%P

0x2A8
Yuka「Whaaat—!? But I just finished it and everything!」%K%P

0x2B4
Yuka「I remade it countless times, you know!」%K%P

0x2C0
I don't think the quality of food has anything to do with%Nhow many times you remake it...%K%P

0x2CC
Furthermore, if it's true that "this is the result of all my%Ntime and effort for the last hour, including the countless%Ntimes I remade it," then I just can't understand.%K%P

0x2D8
If that's the case, then just what kind of thing was her%Ninitial result? ... Just trying to imagine it makes my hair%Nstand on end.%K%P

0x2E4
Suddenly, as if she's reading my mind, Yuka says this:%K%P

0x2F8
Yuka「Makoto, you're hungry... right?」%K%P

0x304
She makes it sound as if I'm completely obliged to eat%Nthis.%K

0x640
"Y-Yeah..."

0x64C
"N-No..."

0x34C
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x358
I hopelessly nod...%K%P

0x374
Makoto「N-No...」%K%P

0x380
Somehow, I manage to shake my head.%K%P

0x394
Yuka「Whaaat... Makoto... you too?」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3E0
Yuka「Even though I worked so hard...」%K%P

0x3EC
She sadly looks down at her cooking.%K%P

0x3F8
Yuka「I thought that you would at least try some...」%K%P

0x414
I look back to find Haruka and Okuhiko shooting me%Ncriticizing glares..%K%P

0x420
(Hey, no fair... You two have no right to judge me!!!)%K%P

0x434
I look at Yuka, who is still hanging her head, before%Nfocusing on the "Mysterious Object" on the table.%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Ugh...!」%K%P

0x44C
I close my eyes. I try to convince myself that the%Nfood(?) is so delicious that it makes my mouth water just%Nthinking about it.%K%P

0x458
(... All right!)%K%P

0x464
After a brief moment of silence, I steel my resolution.%K%P

0x478
Makoto「Yuka... To be honest, I'm starving. I've decided I will eat%Nthis after all...」%K%P

0x48C
Yuka instantly calms down upon hearing this, wiping%Naway any signs of her previous depression.%K%P

0x498
Her change is so sudden and genuine that I curse%Nmyself for not being able to say "no".%K%P

0x4AC
In the end, let's just say that Yuka's food drove me to%Nhell and back.%K%P

0x4B8
...%K%P

0x4C4
I never did figure out what the recipe of the "Mysterious%NObject" was.%K%P

0x4D0
In all honesty, I'm too terrified to ask.%K%P
