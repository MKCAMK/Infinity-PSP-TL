It's noon.%K%P

0x144
Kurumi and I are alone in Lunabeach.%K%P

0x150
That's right... In the end, Kurumi didn't go to the pool.%K%P

0x15C
I told Izumi-san "I didn't really want to go to the pool%Nanyway," ... In other words, I told her I'd stay behind and%Nnurse Kurumi.%K%P

0x168
(Of course, I already know she's faking her headache...)%K%P

0x17C
Izumi-san hesitated about accepting my proposal for a%Nwhile, but...%K%P

0x188
Izumi「Well, I'll leave Kurumi to you then.」%K%P

0x19C
... Shortly after she said that, everyone left to go to the%Npool...%K%N

0x1A8
...%K%P

0x1D8
Kurumi「Hey? Are... you hungry?」%K%P

0x1E4
Kurumi「Kurumi's starving...」%K%P

0x1F0
Makoto「I haven't had anything to eat all morning.」%K%P

0x204
Kurumi「Well then, shall Kurumi make something?」%K%P

0x210
Makoto「I'd be happy if you did, but... is your headache any%Nbetter?」%K%P

0x21C
I decide to feign ignorance.%K%P

0x230
Kurumi「Yep. It's completely gone♪」%K%P

0x244
Kurumi「... Anyway... what do you want to eat?」%K%P

0x250
I immediately respond.%K%P

0x25C
Makoto「Carbonara!!」%K%P

0x270
Kurumi「All right♪ Leave it to Kurumi♪」%K%P

0x27C
With those words, Kurumi disappears into the kitchen.%K%P

0x310
Kurumi's homemade carbonara tastes even more%Ndelicious than it did last time.%K%N

0x31C
I feel that her carbonara definitely outclasses%NIzumi-san's cooking from yesterday.%K%N

0x328
After we finish eating, we talk about Shigezo Morino and%Nthe rodents.%K%P

0x33C
... Several hours later, Kurumi seems very energetic%Nagain.%K%N

0x348
No, she never had a headache in the first place... She%Nwas just feeling lonely from not being able to go to the%Npool, but I can't feel any of that from her now.%K%N

0x354
Is Kurumi trying to act as cheerful as she can right now?%K%N

0x360
Or maybe she's not lonely at all because I've been by%Nher side the whole time.%K%P

0x374
%N

0x380
(Her scar... I wonder what Kurumi is thinking about right%Nnow?)%K%N%N

0x38C
It goes without saying that there's no way I can just%Nbring it up...%K%N

0x398
Not until Kurumi wants to bring it up herself... Until that time%Ncomes, I'll just continue to wait patiently.%K%P

0x3A4
Then, during that beautiful starry night on Lunabeach's%Nrooftop, Kurumi will quietly begin to talk about it...%K%P

0x428
Having completed phase one of my plan, I find that we%Nstill have plenty of time to spare.%K%P

0x434
Just then, I am struck with a good idea...%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Hey, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x454
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「Do you believe in the power of premonitions?」%K%P

0x46C
Kurumi「The power of premonitions? By the 'power of%Npremonitions'... are you talking about precognition?」%K%P

0x478
Precog what...? What's that?%K%P

0x484
Makoto「Well, anyway, I'm talking about the special ability to%Nperceive specific events in the future before they%Noccur.」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「Kurumi, do you believe that such a special ability exists?」%K%P

0x4A4
Kurumi「Kurumi thinks it would be cool if it did〜」%K%P

0x4B0
Kurumi「But... why are you asking?」%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「Heh heh heh heh heh...」%K%P

0x4D0
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x4DC
Makoto「The truth is, I have that power myself...」%K%P

0x4F0
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「I guess just saying that isn't enough for you to believe%Nme, huh?」%K%P

0x508
Kurumi「Mmm...」%K%P

0x514
Makoto「All right then. Why don't I just prove it to you...?」%K%P

0x520
Kurumi「Are you going to accurately guess something that's%Ngoing to happen in the future?」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「That's right.」%K%P

0x540
Kurumi「You're lying! That kinda thing's impossible for you〜!」%K%P

0x54C
All right... Everything's going exactly as planned...%K%P

0x558
Makoto「Then how about we make a bet?」%K%P

0x564
Kurumi「A bet?」%K%P

0x570
Makoto「Yeah. If my predictions are correct, there's something I%Nwant you to do for me.」%K%P

0x584
Kurumi「???」%K%P

0x590
Kurumi tilts her head, and I explain the details of the bet%Nand the events that will happen in the near future.%K%P

0x59C
Here's my prediction...%K%P

0x5A8
"When Yuka returns to Lunabeach, she'll definitely be%Ndrunk."%K%P

0x5B4
"And then Yuka will point to a mug in your hand, and make%Na dumb joke that ends with the phrase 'Kurumilk'."%K%P

0x5C0
"After that, Yuka will say 'I want to eat fresh toro.'"%K%P

0x5CC
... I tell her those three events.%K%P

0x5D8
The bet itself is simple.%K%P

0x5E4
"If I'm right, then when Yuka talks about 'toro', you must%Nnot say 'let's go fishing!'"%K%P

0x5F0
And Kurumi...%K%P

0x604
Kurumi「All right, got it♪ You're on♪」%K%P

0x610
... cheerfully consents.%K%P

0x61C
If everything goes according to the plan, then none of%Nus will go fishing today.%K%P

0x628
And if we don't go fishing... that's right... the incident%Nwhere Saki gets swallowed up by that wave won't happen%K%P

0x634
—But will my plan succeed???%K%P
