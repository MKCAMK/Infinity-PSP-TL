When I come to, I am lying on top of one of the tables in%NLunabeach for some reason.%K%P

0x4C
Did I start sleepwalking when I wasn't paying attention...?%K%N

0x58
No, I was probably just distracted with something else...%K%P

0x64
... Another strange thing happened too. ... Yuka's%Ncompletely back to normal.%K%P

0x70
She's acting as if what happened earlier never%Noccurred.%K%P

0x7C
...%K%P

0x88
Once the others see that I'm awake, we begin the next%Nstrategy meeting.%K%P

0xA4
We decide to let time flow normally by letting tomorrow be%N"April 4th".%K%P

0xD4
Izumi「... Agreed? We can continue tricking Okuhiko until%Ntomorrow night, but I think we should end it there.」%K%P

0xE0
As expected, she's probably feeling guilty about%Ncontinuing to deceive Okuhiko.%K%P

0xEC
The others and I feel the same way.%K%P

0xF8
Everyone accepts Izumi-san's proposal.%K%P

0x10C
When she sees that, Izumi-san smiles.%K%P

0x120
Izumi「There are two points of concern for tomorrow.」%K%P

0x12C
Once again, Izumi-san's face turns serious.%K%P

0x138
The first point is that there will be no earthquake%Ntomorrow during the daytime.%K%P

0x144
Izumi「But we can't do anything about that.」%K%P

0x150
Makoto「Well, we'd be really lucky if one happened by chance%Ntomorrow...」%K%P

0x15C
The second thing is about Kurumi's disappearance.%K%P

0x168
Izumi「Without Kurumi present... all we can do is to decide not to%Nhave it take place.」%K%P

0x174
Makoto「You're right...」%K%P

0x180
Yuka and Saki also have resigned expressions.%K%N

0x18C
But...%K%P

0x1E0
Haruka「Wait a minute...」%K%P

0x1EC
... Haruka steps in.%K%P

0x1F8
Haruka「I'll... go missing.」%K%P

0x20C
Izumi「Huh? You will, Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0x218
Makoto「H-Haruka... you...」%K%P

0x224
Haruka「If that happens... then I think Okuhiko will desperately go%Nsearching for me.」%K%P

0x230
No one objects.%K%P

0x23C
In the end, it's decided that Haruka will disappear in%NKurumi's place.%K%P

0x26C
Before long, the meeting ends, and everyone quietly%Nstands up.%K%P

0x278
Everyone looks reluctant to part...%K%P

0x284
When I see that, I understand.%K%P

0x290
Why has it been that up until now, everyone's been%Nserious about deceiving Okuhiko?%K%P

0x2B8
(None of us... want to part.)%K%P

0x2C4
("I want this fun story to continue forever,"... That's what%Nwe're all wishing.)%K%P

0x2D0
I feel the same as the others.%K%P

0x2DC
Originally, the Camp was already supposed to be over,%Nand we were supposed to have returned to our normal%Nlives by now.%K%P

0x2E8
But we all wanted to find a way to forcefully extend it so%Nthat we could continue remaining here.%K%P

0x2F4
"Deceiving Okuhiko." —The only reason we're doing%Nthat is to stay here...%K%P

0x300
And tomorrow, that all ends.%K%P

0x328
(Izumi-san...!)%K%P

0x350
I yearn for Izumi-san again.%K%P

0x35C
This will end tomorrow, but when I think about how I'll have%Nto leave the day after that, I can't help but feel rushed.%K%P

0x368
—There's no more time!%K%N

0x374
I still haven't told Izumi-san how I feel!%K%P

0x380
Makoto「Izumi-san... Is it okay if I stay over here tonight?」%K%P

0x394
Izumi「What?」%K%P

0x3BC
Saki「!?」%K%P

0x3D0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x3F8
Yuka「Wh-What are you saying, Makoto?」%K%P

0x404
Makoto「I'm... so sleepy... I don't want to go back to the lodge.」%K%P

0x42C
Izumi「B-But...」%K%P

0x438
Izumi-san is glancing at the second floor for some%Nreason.%K%P

0x444
Is she worried about whether or not I'll have a place to%Nsleep?%K%N

0x450
Or could it be...?%K%P

0x45C
(It's all right, Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x468
(It's not like I said I wanted to sleep here because I'd%Nplanned on doing THAT.)%K%P

0x474
(All I want to do is tell her...)%K%P

0x480
(How I feel...)%K%P

0x48C
(That's why... I want to go to that place together... with%Nher!)%K%P

0x498
I approach the nervous Izumi-san.%K%P

0x4EC
However, just before I can reach her, Yuka stops me.%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「O-OWWWWW...!!」%K%P

0x504
Yuka pulls on my ear with all her might.%K%P

0x518
Yuka「There's no way in hell that I'm letting you do that!」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「B... But...」%K%P

0x530
Yuka「As the leader, I will not allow any more selfish,%Nindependent actions of this kind!」%K%P

0x578
Yuka then leaves Lunabeach, dragging me by the ear%Nbehind her.%K%P

0x58C
Izumi-san sees me off with an anxious look.%K%P

0x598
It's all right... there's still tomorrow!%K%P

0x5A4
Tomorrow, I'll definitely settle this!%K%P

0x5B0
(Wait until then... Izumi-san...)%K%P
