I can't sleep.%K%P

0x124
I've already trashed around in my bed many times.%K%P

0x130
I glance at the watch wrapped around my wrist.%K%P

0x13C
"5 FRI 2:20 A.M."%K%P

0x148
I definitely won't forget what happened on this day, this%Nvery night in the last loop.%K%P

0x154
Going to Viewpoint Park in the dead of night...%K%N

0x160
The starry sky...%K%N

0x16C
And Izumi-san's... confession...%K%P

0x178
But today, Izumi-san made no such plans with me.%K%P

0x184
I thought she would try to, so I waited, but nothing ever%Ncame of it.%K%P

0x190
Izumi-san is probably fast asleep right now...%K%P

0x1A4
Izumi「... Makoto... kun...」%K%P

0x1B0
Izumi「I wanted...」%K%P

0x1BC
Izumi「... to see...」%K%P

0x1C8
Izumi「the stars with you...」%K%P

0x1D4
Izumi「... just one more time...」%K%P

0x1E8
Izumi-san's... dying words...%K%P

0x1F4
The pain I felt back then cuts into my chest.%K%P

0x200
Pangs of that sorrow and rage reemerge so intensely%Nthat I can't stand staying still.%K%P

0x20C
(—I've got to go!)%K%P

0x218
(—I have to go be by Izumi-san's side!)%K%P

0x224
Resolved, I stand up.%K%P

0x25C
Of course, there's no one in the living room.%K%P

0x268
The only sound I can hear is Okuhiko snoring from up in%Nthe loft.%K%P

0x274
Okuhiko「Hey! Wait!」%K%P

0x280
Okuhiko suddenly shouts in a roaring voice.%K%P

0x28C
When I look up in surprise...%K%P

0x298
Okuhiko「This is bad... I... don't have... enough... energy...」%K%P

0x2A4
Okuhiko「'And so, his partner, Lady Jenny arrives!'」%K%P

0x2B0
Okuhiko「Okkuman♪ I've brought you your NT Drink♪ Drink up♪」%K%P

0x2BC
Okuhiko「Gulp, gulp, gulp...」%K%P

0x2C8
Okuhiko「Xie xie, Lady Jenny! With this, I'll be all right now!」%K%P

0x2D4
Okuhiko「Hang in there, Okkuman♪」%K

0x1768
Continue to listen.

0x1774
Silently leave.

0x314
Okuhiko「All right, here I go!」%K%P

0x320
Okuhiko「Neutrino Energy, Power On! Trans〜form! There!」%K%P

0x32C
Okuhiko「Beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop, swish%Nswish swish swish swish♪ Vroom♪」%K%P

0x338
Okuhiko「Ready!」%K%P

0x344
Okuhiko「The always invigorated youth, the gallant man with a%Ntender heart.」%K%P

0x350
Okuhiko「The warrior of justice sent by God himself for the sake%Nof protecting the Earth...」%K%P

0x35C
Okuhiko「His name is—'Artificial Human Okkuman'!」%K%P

0x368
Okuhiko「Shalom!」%K%P

0x374
Okuhiko「You've shown yourself, Mysterious Hi-Tech Washing%NMachine Man...」%K%P

0x380
Okuhiko「Ugh... my eyes... are spinning...」%K%P

0x38C
Okuhiko「'—Look out! —Okkuman!'」%K%P

0x398
Okuhiko「'—Good luck! —Okkuman!'」%K%P

0x3A4
Okuhiko「'—Don't lose! —Our Hero, Okkuman!'」%K%P

0x3B0
Okuhiko「Ten thousand to the second power♪ He is Okkuman♪」%K%P

0x3BC
Okuhiko「Times one hundred... over a million♪ It's Okkuman♪ ...%NOkkuman!」%K%P

0x3C8
Okuhiko「Zzzzzzzzzz...」%K%P

0x3D4
... It seems he's just sleeptalking.%K%P

0x3E0
Filled with bottomless dread, I quickly leave, as if I'm%Nrunning away.%K%P

0x3F4
(I don't need to listen to this...)%K%P

0x400
Ignoring Okuhiko's sleeptalk, I open the front door.%K%P

0x438
... ... ...%K%P

0x4A4
I walk along the coastline road towards Lunabeach.%K%P

0x4B0
The serene night sky is covered with countless stars...%K%P

0x4BC
Their light, which shines down on the blue Earth, is full of%Nan overwhelming spacious and active feeling.%K%P

0x4C8
Their radiance feels like it's piercing my eyes.%K%P

0x4D4
(I want to see this starry sky... once more...)%K%P

0x4E0
(Once more... with Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x4EC
It's true that I saw these stars last night.%K%P

0x4F8
But it didn't have the feeling it had on "that" night... and%Nbesides...%K%P

0x504
I have to tell Izumi-san something important tonight.%K%P

0x510
—My answer.%K%P

0x51C
I still haven't given Izumi-san a clear answer about her%Nfeelings towards me.%K%P

0x528
I want to properly convey my feelings to her.%K%P

0x534
That's why I'm going...%K%P

0x540
To where Izumi-san is...%K%P

0x54C
In order to look at this starry sky one more time...%K%P

0x5B8
When I arrive at the shop, I immediately try knocking on%Nthe front door.%K%P

0x5D0
...%K%P

0x5DC
There's no response.%K%P

0x5E8
Well, obviously not.%K%P

0x5F4
I doubt that Izumi-san would notice a small knock when%Nshe's sleeping on the second floor.%K%P

0x600
Nevertheless, if I knock on the door too loudly, I might%Nalso wake Kurumi.%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x628
I think about what to do.%K%P

0x634
Just then...%K%P

0x640
—Step... step... step... step...%K%P

0x64C
I can hear the sound of footsteps on sand coming from%Nsomewhere.%K%P

0x658
It's a barely perceptible sound... Is it coming from Moon%NBeach?%K%P

0x664
I cautiously walk around to the backside of the shop.%K%P

0x69C
I stand in the center of the beach, and turn my head%Nfrom the south to the north in order to scan the entire%Nbeach.%K%P

0x6A8
(Izumi-san...!?)%K%P

0x6B4
The pale moonlight shines on her back.%K%P

0x6C0
Izumi-san is on the beach, slowly walking north.%K%P

0x6CC
She's close enough that if I shouted, she'd probably%Nnotice it.%K%P

0x6D8
But... there's Kurumi to consider.%K%P

0x6E4
There's no way I can just call out to her right now.%K%P

0x6F0
(Nevertheless...)%K%P

0x6FC
(Just where does Izumi-san plan on going in the middle%Nof the night?)%K%P

0x708
As if she's inviting me to go with her, I totter after%NIzumi-san...%K%P

0x758
At the end of Moon Beach... I slip through a space%Nbetween some hedges...%K%P

0x790
—That's right. I'm at Tsukiya Hotel.%K%P

0x79C
Izumi-san is sitting by the poolside, dipping her bare%Nfeet in the water.%K%P

0x7A8
(Huh? It feels like I've seen this scene somewhere%Nbefore...)%K%P

0x7B4
(... Right, it was Haruka...)%K%P

0x7C0
On the night of the 1st in the last loop, when we snuck in%Nhere, Haruka did the same thing with her feet.%K%P

0x7CC
(Izumi-san and Haruka...)%K%P

0x7D8
(They really are sisters...)%K%P

0x7E4
I quietly walk over to Izumi-san.%K%P

0x7F0
Izumi-san doesn't notice me as I get closer; all she does%Nis vacantly stare at the pale-blue water.%K%P

0x7FC
Izumi「This feels good.」%K%P

0x808
Her sudden words startle me slightly.%K%P

0x814
Makoto「Oh, so you noticed me... I followed you here.」%K%P

0x820
Izumi-san slowly looks up at my face...%K%P

0x834
Izumi「I see...」%K%P

0x840
... and mutters this in a faint voice.%K%P

0x84C
Izumi「Want to give it a try as well?」%K%P

0x858
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x864
Izumi「After all... the water feels good...」%K%P

0x870
Izumi-san's gaze return to her tiptoes, which she lightly%Nwaves around.%K%P

0x87C
Her toes make small ripples that spread with a clear%Nsound.%K%P

0x888
I sit down next to Izumi-san, and take my shoes and%Nsocks off.%K%P

0x894
—Splash.%K%P

0x8A0
When I sink my feet into the water, a cool, comfortable%Nsensation spreads through me.%K%P

0x8AC
My body temperature slightly lowers from the cool water...%K%P

0x8B8
What Izumi-san said was certainly right.%K%P

0x8C4
Izumi「Well? Doesn't it feel good?」%K%P

0x8D0
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x8E4
When I nod, Izumi-san replies with a happy smile.%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「... Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x904
Izumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0x910
Makoto「Why did you come here...?」%K%P

0x91C
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x928
Izumi「Why indeed...?」%K%P

0x934
Izumi「I couldn't sleep...」%K%P

0x940
Izumi「So I took a walk on the beach, then I remembered this%Npool.」%K%P

0x94C
Izumi「That's all...」%K%P

0x958
Makoto「But... didn't you dislike this sort of thing...?」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「On the last 1st... weren't you opposed to sneaking in%Nhere?」%K%P

0x978
Izumi「Really? When you think of it that way, it is rather strange.」%K%P

0x984
Izumi「I think it's probably that something within me changed%Nbecause of all these successive experiences I've%Nbeen through.」%K%P

0x990
Izumi「In that sense, it might be good that I've turned upon that.」%K%P

0x99C
Izumi「It means I'm not scared of things that once scared me...」%K%P

0x9A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9CC
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0x9D8
Izumi「Perhaps... on the other hand...」%K%P

0x9E4
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xA0C
Izumi「It could be that I'm this calm because I'm touching the%Nwater...」%K%P

0xA18
Izumi「The water's warmth is also warming up my heart...」%K%P

0xA24
Izumi「Gently... and softly...」%K%P

0xA30
Each time Izumi-san waves her feet, new ripples spread%Nacross the water.%K%P

0xA3C
The pale lights coming from the bottom of the pool%Nilluminate Izumi-san's face as they sway.%K%P

0xA48
Izumi「This pool...」%K%P

0xA54
Izumi「It's a bit trifling, but the truth is, this is a memorable place%Nto me...」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「A memorable place?」%K%P

0xA6C
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xA78
Izumi「The first time I came to this island was when I was in%Nmiddle school.」%K%P

0xA84
Izumi「I had learned the secret behind Kurumi's birth from my%Nparents... so I came to this island by myself.」%K%P

0xA90
Izumi「I thought that if I came here, I might be able to find some%Nclues...」%K%P

0xAA4
Izumi「No matter what, I couldn't bear just standing around and%Ndoing nothing.」%K%P

0xAB0
Izumi「I wasn't able to swallow the story that my parents had%Ntold me...」%K%P

0xABC
That's natural...%K%P

0xAC8
If I'd been in Izumi-san's position, I think I would have%Ndone the same thing.%K%P

0xAD4
That three year blank... Kurumi not aging at all... The Shiki%Nno Mori Shrine...%K%P

0xAE0
It would be completely natural to think, "By coming to this%Nisland, I might find the key to solving these mysteries."%K%P

0xAEC
Izumi「I asked the people on the island, and went to the town%Nhall to examine documents...」%K%P

0xAF8
Izumi「But in the end... I found nothing...」%K%P

0xB04
Izumi「The only clue I could claim to have found were the%Nstrange legends about the shrine...」%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB24
Izumi「Ever since then, I've visited this island countless times.」%K%P

0xB30
Izumi「I picked my college because I knew that 'they had one of%Ntheir Seminar Camps here'.」%K%P

0xB3C
Izumi「That's also why I know so much about the island...」%K%P

0xB48
Makoto「And that's how you reached the point where you got to%Nworking at Lunabeach...?」%K%P

0xB54
Izumi「Yes. It was just recently.」%K%P

0xB60
Izumi「I became acquaintances with the shop's owner while I%Nwas in high school... I came back so many times after%Nmeeting him that we became good friends...」%K%P

0xB6C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB78
Izumi「It was around this February that it happened.」%K%P

0xB84
Izumi「After I decided on the schedule for the Seminar Lodge, I%Ncalled the owner.」%K%P

0xB90
Izumi「I told him that I was coming back again at the beginning%Nof April...」%K%P

0xB9C
Izumi「And the manager said...」%K%P

0xBA8
"Ah〜. Actually, that's exactly the time I'm goin' to%NItaly〜."%K%P

0xBB4
Izumi「The instant I heard that, it hit me...」%K%P

0xBC0
Izumi「The plan for that experiment...」%K%P

0xBCC
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0xBD8
Makoto「If possible, it would be best for the observer of the%Nexperiment to be an outsider.」%K%P

0xBE4
Makoto「At the very least, in order to make the test subject not%Nrealize that there was an experiment being conducted...」%K%P「It would be favorable for you to pretend to be an outsider%Nwho had absolutely no connection to our college.」%K%P

0xBF0
Makoto「And that's why you decided to become a part-time%Nemployee at Lunabeach... Did I get that right...?」%K%P

0xBFC
Izumi-san gives a small nod while staring at the wavering%Nlights in the pool.%K%P

0xC08
Makoto「And I was picked as the test subject for a similar%Nreason, wasn't I...?」%K%P

0xC14
Makoto「I was the only member of the group who wasn't%Nacquainted with you.」%K%P

0xC20
Makoto「The only student who barely went to school and never%Nshowed up at the Seminar Camp information session was%N'Makoto Ishihara'.」%K%P

0xC2C
Makoto「I was chosen as the test subject because I was the%None who was the most suitable for that role based on%Nyour criteria...」%K%P

0xC40
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xC4C
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0xC58
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xC64
Izumi「So you're still... mad?」%K%P

0xC70
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xC7C
Izumi「About the experiment...」%K

0x1780
I'm still mad.

0x178C
I'm not mad.

0xCBC
Makoto「Well... yeah, a little...」%K%P

0xCC8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xCD4
Makoto「But with things turning out this way... rather than making%Nme angry, the correct term would be 'drove me nuts'!」%K%P

0xCE0
Makoto「Think about it, after all...」%K%P

0xCEC
Makoto「In the first place, the origin of this incident...」%K%P

0xCF8
... the cause of me getting caught up in this infinite loop%Nwas due to an Izumi-san from another history, the one%Nwho started this experiment...%K%P

0xD04
—What!?%K%P

0xD10
Isn't that wrong!? What the hell am I saying!?%K%P

0xD1C
If we were to assume "this reality is a delusion", and that%N"the time travel is real", then this Izumi-san really hasn't%Ndeceived me once...%K%P

0xD28
I'm really am nuts, aren't I!?%K%P

0xD34
There's nothing to get mad at, is there!?%K%P

0xD40
Izumi「I'm so sorry...」%K%P

0xD4C
Izumi「I'm so... sorry...」%K%P

0xD58
Makoto「No, don't be.」%K%P

0xD6C
Izumi「But you know? I wanted to know no matter what...」%K%P

0xD78
Izumi「About The Third Trait of Curé Syndrome...」%K%P

0xD84
Izumi「To see whether it was true or not...」%K%P

0xD90
Makoto「... What?」%K%P

0xD9C
Makoto「But Izumi-san, you said it was a 'counter-experiment'%Nlast night, didn't you?」%K%P

0xDA8
Izumi「That's what I thought... as a psychologist...」%K%P

0xDC4
Makoto「Of course not... I'm not mad.」%K%P

0xDD0
Makoto「That's not what I was trying to say at all.」%K%P

0xDDC
Makoto「I just wanted to know the simple truth...」%K%P

0xDE8
Izumi「Thank you...」%K%P

0xDFC
Izumi「Makoto-kun... you're kind.」%K%P

0xE08
Izumi「... You're too kind... Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0xE14
My chest feels kinda hot.%K%P

0xE20
I'm embarrassed... but also happy...%K%P

0xE2C
Makoto「Izumi-san? Now that I think about it, there's something%NI've been meaning to ask you...」%K%P

0xE38
While saying this, I avert my gaze so that she doesn't%Nrealize how flustered I am.%K%P

0xE44
Makoto「The Curé Syndrome experiment...」%K%P

0xE50
Makoto「It must have been planned for a specific reason...」%K%P

0xE5C
Makoto「Last night, you said it was a 'counter-experiment'...」%K%P

0xE70
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xE7C
Izumi「But that... was based on my thinking as a psychologist.」%K%P

0xE90
Izumi「As a human... as Kurumi's older sister...」%K%P

0xE9C
Izumi「... I wished for the experiment...」%K%P

0xEA8
Izumi「... to succeed...」%K%P

0xEB4
Izumi「Yesterday, I described The Third Trait as being 'dubious'.」%K%P

0xEC0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xECC
Izumi「But ironically...」%K%P

0xED8
Izumi「The two of 'me' within myself... Right now, their viewpoints%Nare the complete opposite of each other.」%K%P

0xEE4
Makoto「The you as a scholar believes in The Third Trait. But the%Nreal you doesn't believe in it, right?」%K%P

0xEF8
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xF04
Makoto「No, wait a minute.」%K%P

0xF10
Makoto「To go back earlier in the conversation... you just said...%Nthe 'you as Kurumi's sister', right?」%K%P

0xF1C
Makoto「As Kurumi's sister, you wished for the experiment to%Nsucceed...」%K%P

0xF28
Izumi「That's right...」%K%P

0xF34
Izumi「'A firm thought can produce a new reality.'」%K%P

0xF40
Izumi「'If it's really possible, then it can even erase that three%Nyear blank from history, can't it?'... That's what I thought.」%K%P

0xF4C
Izumi「That was the trigger for my interest in Curé Syndrome.」%K%P

0xF58
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xF6C
Izumi「But now... it doesn't matter anymore...」%K%P

0xF78
Izumi「Curé Syndrome and the missing three years... They%Nhave already passed away from my mind...」%K%P

0xF84
Izumi「I've... already resolved myself...」%K%P

0xF98
Izumi「It's thanks to what you told me.」%K%P

0xFA4
Izumi「Your words from back then have solved the worries%Nwithin my mind.」%K%P

0xFB0
Makoto「My words?」%K%P

0xFBC
(The words I said this afternoon?)%K%P

0xFD8
"Tell them everything!"%K%P

0xFE4
(Then Izumi-san's decided to reveal everything after%Nall...)%K%P

0xFF8
"It'd be best to keep everything locked up in your mind."%K%P

0x1004
(In other words, Izumi-san's fortified her resolve to%Ncontinue hiding everything...)%K%P

0x1028
Izumi-san doesn't answer.%K%P

0x1034
She doesn't even show any signs of answering...%K%P

0x1048
—Just then, she sinks into the water.%K%P

0x1054
Though it was sudden, I'm surprisingly not alarmed.%K%P

0x1060
Izumi-san's body sinks underwater as if it's being%Nsucked in...%K%P

0x106C
Though her actions had been spontaneous, they felt%Ncompletely natural for her to do.%K%P

0x1078
Before long...%K%P

0x1090
Izumi-san rises to the surface without even spraying a%Nsingle drop water.%K%P

0x109C
She's in the center of the pool... lightly floating face up%Non the water's surface.%K%P

0x10A8
The clear, transparent blue lights illuminate Izumi-san's%Nentire body.%K%P

0x10B4
It looks as if her body is enveloped in a divine light.%K%P

0x10C0
—A goddess floating on light.%K%P

0x10CC
It's like light is pouring out from Heaven to the physical%Nworld...%K%P

0x10D8
I'm absolutely dumbfounded.%K%P

0x10E4
I'm at a loss for words to even attempt describing this%Nincredible beauty.%K%P

0x1100
Izumi「A memorable place...」%K%P

0x110C
Izumi「I said that earlier, didn't I?」%K%P

0x1118
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1124
Izumi「When I first came to this island, this was the only thing%Nthat granted me peace.」%K%P

0x1130
Izumi「I would walk all over the island until I became totally%Nexhausted... and would be depressed that I had made%Nno progress in the end...」%K%P

0x113C
Izumi「At times like that, I'd always come to this pool, and float in%Nthis pool like this, calmly and leisurely.」%K%P

0x1148
Izumi「Like a jellyfish...」%K%P

0x1154
Izumi「Just by doing that, I could forget everything...」%K%P

0x1160
Izumi「It's so warm and gentle... Being like this makes me feel like%NI'm dissolving in the water...」%K%P

0x116C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x11A4
Izumi「Because the moon was all alone, it was lonely, and would%Ncry during the night.」%K%P

0x11B0
Izumi「'Sob, sob... sob, sob...'」%K%P

0x11BC
Izumi「Even so, the moon was still lonely, and so its tears gave%Nbirth to children.」%K%P

0x11C8
Izumi「A lot of children...」%K%P

0x11D4
Izumi「The child of the moon and the sea, the jellyfish...」%K%P

0x11E0
Izumi「That's the story of The Moon and the Jellyfish...」%K%P

0x11EC
Izumi「When I was young, my father would frequently tell me this%Nstory.」%K%P

0x11F8
Izumi「When we took baths together, he would definitely tell me%Nthe story.」%K%P

0x1204
Izumi「The story's actually longer than that... but it's been so%Nlong since I last heard it that I've forgotten most of the%Nother parts...」%K%P

0x1210
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x121C
Izumi「Now that I think about it, he did it at that one time...」%K%P

0x1228

0x13F4
The water feels pleasant...%K%P

0x1400
(Water... water, huh...)%K%P

Haruka, who was running around meaninglessly with%Nawkward steps...%K%P

0x1430
Kurumi, who cried for milk...%K%P

0x143C
The young, praiseworthy Izumi-san, who carefully%Nwatched over those two...%K%P

0x1540
By the goddess floating on light...%K%N

0x154C
That dazzling, divine brilliance...%K%P
