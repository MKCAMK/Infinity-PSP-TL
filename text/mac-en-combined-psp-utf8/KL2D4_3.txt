While helping out, I keep gauging for when the right timing%Nto start talking to Izumi-san.%K%N

0x88
But for some reason, the customers today just keep on%Ncoming, so she doesn't even have a second to spare%Nfor conversation.%K%N

0x94
Since there's nothing I can do about that, I just quietly%Nfocus on my chores...%K%P

0xA0
I finish seven of my eight assignments with two and a%Nhalf hours left to spare.%K%P

0xB4
It's an hour earlier than last time.%K%N

0xC0
It must be because I've done this work once already, so%NI already knew what to do this time around from the%Nget-go.%K%N

0xCC
At exactly the same time I finish that job... the customers%Nstop coming.%K%N%N

0xD8
—The time has finally come!%K%P

0x164
Izumi「Haah... I'm tired.」%K%P

0x170
As she says this, Izumi-san slumps down on one of the%Nchairs on the terrace.%K%P

0x17C
Izumi「Makoto-kun, do you want to rest for a while too?」%K%P

0x188
(If she's offering me that, then it means my work's%Nalready done...)%K%P

0x194
I sit down in front of Izumi-san.%K%P

0x1A8
Izumi「It's been such a long time since we've had such a%Nconstant flow of customers come in and out...」%K%P

0x1B4
Izumi「If I'm this tired, then I don't think I'd ever get adjusted to%Nsuch a hectic business like this...」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi「Ah, Makoto-kun... would you like some tea?」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「Oh... sure.」%K%P

0x1D8
My reply is clumsy, since I'm nervous.%K%P

0x1EC
... Izumi-san gets up...%K%N

0x1F8
... boils some black tea at the counter...%K%N

0x204
... and returns.%K%P

0x218
Izumi「Here you go♪」%K%P

0x224
Makoto「Ah... thank you.」%K%P

0x230
Izumi-san places the teacup in front of me.%K%P

0x23C
(Well then... where should I begin?)%K%P

0x248
I try to remember how the conversation originated in the%Nlast loop.%K%N

0x254
In the first place, how did that conversation begin?%K%P

0x260
Izumi「Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「Yes!?」%K%P

0x278
She speaks up so suddenly that my voice came out%Nslightly hysterical.%K%P

0x284
Izumi「Have you finished the first stage of your work?」%K%P

0x290
Makoto「You say first stage... but all that's left to do is to go%Nshopping for the barbecue.」%K%P

0x29C
Izumi「What!? You've already finished everything else?」%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「W-Well, yeah...」%K%P

0x2B4
Izumi「Hmm... I see... Then I wonder what I should do...」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x2CC
Izumi「If that's all that's left, then I wonder if it's okay if I send%Nyou alone to go and bring everything back...」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x2E4
Izumi「I'm talking about the shopping...」%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「S-Sure... Then once I'm done drinking my tea-」%K%P

0x2FC
Wait, what the hell am I saying!?%K%N

0x308
I need to ask her about that story first, don't I!?%K%P

0x314
Izumi「Oh! Then you'll go and bring it back?」%K%P

0x320
Makoto「Well, actually, I-」%K%P

0x334
Izumi「Thank you♪ You're a real lifesaver〜♪」%K%P

0x340
Makoto「No, I-」%K%P

0x34C
Izumi「Then I'll go and write up a shopping list for you, so could%Nyou wait a bit?」%K%P

0x360
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x36C
... Izumi-san gets up...%K%N

0x378
... takes a sheet of notepad paper and a ballpoint pen...%K%N

0x384
... and returns.%K%P

0x398
Izumi「Thanks for waiting!」%K%P

0x3A4
Izumi「Umm... first is beef... then green peppers and onions... and%Nwe're out of oil too...」%K%P

0x3B0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3C4
Izumi「Oh, right! I completely forgot... Wouldn't want to make%NYuka-chan angry...」%K%P

0x3D8
Izumi「So that's four cases of beer too...」%K%P

0x3E4
Izumi-san scribbles on the notepad paper while%Nmuttering to herself.%K%P

0x3F0
Izumi「After that... you've got to buy some orange juice...」%K%P

0x3FC
Orange juice.%K%N

0x408
Orange juice?%K%N

0x414
Orange juice!?%K%P

0x420
—That's it! That's how it began!%K%N

0x42C
Which means that now that she brought it up... I can turn%Nthis conversation in the direction I want it to!%K%P

0x438
Izumi「Haruka-chan also can't drink alcohol, right?」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「Right...」%K%P

0x450
Izumi「As I thought...」%K%P

0x45C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x468
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x474
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x480
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「Actually, I'm not sure... Maybe Haruka actually does drink...」%K%P

0x498
Izumi「What〜? Is that right...?」%K%P

0x4A4
Izumi「Well, either way, Kurumi can't drink, so even if you buy it,%Nat least the juice won't go to waste.」%K%P

0x4B0
Izumi「After all, high-schoolers can't drink alcohol, even if they%Nwant to.」%K%P

0x4BC
Izumi「I think she'll definitely want to drink...」%K%P

0x4C8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x4D4
This is certainly...%K%P

0x4E0
Izumi「Kurumi's filled with more curiosity than most people, isn't%Nshe?」%K%P

0x4EC
Izumi「It seems that she's really fascinated by things that are%Nforeign and novel to her.」%K%P

0x4F8
Yeah... it's as I thought... this is it...%K%P

0x504
Makoto「Now that you mention it, Kurumi was the one who%Nsuggested the Test of Courage yesterday.」%K%P

0x510
Izumi「It's really quite troublesome... She really loves those%Nkinds of occult-like things.」%K%P

0x51C
Makoto「Hey, Izumi-san? Can I ask you a question?」%K%P

0x528
Izumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x534
Makoto「It's about that shrine...」%K%P

0x548
Izumi-san's expression darkens. It's the same as last%Ntime...%K%P

0x554
Makoto「Two nights ago, Kurumi suggested going on a 'Mystery%NTour.' You got really mad back then, didn't you?」%K%P

0x560
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x56C
Makoto「Why did you get so angry?」%K%P

0x578
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x584
Makoto「Izumi-san... I know the truth about the God of Demons.」%K%P

0x590
I'm telling the truth this time...%K%P

0x59C
Izumi「Huh!? You know...!?」%K%P

0x5A8
Makoto「Yes...」%K%P

0x5B4
Izumi「No way, you know that I made up that story...?」%K%P

0x5C0
Makoto「Yeah, I did...」%K%P

0x5CC
Izumi「Is... that so...」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「But why does it have to be a lie...?」%K%P

0x5E4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5FC
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x608
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x614
Izumi「... I understand... Then I'll tell you and you alone...」%K%P

0x620
Up until now, this conversation has been the same as%Nthe one that day.%K%N

0x62C
This is it.%K%N

0x638
I will finally learn the truth about Kurumi...%K%P

0x6BC
While getting ready to listen to Izumi-san's story, I look%Nout of the shop's door and survey the beach.%K%P

0x6C8
If Kurumi hears this... it'll mean trouble.%K%N

0x6D4
If she hears this... then it's all over...%K%N

0x6E0
I pay close attention to both Izumi-san and the door.%K%P

0x6EC
As I wait in that nervous state, Izumi-san finally begins to%Nspeak, slowly and quietly...%K%P

0x6F8
Izumi「Yes. As you know, Makoto-kun... that story was a lie...」%K%P

0x704
Izumi「But that doesn't mean it's all false.」%K%P

0x710
Izumi「A lot of people really did go missing at that shrine... that%Nat least is an undeniable fact.」%K%P

0x71C
Izumi「But... I thought that that alone was insufficient...」%K%P

0x728
Makoto「You didn't want us to get near the shrine... right? That's%Nwhy you thought you'd make up that story in order to%Nscare us a little...」%K%P

0x734
Makoto「You thought that if we didn't get near the shrine, then%NKurumi wouldn't go there... right?」%K%P

0x740
Izumi「Y-Yes... But... how did you figure that out...?」%K%P

0x74C
Makoto「It was just... intuition. That's all...」%K%P

0x758
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x764
Makoto「But I still haven't heard the most important part yet...」%K%P

0x770
Makoto「Why don't you want Kurumi to get near the shrine? I don't%Nget it!」%K%P

0x77C
Izumi-san strokes her hair, and gives a deep sigh.%K%P

0x788
A strained sigh...%K%P

0x794
I quietly wait until she begins to talk again.%K%P

0x7A0
Izumi「The truth is...」%K%P

0x7AC
Izumi「... Kurumi... might not be my real sister...」%K%P

0x7B8
Although it's something already know... it feels like my%Nheart is bursting open.%K%P

0x7C4
It might be... because I already knew that.%K%P

0x7D0
Izumi「Listen carefully...」%K%P

0x7DC
Izumi「In the past, Kurumi went missing...」%K%P

0x7E8
Izumi「To put it more accurately, she was kidnapped...」%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x800
I unconsciously clench my hands into fists...%K%P

0x844
Izumi「... It was when Kurumi had only just turned one month old...%N21 years ago...」%K%P

0x850
Makoto「What???」%K%P

0x85C
Makoto「W-What are you saying, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x868
Makoto「Right now, Kurumi is 17 years old...and yet you say she%Nwas kidnapped 21 years ago...」%K%P

0x874
Izumi「There's... there's no way that's possible, is there...?"」%K%P

0x880
Izumi「Right. Certainly... that's impossible... That's why... I have no%Nconfidence in this story...」%K%P

0x88C
Izumi「Even though I'm talking about this now, when Kurumi was%Nkidnapped, I was only a year old...」%K%P

0x898
Makoto「It's obvious, but... I don't remember any of this at all...」%K%P

0x8A4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x8B0
Izumi「My parents told me this story when I was in middle%Nschool...」%K%P

0x8BC
Izumi「Of course, I'm not just going by my parents' words alone.」%K%P

0x8C8
Izumi「I went to the library, thoroughly investigated the%Nnewspapers published at that time, and found that it%Nwas mentioned in one of them...」%K%P

0x8D4
Makoto「That's how I know it's the truth... But on the other hand, I%Ndon't know if any of it was covered up or not...」%K%P

0x8E0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x8EC
Izumi「A bounty for the kidnapper was quickly placed.」%K%P

0x8F8
Izumi「The police tirelessly searched for Kurumi, and the media%Nextensively reported on it, but... In the end, they couldn't%Nfind her...」%K%P

0x904
Izumi「No. To put it accurately, they couldn't find her 'for the%Nnext three years'.」%K%P

0x910
Makoto「In short, three years after the kidnapping, Kurumi was%Nfound alive, and was taken into care by my family...」%K%P

0x91C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「However, at the same time, there was this one perplexing%Nfact that didn't quite make any sense...」%K%P

0x934
Izumi「A perplexing fact?」%K%P

0x940
Izumi「Yes... Kurumi... looked exactly the same as she did during%Nthe time she was kidnapped...」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「She hadn't aged in the slightest... Though the kidnapping%Nhad been three years prior, she was still an infant.」%K%P

0x958
Izumi「That's... impossible...」%K%P

0x964
Izumi「Right. Everyone thought the same thing you did...」%K%P

0x970
Izumi「The police also thought it was suspicious, so they even%Nhad a DNA test taken...」%K%P

0x97C
Makoto「When the results came in... it declared that the possibility%Nof the baby being Kurumi was 99.99999％.」%K%P

0x988
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x994
Makoto「However... Makoto-kun, did you know this? Me and%NKurumi's father is a genetic engineering expert...」%K%P

0x9A0
Yes... I heard about it from Kurumi. Your father, Dr. Morino,%Nis also the world famous authority on the subject...%K%P

0x9AC
Makoto「—And just then, it hits me!」%K%P

0x9B8
Izumi「D-Don't tell me... Are you saying that Dr. Morino falsified%Nthe results of the DNA test!?」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「... I can't say for certain... that the possibility doesn't%Nexist...」%K%P

0x9D0
Makoto「But there's no way that Dr. Morino performed the test%Nhimself, right!?」%K%P

0x9DC
Izumi「Because his interests would have easily influenced him,%Nthe legal DNA test would have been conducted by some%Nother, neutral researcher!」%K%P

0x9E8
Izumi「Yes. You're certainly right.」%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「But my father has a lot of influence, so it would have%Nbeen easy for him to put some kind of pressure on the%Nresearcher who conducted the legal DNA test...」%K%P

0xA00
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「'If it meant getting my beloved daughter back, I would%Nuse whatever means necessary...' That's the kind of%Nperson my father is...」%K%P

0xA18
Izumi「Even if it was a completely different baby... he would%Npretend that it was his real daughter... That's how he%Nhandled it...」%K%P

0xA24
Izumi「... Either way, this isn't something I can declare with%Ncomplete confidence...」%K%P

0xA30
Were those test results the truth..? Or were they the%Nresult of my father's secret influence...?%K%P

0xA3C
... With this, I now understand that this is the reason why%NIzumi-san thinks Kurumi might not be her real sister.%K%P

0xA48
Still, the real problem isn't Dr. Morino's involvement, but%Nrather the fact that Kurumi didn't age at all in three years.%K%P

0xA54
For argument's sake, let's say that Kurumi had aged%Nthree years when she was found. Then Izumi-san and%Neveryone else wouldn't have had any doubts to begin%Nwith.%K%P

0xA60
—A three year blank.%K%P

0xA6C
Izumi「If I can clear up that mystery, then naturally, I'll probably%Nbe able to figure out the truth...」%K%P

0xA78
Makoto「Makoto-kun... But don't misunderstand me, okay?」%K%P

0xA84
Izumi「?」%K%P

0xA90
Izumi「Despite everything I've said, it has never lessened my%Nlove for Kurumi one bit.」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「Even if we're not blood related, Kurumi is my real... little%Nsister.」%K%P

0xAA8
Izumi「I know, Izumi-san...」%K%P

0xAB4
Izumi「The one I'm worried about... has always been Kurumi%Nherself.」%K%P

0xAC0
Izumi「If Kurumi were ever to learn this... If she started pressing%Nme with questions in the future...」%K%P

0xACC
Makoto「Then I wouldn't know... what I should say.」%K%P

0xAD8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xAE4
Izumi「The place that Kurumi was discovered in... 18 years ago...」%K%P

0xAF0
Makoto「Was that 'Shiki no Mori Shrine'...」%K%P

0xAFC
Izumi「!?」%K%P

0xB08
Izumi「That's the reason why I don't want Kurumi approaching%Nthat shrine...」%K%P

0xB14
Because I'm scared that at any moment, the truth will slip%Nout...%K%N

0xB20
...%K%N

0xB2C
The shrine, the kidnapping, and the fact that Kurumi might%Nnot be Izumi-san's real sister.%K%P

0xBB0
Makoto「With this, all the dots... have been connected...」%K%P

0xBBC
Izumi-san...?%K%P

0xBC8
Makoto「At the end, I casually think to ask her one last simple%Nquestion.」%K%P

0xBD4
Izumi「About Kurumi's kidnapper... was he caught in the end?」%K%P

0xBE0
Makoto「Yes... but rather than 'caught', 'found' might be a better%Nword for it...」%K%P

0xBEC
Izumi「?」%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「The kidnapper died, you see...」%K%P

0xC04
Izumi「H-How did he die?」%K%P

0xC10
Makoto「He was pinned under a collapsed building...」%K%P

0xC1C
Izumi「A collapsed... building...?」%K%P

0xC28
Makoto「I don't know if it was some kind of fate, but he was also%Nfound at the 'Shiki no Mori Shrine'... seven days after%NKurumi was kidnapped.」%K%P

0xC34
Izumi「What!?」%K%P

0xC40
Izumi「21 years ago, there were a lot of earthquakes on this%Nisland.」%K%P

0xC4C
Izumi「Those tremors destroyed the shrine...」%K%P

0xC58
Makoto「After the bounty was placed on the kidnapper, he%Nprobably had nowhere to run... so he hid in that shrine...」%K%P

0xC64
Then... was Kurumi also-?%K%P

0xC70
Izumi「Izumi-san slowly shakes her head.」%K%P

0xC7C
Makoto「It seems like they searched every nook and cranny of%Nthe collapsed building, but...」%K%P

0xC88
Izumi「They couldn't find her... Kurumi wasn't there...」%K%P

0xC94
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xCA0
Izumi「Before long, the collapsed shrine was rebuilt...」%K%P

0xCAC
Makoto「Then, three years after the shrine was destroyed—a%Ntourist who was passing by the area by pure chance%Nheard a baby crying inside the shrine...」%K%P

0xCB8
And that's when Kurumi was found.%K%P

0xCC4
—Huh??? Wait...%K%P

0xCD0
The shrine... An earthquake... The destruction of the%Nshrine...%K%P

0xCDC
Not aging for three years...%K%P

0xCE8
Could that have been... —Time travel!?%K%P

0xCF4
In my case, I was sent to the past, but Kurumi was sent%Nthree years into the future...%K%P

0xD00
It's not impossible!%K%P

0xD0C
No, if you thought about it normally, then it would be%Nridiculous to even imagine such an absurd event...%K%P

0xD18
... But I'm really experiencing this strange world.%K%P

0xD24
I'm living proof that the phenomenon known as time travel%Nexists!%K%P

0xD30
Furthermore... Furthermore, if my hypothesis is correct,%Nthen I can also explain Kurumi's scar.%K%P

0xD3C
In other words, it's like this:%K%P

0xD48
Just before the shrine was destroyed, Kurumi was in%Nthere with the kidnapper.%K%P

0xD54
But via some kind of unknown source, "immediately after%Nthe shrine was destroyed", only Kurumi time traveled%Nthree years into the future...%K%P

0xD60
Immediately after it was destroyed... —therefore, she%Ngot injured on her back due to debris that fell during%Nthe destruction of the shrine.%K%P

0xD6C
... If this is right, then this means that I can explain%Neverything!%K%P

0xD78
Makoto「I should ask Izumi-san!」%K%P

0xD84
Izumi「Izumi-san!?」%K%P

0xD90
Makoto「Yes?」%K%P

0xD9C
Izumi「I want you to tell me one thing.」%K%P

0xDA8
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xDB4
Makoto「When Kurumi was found in the shrine...」%K%P

0xDC8
Izumi「Was there... a large wound on her back?」%K%P

0xDD4
Izumi「... What!?」%K%P

0xDE0
H-How did you... know that?%K%P

0xDEC
Izumi「As I thought...」%K%P

0xDF8
Izumi「Th-That's right... It seems she was really bleeding badly...%NThat's why, right after she was found, she was%Nimmediately taken to the clinic...」%K%P

0xE04
Makoto「Hey, how? How did you know...?」%K%P

0xE10
Izumi「Izumi-san... With this, I now understand...」%K%P

0xE1C
Makoto「Huh???」%K%P

0xE28
Makoto「Kurumi is your real sister! You two are true blood related%Nsisters!」%K%P

0xE34
Izumi「I can say with confidence that I'm right!」%K%P

0xE40
Makoto「... What do you mean?」%K%P

0xE4C
Izumi「Well then, I'm going shopping now.」%K%P

0xED0
Huh!? W-Wait a minute, Makoto-kun!!%K%N

0xEDC
I managed to escape, but...%K%P

0xEE8
Would it have been for the best if I had properly%Nexplained it to Izumi-san?%K%N

0xEF4
No... There's no way that she'd believe in the time%Ntraveling...%K%P

0xF00
Besides, no matter what, I'd be unwilling to tell her that%Nsuch a thing happened to Kurumi...%K%P

0xF0C
I head down the road towards the shopping district...%K%P

0xF18
My mind is calm.%K%P

0xF24
It's probably because the uneasiness that's been%Nconsuming my heart has been completely erased.%K%P

0xF30
That's because I've confirmed that Kurumi and Izumi-san%Nare true sisters...%K%P

0xF3C
My legs are moving faster than ever before, as if they%Nwere previously held down by some kind of weight.%K%P

0xFD8
After that...%K%N

0xFE4
We go to the barbecue, and spend several hours just%Ndrinking and creating a large uproar...%K%P

0xFF0
Unfortunately, Yuka got drunk again, but Saki and%NHaruka's fight never occurred this time.%K%P

0xFFC
Thinking about it, it's only natural. In this history, Saki and%NHaruka are getting along just fine.%K%P

0x1008
Of course, Kurumi's disappearance and the uproar that%Nsurrounded it don't happen this time, either.%K%N

0x1014
—But maybe she'll go missing later???%K%N

0x1020
No, that definitely won't happen.%K%P

0x102C
That's because right now, Kurumi is sleeping soundly%Nbefore my eyes.%K%P

0x1038
After the barbecue, we all gathered in the lodge and%Nheld a seven bridge tournament.%K%P

0x1044
It only ended about thirty minutes ago, and when I came%Nto my senses, Kurumi had taken possession of my bed%Nwithout me noticing it.%K%P

0x1050
It's almost the time when I met Kurumi on the roof of%NLunabeach last time and she talked about her "scar".%K%P

0x105C
But I'll just let her sleep like this.%K%P

0x1068
I don't want to hear that infuriating story about that%N"senpai" of hers...%W%W%W%K%P

0x1074
It'll be fine.%K%P

0x1080
I still remember everything she told me that night...%W%W%W%K%P
