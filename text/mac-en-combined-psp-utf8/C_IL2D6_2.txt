0x51C
Makoto「Izumi-san... all this time, I've-」%K%P

0x54C
Just then, all of the sudden....%K%N

0x558

As she says this, Izumi-san pulls back her finger.%K%P

0x618
She slowly turns around, and walks on the beach.%K%P

0x624
She takes off her shoes while walking, and goes%Nbarefoot.%K%P

0x630

0x6C4
Izumi「I found one...」%K%P

0x6D0
Izumi「... A star sand...」%K%P

0x6DC
Looking closely, I see a pure white grain of sand on her%Nwet palm.%K%P

0x6E8
It's in the shape of shining star... It's like Leo...%K%P

0x6F4
Izumi-san closes the hand with the "star sand" in it, and%Nuses her other hand to search through her pocket.%K%P

0x700
The thing she takes out is as big as her thumb...%K%P

0x714
—A small glass bottle.%K%N

0x720
Inside, there are two small stars shining.%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「... Two of them?」%K%P

0x76C
Izumi「Makoto-kun... so you really weren't listening.」%K%P

0x778
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x784
Izumi「This afternoon, Haruka gave one to me...」%K%P

0x790
Izumi「It washed up at the pier in the harbor...」%K%P

0x79C
Izumi「It's just a small grain...」%K%P

0x7A8
Izumi-san takes the cork off the small bottle, and puts%Nthe "star sand" she just picked up into it.%K%P

When I look up, I see rain falling from the sky.%K%P

0x8E0
Izumi「Rain...」%K%P

0x8EC
Izumi-san mutters this, and looks up at the sky.%K%P

0x8F8
The raindrops are small, like powdered snow.%K%P

0x90C
Izumi「Rain, huh...」%K%P

0x918
She softly closes her eyes, and bathes her whole body%Nin the raindrops.%K%P

0x924
The pouring rain makes her body look like it's almost%Nglowing.%K%P

0x930
I've reached my limit.%K%P

0x93C
Seeing her beautiful figure clad in water has made my%Nheart restless.%K%P

0x948
