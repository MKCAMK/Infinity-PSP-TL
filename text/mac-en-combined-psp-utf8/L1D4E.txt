... The barbecue is finally set up.%K%N

0x84
Everyone is holding their own paper cup.%K%N

0x90
Inside them is ice cold beer.%K%P

0x9C
(However, Kurumi and Haruka have orange juice.)%K%P

0xA8
Savory smoke begins to rise from the iron plate.%K%P

0xBC
Izumi「Well then, shall we make a toast?」%K%P

0xC8
Izumi「The one to lead off the toast will be... right. Leader of the%NKawashima Party, would you do the honors?」%K%P

0xE4
Yuka「Huh? Me?」%K%P

0xF0
Everyone's gazes immediately turn to Yuka.%K%P

0x104
Yuka「All right! Leave it to me!」%K%P

0x118
Yuka「... But... what should I toast to?」%K%P

0x124
Kurumi「Geez, you're supposed to think it up yourself, Yuka-san!」%K%P

0x138
Yuka「I see... You're right.」%K%P

0x14C
Yuka「Let's see...」%K%P

0x158
Yuka「All right, then to our chance meeting...」%K%P

0x16C
Yuka「And it's a little late, but also to Saki's recovery...」%K%P

0x178
Yuka「Well then, cheers♪」%K%P

0x184
Everyone「Cheers!」%K%P

0x190
With their voices in unison, everyone touts their paper%Ncups...%K%N

0x19C
... They're all smiling...%K%N

0x1A8
They're... smiling...?%K%P

0x25C
I only realized it just now...%K%P

0x268
I must not have realized it because everyone's acting%Nso naturally.%K%P

0x2AC
Saki and Haruka's happy faces...%K%N

0x2B8
Why do they seem so happy, even though they fought%Nonly yesterday?%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「Kurumi, Kurumi... come here...」%K%P

0x2EC
Kurumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x2F8
When everyone else becomes engrossed in%Nconversation with each other, I pick that time to casually%Ncall Kurumi over towards a nook.%K%P

0x330
Makoto「This may be an abrupt question, but...」%K%P

0x33C
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x348
Makoto「Were Saki and Haruka in this kind of mood before I%Narrived at Lunabeach?」%K%P

0x354
I quickly glance towards the circle of people that has%Nnow formed by the plate.%K%P

0x360
Kurumi「Oh, that's right... Onii-chan, you don't know...」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x378
Kurumi「Yeah. Guess what?」%K%P

0x384
When she says that, Kurumi suddenly begins to whisper.%K%P

0x390
Kurumi「Truth is, it seems Saki-san... had no intention of coming to%NLunabeach.」%K%P

0x39C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x3A8
Kurumi「And then, before you came, Onii-chan... Kurumi thinks it%Nwas just about 4:00.」%K%P

0x3B4
Kurumi「Onee-chan went to Saki-san's summer house, and%Nmanaged to persuade her somehow...」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「So that put Saki back in a good mood...」%K%P

0x3CC
Kurumi「That's right. See, that's Onee-chan's specialty, right?」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「... But is Haruka okay?」%K%P

0x3E4
Kurumi「Yeah. It seems you don't have to worry much about%NHaruka-san.」%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「Then those two have made peace?」%K%P

0x3FC
Kurumi「Hmm... Kurumi wonders about that... Kurumi doesn't think%Nshe would go as far as to say that...」%K%P

0x408
Kurumi「Saki-san does seem to be a little upset...」%K%P

0x414
Makoto「Really?」%K%P

0x420
Kurumi「Ah... it's not like Kurumi can tell if she feels that way or%Nnot...」%K%P

0x42C
Kurumi「It's just what Kurumi... happens to... think...」%K%P

0x438
Makoto「Hmm... I see.」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「Thank you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x450
I pat her on the head.%K%P

0x464
Saki seems happy...%K%N

0x470
She was fighting with Haruka mere hours ago. How's this%Npossible?%K%P

0x498
Makoto「Kurumi, Kurumi... come here...」%K%P

0x4A4
Kurumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x4B0
When everyone else becomes engrossed in%Nconversation with each other, I pick that time to casually%Ncall Kurumi over towards a nook.%K%P

0x4E8
Makoto「This may be an abrupt question, but...」%K%P

0x4F4
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「Was Saki in this kind of mood before Haruka and I arrived%Nat Lunabeach?」%K%P

0x50C
I quickly glance towards Saki.%K%P

0x518
Kurumi「Oh, that's right... Onii-chan, you don't know...」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x530
Kurumi「Yeah. Guess what?」%K%P

0x53C
When she says that, Kurumi suddenly begins to whisper.%K%P

0x548
Kurumi「Truth is, it seems Saki-san... had no intention of coming to%NLunabeach.」%K%P

0x554
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x560
Kurumi「And then, before you came, Onii-chan... Kurumi thinks it%Nwas just about 4:00.」%K%P

0x56C
Kurumi「Onee-chan went to Saki-san's summer house, and%Nmanaged to persuade her somehow...」%K%P

0x578
Makoto「So she brought Saki along...」%K%P

0x584
Kurumi「That's right. See, that's Onee-chan's specialty, right?」%K%P

0x590
Makoto「... Then does that mean that completely put Saki in a%Ngood mood?」%K%P

0x59C
Kurumi「Hmm... Kurumi wonders about that... Kurumi doesn't think%Nshe would go as far as to say that...」%K%P

0x5A8
(Well... that's a given...)%K%P

0x5B4
I don't know how Izumi-san managed to persuade Saki.%NGiven that she quarreled with Haruka today, it would%Nhave taken a miracle to cheer her up so much.%K%P

0x5C0
Kurumi「Ah... it's not like Kurumi can tell if she feels that way or%Nnot...」%K%P

0x5CC
Kurumi「It's just what Kurumi... happens to... think...」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「Hmm... I see.」%K%P

0x5E4
Makoto「Thank you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x5F0
I pat her on the head.%K%P

0x604
Saki and Haruka's happy faces...%K%N

0x610
How are they both so happy when they fought mere%Nhours ago?%K%P

0x638
Makoto「Kurumi, Kurumi... come here...」%K%P

0x644
Kurumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x650
When everyone else becomes engrossed in%Nconversation with each other, I pick that time to casually%Ncall Kurumi over towards a nook.%K%P

0x688
Makoto「This may be an abrupt question, but...」%K%P

0x694
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x6A0
Makoto「Have Saki and Haruka been in this mood since the%Nbeginning?」%K%P

0x6AC
I quickly glance towards the circle of people that has%Nnow formed by the plate.%K%P

0x6B8
Kurumi「Oh, that's right... Onii-chan, you don't know...」%K%P

0x6C4
Makoto「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x6D0
Kurumi「Yeah. Guess what?」%K%P

0x6DC
When she says that, Kurumi suddenly begins to whisper.%K%P

0x6E8
According to her, Saki originally had no intention of%Ncoming to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x6F4
But then Okuhiko managed to calm her down, and%Npersuaded her to come along with him.%K%P

0x700
(Okuhiko actually managed to persuade Saki...)%K%P

0x70C
(Damn, he's good...!)%K%P

0x718
I feel a bit of admiration.%K%P

0x724
Makoto「... But is Haruka okay?」%K%P

0x730
Kurumi「Yeah. It seems you don't have to worry much about%NHaruka-san.」%K%P

0x73C
(Don't worry... about Haruka?)%K%P

0x748
Makoto「Then... are you saying that... those two have made%Npeace?」%K%P

0x754
Kurumi「Hmm... Kurumi wonders about that... Kurumi doesn't think%Nshe would go as far as to say that...」%K%P

0x760
Kurumi「To put it some way or another, at the very least, Saki%Ndoes seem a little bothered by it all after all...」%K%P

0x76C
(Well, that's probably true...)%K%P

0x778
Given that she quarreled with Haruka today at Viewpoint%NPark, it would have taken a miracle to cheer her up so%Nmuch.%K%P

0x784
Kurumi「Ah... it's not like Kurumi can tell if she feels that way or%Nnot...」%K%P

0x790
Kurumi「It's just what Kurumi... happens to... think...」%K%P

0x79C
Makoto「Hmm... I see.」%K%P

0x7A8
Makoto「Thank you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x7B4
I pat her on the head.%K%P

0x7C8
Saki and Haruka's happy faces...%K%N

0x7D4
Why do they seem so happy, even though they fought%Nonly yesterday?%K%P

0x7FC
Makoto「Kurumi, Kurumi... come here...」%K%P

0x808
Kurumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x814
When everyone else becomes engrossed in%Nconversation with each other, I pick that time to casually%Ncall Kurumi over towards a nook.%K%P

0x84C
Makoto「This may be an abrupt question, but...」%K%P

0x858
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x864
Makoto「Have Saki and Haruka been in this mood since the%Nbeginning?」%K%P

0x870
I quickly glance towards the circle of people that has%Nnow formed by the plate.%K%P

0x87C
Kurumi「Oh, that's right... Onii-chan, you don't know...」%K%P

0x888
Makoto「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x894
Kurumi「Yeah. Guess what?」%K%P

But then Okuhiko managed to calm her down, and%Npersuaded her to come along with him.%K%P

0x8C4
(Okuhiko actually managed to persuade Saki...)%K%P

0x8D0
(Damn, he's good...!)%K%P

0x8DC
I feel a bit of admiration.%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「... But is Haruka okay?」%K%P

0x8F4
Kurumi「Yeah. It seems you don't have to worry much about%NHaruka-san.」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「Then those two have made peace?」%K%P

0x90C
Kurumi「Hmm... Kurumi wonders about that... Kurumi doesn't think%Nshe would go as far as to say that...」%K%P

0x918
Kurumi「Saki-san does seem to be a little upset...」%K%P

0x924
Makoto「Really?」%K%P

0x930
Kurumi「Ah... it's not like Kurumi can tell if she feels that way or%Nnot...」%K%P

0x93C
Kurumi「It's just what Kurumi... happens to... think...」%K%P

0x948
Makoto「Hmm... I see.」%K%P

0x954
Makoto「Thank you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x960
I pat her on the head.%K%P

0x9B4
I go back into the circle with everyone.%K%P

0x9C0
Now that Kurumi's mentioned it, it's easy to tell by Saki's%Nexpression that there's definitely something bothering%Nher about this whole situation.%K%P

0x9CC
If Kurumi hadn't told me, I wouldn't have noticed it...%K%P

0x9E4
Just then, Haruka suddenly speaks...%K%P

0xA2C
Haruka「This...」%K%P

0xA38
Haruka dangles a slightly dirty, clear plastic bag in front%Nof her.%K%P

0xA44
Inside is a wriggling group of small, living creatures,%Nclosely packed and jammed in the bag.%K%P

0xA50
Everyone's jaws drop...%K%P

0xA5C
Makoto「Wh-What are those...?」%K%P

0xA68
Resolving myself, I decide to try asking her.%K%P

0xA74
Haruka「Sea roaches.」%K%P

0xA80
Haruka quickly answers.%K%P

0xA8C
Okuhiko「Wh-Wh-Wh-What d-do you intend to do with them,%NHaruka-chan?」%K%P

0xA98
Soon enough, she responds with...%K%P

0xAB4
Haruka「Eat them.」%K%P

0xAC0
Okuhiko「... Huh?」%K%P

0xACC
Yuka「... Huh?」%K%P

0xAD8
Izumi「... Huh?」%K%P

0xAE4
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0xAF0
Makoto「... Huuuh!?」%K%P

0xB0C
Kurumi「... But they might be surprisingly tasty!」%K%P

0xB18
Kurumi mutters this.%K%P

0xB24
Saki「Th-There's no way something like that would be good!」%K%P

0xB40
Haruka「... Shall I try grilling them?」%K%P

0xB54
Saki「Hey, listen to what people are saying, dammit!」%K%P

0xB60
Kurumi「Grill them, grill them, grill the sea roaches♪」%K%P

0xB6C
Saki「Don't grill them!」%K%P

0xB78
Haruka ignores her pleas...%K%P

0xB84
As Saki protests, Haruka has almost finished opening%Nthe plastic bag.%K%P

0xB98
Izumi「Hold on, Haruka-chan..?」%K%P

0xBB4
Yuka「Stop it, Haruka!」%K%P

0xBC0
Yuka reaches her arm out, and tries to snatch the%Nplastic bag out of Haruka's hands.%K%P

0xBCC
And in that instant!%K%P

0xC20
The opening to the plastic bag opens up, and the large%Ngroup of sea roaches scatter.%K%P

0xC34
Okuhiko「GUWAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0xC40
Okuhiko screams in an extremely loud voice.%K%P

0xC54
We all panic, and begin to frantically run away.%K%P

0xC60
We're like spiders running away from a fire.%K%N

0xC6C
Fortunately, none of the sea roaches land on top of the%Niron plate as they scatter away...%K%P

0xC90
... And before long, they've all disappeared in the%Ndirection of the rocks.%K%P

0xCB8
Makoto「Heeey, it's all right now!」%K%P

0xCC4
When they hear my voice, everyone timidly comes back.%K%P

0xCD8
Yuka「Sheesh! Haruka!? Kurumi-chan!?」%K%P

0xCE4
As soon as Yuka comes back, she cries in a thunderous%Nvoice.%K%P

0xD00
Haruka「But...」%K%P

0xD0C
Kurumi「... We wanted to eat them.」%K%P

0xD18
Haruka and Kurumi slump their shoulders in%Ndisappointment...%K%P

0xDBC
About an hour has passed since then.%K%N

0xDC8
I guess you could say the party's in full swing?%K%P

0xDD4
On contrary to what you'd expect, it seems that sea%Nroach incident only caused everyone's hearts to%Nbecome heated up.%K%P

0xDE0
I mean "heated up" in a good way - in other words, it's%Neven livelier than before.%K%P

0xDEC
Everything is calm as we fool around and poke fun at%Neach other.%K%P

0xDF8
No, calling it "calm" is too much of a stretch, as there's%Nstill a noisy clamor about.%K%P

0xE20
Particularly from... Yuka.%K%P

0xE68
Yuka「Phaaa! Beer goshe well wif barbecuesh, doeshen't it?%NRight? Right?」%K%P

0xE74
To her, one short hour must be more than enough time to%Nget plastered.%K%P

0xE80
Yuka「Kurumi-tan, yuu want a drink?」%K%P

0xE8C
As she says this, she takes Kurumi's paper cup filled%Nwith orange juice and tries to pour in beer.%K%P

0xE98
Makoto「Hey, hey, don't encourage minors!」%K%P

0xEAC
Yuka「Sheesh, yer shou shtiff.」%K%P

0xEB8
Yuka「Yuu haven't had enuff to drink yet, have yuu, Mako-tan?」%K%P

0xEC4
This time, she thrusts a beer can towards me.%K%P

0xED0
(Geez, Yuka should be banned from alcohol...)%K%P

0xEDC
(I should've kept a close eye on her...)%K%P

0xEE8
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0xEF4
I release a weary sigh.%K%P

0xF08
Yuka「Ahh, if yer like dat, yer gonna widder away shooooooon.」%K%P

0xF14
Yuka「Yuu'll bee like a shiitake!」%K%P

0xF20
Okuhiko「Dahahahaha♪ Aren't shiitakes nice, Yuka-chan?」%K%P

0xF3C
Thanks to Okuhiko's laugh, I'm kind of pissed off.%K%P

0xF48
In an attempt to sway off my irritation, I reach my%Nchopsticks out for a grilled piece of beef.%K%P

0xF54
But just as I'm on the verge of grabbing it, my hand slips%Naccidentally, and the chopsticks fall on top of the iron%Nplate.%K%P

0xF68
Kurumi「Geez, Onii-chan, you sure you're not drunk?」%K%P

0xF74
Drunk?%K%N

0xF80
... Hmm... that's certainly possible.%K%N

0xF8C
Doing things such as knocking over cups and dropping%Nmy chopsticks are signs that I could be drunk.%K%P

0xF98
(I need to show a little more self-control...)%K%P

0xFA4
While I'm thinking this...%K%N

0xFB0
... I seem to have lost my mind, as I suddenly try to grab%Nmy chopsticks off the iron plate with my bare hands.%K%P

0xFBC
Makoto「HOT!!」%K%P

0xFC8
I frantically jerk my hand away.%K%P

0xFDC
Kurumi「Kyahahaha♪ Geez, you're so helpless... Kurumi will get%Nthem for you♪」%K%P

0xFE8
Kurumi picks up my chopsticks using her own.%K%P

0x1018
Just then...%K%P

0x1034
Yuka「Ahh!!」%K%P

0x1040
... Suddenly, Yuka tries to bend herself forward, and%Npoints at my lightly burnt hand.%K%P

0x104C
She points at me using her middle and index fingers...%K%P

0x1074
Yuka「Eye have jusht come up wif shomefing amashin'!」%K%P

0x1080
Kurumi「... Huh?!」%K%P

0x1094
Yuka「Whaa doo yuu call a burnt Ishihara?」%K%P

0x10A0
Kurumi「... What?」%K%P

0x10AC
Yuka「Ish a joke, a joke!」%K%P

0x10B8
Yuka「Whaa doo yuu call a burnt Ishihara? An 'Ishiitakehara'!」%K%P

0x10C4
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x10D0
Makoto「... Th-That's pretty weak...」%K%P

0x10DC
Kurumi「Hmm... Yuka-san, sorry, but it's not really that funny.」%K%P

0x10F0
Yuka「Huuuuh! Yer kiddin'! Even dough I fought it wash radder%Nclever! Boo...」%K%P

0x10FC
She's booing again...%K%P

0x1108
Well, for the time being, I'm relieved.%K%N

0x1114
If Yuka and Kurumi were in perfect synch, then I'd fear for%Nthe future of this planet.%K%P

0x1120
Yuka「Hmmm〜〜〜〜〜〜〜mmmm.」%K%P

0x1134
Yuka「Den haush dish?」%K%P

0x1140
Yuka's eyes sparkle.%K%P

0x1164
—And at that time!%K%P

0x11A8
This time, Saki's the one who commits a blunder.%K%N

0x11B4
The instant she tries to transfer the paper cup in her%Nright hand to her left hand, her hand slips.%K%P

0x11C0
Her beer splashes all over Yuka, who was standing right%Nnext to her.%K%P

0x11CC
From her chest to her lower sections... almost her entire%Nbody has been soaked by a large amount of beer.%K%P

0x11E0
Yuka「... H-Hey, Shakiiiiii...」%K%P

0x11FC
Saki「... S-Sorry.」%K%P

0x1208
Everyone becomes completely silent.%K%P

0x1214
Okuhiko「But I guess you could say she's 'soaking up the beer',%Nright? That's not much of a difference.」%K%P

0x1220
Okuhiko makes an unnecessary joke.%K%N

0x122C
When Saki hears that...%K%P

0x1240
Saki「Hee hee...」%K%P

0x124C
... She giggles.%K%P

0x1268
Yuka「Geesh, dish ish no laffin' matter!」%K%P

0x1284
Saki「... Really, I'm sorry.」%K%P

0x1290
Saki「It's just what Okuhiko-kun, hee hee, said was... kinda true...」%K%P

0x12C0
—The instant she says this, something comes flying%Nfrom a different direction!%K%P

0x12CC
It's an orange colored liquid... juice.%K%N

0x12D8
That orange juice flies straight as if it were a living%Nbeing, landing a direct hit on Saki.%K%P

0x12EC
We all simultaneously look in the direction of where the%Njuice was thrown...%K%P

0x131C
Standing there is Haruka, holding an empty paper cup.%K%P

0x1338
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1344
Saki seems bewildered, as if she doesn't fully%Nunderstand what just happened.%K%P

0x1360
Haruka「You don't seem... to feel bad about what you did.」%K%P

0x136C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1378
Haruka「I didn't think you'd understand... unless the same thing%Nwas done to you.」%K%P

0x138C
Saki「Wh... Wh... What the hell's your problem!?」%K%P

0x1398
Saki「I did feel bad! That's why I apologized countless times!」%K%P

0x13A4
Haruka「Only apologizing twice... is hardly what you'd call%N'countless'.」%K%P

0x13B0
Saki「Twice is enough for this shameful drunkard, right?!」%K%P

0x13BC
Yuka「Shameful drunkahd!?」%K%P

0x13C8
Yuka「Aren't yuu de drunk wan here!? If yuu weren't, den%Ndere'sh nah wei yuu would have shpilled beer over me!」%K%P

0x13D4
Yuka「Or ah yuu shayin' yuu did it on purposhe!?」%K%P

0x13E0
Saki「What kind of person would do that on purpose!?」%K%P

0x13EC
Saki「That's right! If you're a 'human', then you'd never do%Nsomething like that on purpose!」%K%P

0x13F8
Saki「But somehow, it seems that 'clones' are different in that%Nregard, aren't they!?」%K%P

0x1414
Just then...%K%P

0x1430
Izumi「ENOUGH!!!」%K%P

0x143C
... Finally, Izumi-san raises her voice, unable to watch any%Nlonger. That same gentle Izumi-san.%K%N

0x1448
Her roar immediately shuts us up...%K%P

0x1454
Izumi「You're all adults here, so don't fight over such a trivial%Nthing!」%K%P

0x1460
The three of them are overwhelmed and can't face%NIzumi-san's deathly glare, staying firmly silent while%Nstaring at the ground.%K%P

0x1474
This is really awkward...%K%N

0x1480
Even though I'm a third party, I really want to run away...%K%P

0x148C
No, I might want to run away exactly because I'm a third%Nparty.%K%P

0x1498
It couldn't possibly get any worse... Saki breaks the%Nsilence and mutters something.%K%P

0x14C8
Saki「Anyway...」%K%P

0x14D4
Saki「... I'm going home now.」%K%P

0x14F0
Saki picks up her bag, which she'd placed at her feet.%K%P

0x1520
She accidently drops something.%K%P

0x152C
I look on top of the sand.%K%N

0x1538
Sprawled on the beach is the "Beef Bag"... the bag full of%Nbeef that we all paid Izumi-san to buy.%K%P

0x154C
Why does Saki...?%K%P

0x1568
Haruka「What are you planning to do... by stealing that?」%K%P

0x1574
Haruka asks her this unfalteringly.%K%P

0x1588
Saki「I'm not stealing!」%K%P

0x1594
Haruka「Then... you're taking it?」%K%P

0x15A0
Saki「... Shut up! It's not worth worrying over, is it!?」%K%P

0x15B4
Haruka「You can't do that...」%K%P

0x15C0
Haruka「Because everyone chipped in... to buy this.」%K%P

0x15D4
Saki「Geez, shut your damn mouth, you bitch!!」%K%P

0x15E0
Saki「Then why don't you report me to the police!?」%K%P

0x15F4
Saki「I won't run or hide, because I'll always be in that summer%Nhouse!」%K%P

0x1608
Saki turns around as if she's blocking something, and%Nruns towards the hill road while kicking up sand...%K%P

0x162C
The beef left on the sandy beach looks artificial, like%Nwaxwork.%K%P

0x1638
The fire under the iron plate seems like it could go out%Nany time now.%K%P

0x166C
... One minute, two minutes, and even ten minutes pass%Nwithout a single person opening their mouths.%K%P

0x1678
Why did things turn out this way?%K%N

0x1684
Just a few mere minutes ago, the air was covered with%Nthe sound of our happy laughter...%K%P

0x1690
In the end, it seems the tension between Saki and Haruka%Nreally was still weighing heavily on their minds.%K%P

0x169C
(I need to do something...)%K%P

0x16A8
(But what can I even do...?)%K%P

0x16B4
As I think this, my gaze suddenly shifts towards the%Nshadow of a distant rock.%K%P

0x16D0
Over there, alone and filled with sadness, is Kurumi...%K%P

0x16DC
Right now, she's curled up her small back while her%Nshoulders shake as she cries.%K%P

0x16E8
She lets out the sobs that have been welling up inside%Nof her... *Sob*, *sob*... *sob*, *sob*...%K%P

0x16F4
I understand Kurumi's torment so well that it almost hurts.%NKurumi's the kind of kid who can't bear such an ugly%Nargument like that...%K%P

0x1700
I think of running up to her and comforting her, but I can't%Nthink of any words I should use to do so.%K%N

0x170C
Right now... I have no choice but to stay silent...%K%P

0x173C
The sound of the waves incessantly breaking on the%Nshore is the sound of the sea's lamentations.%K%P
