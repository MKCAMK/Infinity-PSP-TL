A car with its headlights on comes driving down from the%Ntip of the curve.%K%P

0x184
Saki「!!!」%K%P

0x190
When Saki turns around and lets out a small scream, a%Npuppy trying to run leaps into my field of vision.%K%P

0x19C
The puppy is oblivious to the car, which releases a%Nsharp honk.%K%P

0x1A8
Haruka「...!」%K%P

0x1B4
Without hesitation, Haruka swiftly rushes out onto the%Nroad towards the puppy.%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「Haruka!!!」%K%P

0x1CC
Haruka quickly picks it up in her arms. Immediately%Nafterwards, the bright red frame of the car draws near%Nher...%K%P

0x250
Makoto「...!!!」%K%P

0x25C
Haruka, who's still holding the dog, draws an arc in midair.%K%P

0x268
While staring at this scene...%K%P

0x2B0
... I thankfully wake up from this nightmare.%K%P

0x2BC
... ... ...%K%P

0x2E8
I feel my whole body covered in sticky sweat.%K%N

0x2F4
When I force my mind to awaken, the sun's already risen.%K%P

0x300
I get out of my bed and pace around my room.%K%P

0x30C
By my second lap around the room, I finally realize that%Nthis is pointless, and stop.%K%P

0x334
—Today is Thursday, April 4th.%K%N

0x340
I don't have much time left.%K%P

0x34C
Before the day is over, I've got to find the decisive%Ndifference between Haruka and Kurumi!%K%P

0x358
And then... I need to protect Haruka, no matter what...!%K%P

0x364
To steel my resolve, I repeat this to myself over and%Nover again as I open the door.%K%P

0x3D0
After eating breakfast in the living room, Kurumi, Yuka,%Nand Haruka begin discussing their plans for today.%K%P

0x3DC
Like last time, Haruka says she's going fishing.%K%P

0x3E8
And so...%K%P

0x3FC
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Would it be okay if I went fishing with you?」%K%P

0x408
... I ask her this.%K%P

0x41C
Haruka nods in agreement.%K%N

0x428
She seems to be a little embarrassed as a faint smile%Nforms on her face...%K%P

0x4DC
Haruka「Makoto, what's wrong?」%K%P

0x4E8
I must have spaced out for a while, because her large%Neyes are suddenly staring directly at me.%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「No, it's nothing. I was just thinking a bit.」%K%P

0x508
Haruka「... About what?」%K%P

0x51C
Haruka seems a little annoyed, as her cheeks puff up.%K%P

0x530
Haruka「Makoto... is it fun being with me?」%K%P

0x53C
Makoto「Of course!」%K%P

0x548
I answer instantly.%K%P

0x554
It seems that Haruka is so sensitive to others' mood%Nshifts that she was able to pick up on my uneasiness%Njust from observing my speech and conduct...%K%P

0x560
(Now that I think about it...)%K%P

0x56C
I remember receiving this exact same feeling from Kurumi%Nonce...%K%P

0x578
Do the two of them share strong powers of observation%Nand insight, as well as incredible perception?%K%P

0x584
No, wait... I feel like that sensitivity is just a common%Ncharacteristic amongst girls...%K%P

0x598
Haruka「... Makoto, you've got one.」%K%P

0x5A4
Makoto「Huh? 'Got one'... what do you mean?」%K%P

0x5B8
Haruka silently points at the sea.%K%N

0x5C4
When I look, I see my fishing line is dragging out to sea..%K%P

0x5D0
... But shortly afterwards, it stops.%K%P

0x5E4
Haruka「... Or rather, you did.」%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5FC
I silently reel in the fishing line and grab the tip, but%Nthere's not even bait left.%K%P

0x608
Because I wasn't thinking about fishing, I didn't notice it%Nat all.%K%P

0x614
Whatever. I'm not really in the mood for fishing anyway,%Nso it's not like I'm particularly upset...%K%P

0x628
Haruka「Hee hee hee... looks like you lost.」%K%P

0x634
Makoto「Damn... I should be stronger than one measly fish!」%K%P

0x640
I decide to act frustrated just once in front of Haruka.%K%P

0x654
Haruka「It's because you say that that you're not catching%Nanything.」%K%P

0x660
Makoto「Ha ha ha... you might be right...」%K%P

0x66C
The sunlight sparkles on the ocean.%K%N

0x678
Haruka's smile is just as radiant as it is.%K%P

0x684
When I see that extremely natural and frank smile, it%Nmakes my own existence feel filthy by comparison.%K%P

0x690
If we were the same gender, would this feeling be%Nsomething akin to jealousy?%K%P

0x69C
As I place my next bait on the hook, I absentmindedly%Nthink about that.%K%P

0x6A8
(... They really are similar...)%K%P

0x6B4
It goes without saying that Kurumi also possesses the%Nsame disposition as Haruka.%K%P

0x6C0
They seem very different on the surface, but they really%Ndo resemble each other at that essential part.%K%P

0x6CC
... So when it comes down to it, what is the difference%Nbetween them that separates their existences?%K%P

0x6D8
Something only Haruka has... something Kurumi doesn't%Nhave... What is it...?%K%P

0x744
And so, the day ends with nothing special occurring,%Nand with tomorrow swiftly approaching.%K%P

0x750
It feels like watching a sand castle you made start to%Ncollapse... Is there nothing I can do after all?%K%P

0x75C
I spent the entire day fishing with Haruka, but in the end, I%Nwas unable to find out her decisive raison d'etre.%K%P

0x768
When night came around, we had the barbecue party.%K%P

0x774
I tried comparing Kurumi to Haruka by sight, but all I%Nended up doing was reconfirm that their external%Nsimilarities and differences won't help me out.%K%P

0x780
All I feel is my sense of restlessness starting to grow%Nstronger.%K%N

0x78C
I only have a day left...%K%P

0x798
(No, wait...)%K%P

0x7A4
I try looking back on my actions today one more time.%K%P

0x7B0
I went fishing with Haruka from the morning onwards, and%Nthen went to the barbecue...%K%P

0x7BC
When I think about it carefully, the incident between%NHaruka and Saki at the barbecue didn't happen this time.%K%P

0x7C8
Just what does that mean?%K%P

0x7D4
Does that mean that the shape of history is slowly%Nchanging!?%K%P

0x7E0
Because I was completely focused on Haruka today, I%Ncompletely overlooked this important event...%K%P

0x7EC
(Will I... get through this somehow?)%K%P

0x7F8
The flow of time is not set in stone...%K%N

0x804
I know that's a fact from the changes I've seen up until%Nnow.%K%P

0x810
But even so, I am unable to wipe away this vague feeling%Nof uneasiness.%K%P

0x81C
I throw the covers over my head and fall asleep...%K%P

0x864
... ... ...%K%P
