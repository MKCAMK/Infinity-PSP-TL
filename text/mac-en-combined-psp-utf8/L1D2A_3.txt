"Although the sunlight is strong, it's only the start of%Nspring, so it'll be a bit cold to go outside with just a%Nbathing suit on."%K%P

0xB4
"If we go to the poolside, it'd probably be best to dive%Nstraight for the water."%K%P

0xC0
... At least, I was thinking that, but to my surprise, it's%Nactually warm outside.%K%P

0xCC
It's not as hot as it would be in the summer, but it's%Npleasantly warm.%K%P

0xD8
The hedges surrounding the perimeter probably help%Nkeep out the wind.%K%P

Okuhiko「Wooow, this really nice weather we're having, huh?!」%K%P

0xF8
Suddenly, Okuhiko looks at the radiant sun while saying%Nan expression you'd expect from an enka singer.%K%P

0x104
Okuhiko「Anyway, I think we ought to thank Yuka-chan.」%K%P

0x154
Yuka「Huh? ... Why me?」%K%P

0x168
Okuhiko「Didn't you say it over the phone before we went to the%NCamp?」%K%P

0x174
Okuhiko「'Make sure to bring your swimsuit!'」%K%P

0x188
Yuka「R-Right...」%K%P

0x194
Okuhiko「No matter how close the ocean is, there's no way you%Ncan go swimming in it in this season, so I was a little%Ncurious why you said to bring one.」%K%P

0x1A0
Yuka「T-That's true...」%K%P

0x1B4
Okuhiko「But now it all makes sense. To think there would be a%Nheated pool here...」%K%P

0x1C0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「I see. I probably wouldn't have brought mine either if she%Nhadn't told us to.」%K%P

0x1D8
Okuhiko「Right. And this is why!」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「But Yuka, how did you know that there was a heated pool%Nhere?」%K%P

0x1F0
Yuka「Well... that is...」%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x210
Yuka「... I didn't know.」%K%P

0x21C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x228
Yuka「I didn't know there was a heated pool!」%K%P

0x244
Saki「What!!? Could it be that you actually said 'bring your%Nswimsuits' so that you could swim in the ocean?」%K%P

0x258
Yuka「Well... Because this is so far south, I just assumed it'd%Nalready be beach going season here...」%K%P

0x26C
Saki「Ha ha ha ha ha ha♪」%K%P

0x280
Yuka「Why are you laughing?」%K%P

0x28C
Saki「Hey, Yuka? Didn't you know that the temperature of the%Nocean is about one or two months behind the air%Ntemperature?」%K%P

0x2A0
Yuka「Huh? ... Is... that right?」%K%P

0x2AC
Saki「It is! In other words, right now, the ocean is in the middle%Nof its coldest season of the year!」%K%P

0x2C8
Izumi「Wow, you're well informed, aren't you, Saki-chan?」%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi-san praises her almost as if she was a child.%K%P

0x2E0
Saki「Going into the ocean during this season would be%Nsuicidal.」%K%P

0x2EC
Saki proudly adds this, encouraged by Izumi-san's%Npraise.%K%P

0x308
Okuhiko「Well, either way, I'd say everything still turned out well...」%K%P

0x314
Okuhiko「So I'm grateful to Yuka-chan.」%K%P

0x320
As he flips his long hair, Okuhiko sends Yuka a flirtatious%Nglance.%K%P

0x334
Okuhiko「Ah... the sun's brilliant rays are bathing us in it's light... It's%Nfilling my soul with a fiery heat!」%K%P

0x340
As he says these ridiculous words, he spreads his arms%Nand lifts his face towards the sky...%K%P

0x34C
Okuhiko「Well then, adios, amigos!」%K%P

0x360
Okuhiko leaves us with these words, and he suddenly%Nbegins running towards the poolside, diving in...%K%P

0x388
... With a "magnificent" belly dive...%K%P

0x394
A sheet of water shoots up into the air as he%Npathetically crashes into the pool.%K%P

0x3A0
He dived like a clumsy, elementary school girl who can't%Nswim.%K%P

0x3AC
However, this isn't nearly as comical... Rather, it's just%Nsad.%K%P

0x450
I look at the analog clock on the wall of the hotel, whose%Nhands are pointing to exactly noon.%K%N

0x45C
The weather is as good as ever.%K%P

0x468
Everyone else is scattered around the pool, idly%Npassing the time and having fun.%K%P

0x474
Well then, I will...%K

0x978
Get a drink.

0x984
Swim recklessly.

0x990
I want to go on the slide.

0x99C
Dive like a dolphin.

0x51C
I head over to the drink stand in order to quench my%Nthirst.%K%P

0x528
On my way there, I see Saki lying down on a deck chair.%K%P

0x59C
I have the urge to swim recklessly.%K%P

0x5A8
I don't know why, but my body is just itching to do so.%K%P

0x5B4
Is it because it's spring...?%K%P

0x5C0
Whatever the reason, I think this is what Okuhiko meant%Nwhen he said, "My soul is filled with a fiery heat."%K%P

0x5E8
I immediately dive underwater.%K%P

0x5F4
Without losing my diving speed, I start crawling up to the%Nsurface.%K%P

0x600
Rustling water begins to flow from my head to my toes.%K%P

0x60C
I swim from end to end, then do a quick turn without taking%Na breather...%K%P

0x618
Even I'm surprised at how nimble my body is.%K%P

0x624
It feels like I'm smoothly gliding along on the water's%Nsurface.%K%P

0x630
Makoto「FWAAH!」%K%P

0x63C
When I return to the start point, I gasp for air.%K%P

0x648
When I casually look up, I see someone looking down%Nupon me from the high edge of the pool.%K%P

0x6B4
For some reason, I get the urge to go down the slide.%K%P

0x6C0
I'm pretty sure I saw it right by the pool.%K%P

0x6CC
I used to love them as a kid.%K%P

0x6D8
That time... back when I still did things without thinking%Nabout them...%K%P

0x6E4
... Back when I thought of only having fun...%K%P

0x6F0
... Back when I thought I could do anything when I grew%Nup...%K%P

0x6FC
That time is very nostalgic to me...%K%P

0x708
... All right! I decide to act on my childish impulses and go%Ndown the slide!%K%P

0x714
Thankfully, there aren't any kids around right now.%K%P

0x720
If there were, it'd have been too embarrassing to try.%K%P

0x72C
... I finally arrive at the slide.%K%P

0x768
For now, I will become a dolphin...!%K%P

0x790
I take a deep breath, and dive into the pool.%K%P

0x79C
I barely avoid hitting the bottom of the pool at the last%Nsecond, and I swim towards the opposite end of the pool.%K%P

0x7A8
...%K%P

0x7B4
Air leaks out of my mouth, becoming bubbles.%K%P

0x7C0
While continuing to hold my breath, I try to make it to the%Nother side without breathing.%K%P

0x7CC
... Made it!%K%P

0x7D8
I rise to the surface.%K%P

0x7E4
Splash!!!%K%P

0x7F0
Makoto「Aaaah!」%K%P

0x7FC
I take in a deep breath of air as my face shoots out of%Nthe water.%K%P
