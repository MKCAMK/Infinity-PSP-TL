Makoto「Yuka!?」%K%P

0x50
I immediately shout.%K%N

0x5C
Yuka is leaning against the wall of the shrine, gazing off%Ntowards the dull, muddy grey ocean.%K%P

0x68
Yuka「So you came here after all.」%K%P

0x74
Yuka says this without looking at me.%K%P

0x80
Makoto「Why... Why, Yuka...?」%K%P

0x8C
Yuka「You broke your promise, huh?」%K%P

0xA8
Yuka「Even though you made that promise... to do any one%Nthing I said...」%K%P

0xBC
Yuka「You swore that you wouldn't approach the shrine again,%Nno matter what...」%K%P

0xC8
Makoto「You're a fine one to talk, aren't you!? Why did you come%Nhere?! You knew how dangerous it was!」%K%P

0xD4
Yuka doesn't respond.%K%N

0xE0
She doesn't even show a single sign that she'll answer.%K%P

0xEC
The pillars of the shrine occasionally creak as the sea%Nbreeze blows against them.%K%P

0xF8
... I look down at my feet.%K%P

0x104
I realize we're now on the very tip of the cape.%K%N

0x110
The edge of the cliff is so narrow that there is barely%Nenough room for one person to stand on it.%K%P

0x11C
The entire height from the top to the bottom of the cliff is%Nalmost as large as a skyscraper.%K%P

0x128
It's a long way down... at the very bottom, I see the%Nwaves crashing against the bare rock of the cliff,%Nsheets of water shooting up.%K%P

0x134
I cling to the back wall of the fragile shrine that's on the%Nverge of collapsing.%K%P

0x140
I observe that along with the back wall, the long eaves%Nsticking out of the shrine completely conceal and%Nisolate this area.%K%P

0x14C
In other words, the edge of the cliff is so shrewdly%Nhidden that most would have been oblivious to its%Nexistence.%K%P

0x158
In other words, the only way to get back to the other%Nside of the shrine is to pass through that small square%Nexit.%K%P

0x164
Yuka「We're really idiots, aren't we?」%K%P

0x170
Yuka suddenly mutters this.%K%P

0x17C
Yuka「In the end, it was just a superstition... It's just as you%Nsaid...」%K%P

0x188
Yuka「But perhaps in the past, it might not have been a%Nsuperstition...」%K%P

0x194
As she says this, Yuka kicks a pebble at her feet.%K%P

0x1A0
The small pebble rolls off the cliff and disappears.%K%P

0x1AC
Yuka「I realized it last night...」%K%P

0x1B8
Yuka「'The spring rain/ At the end of the cape/ Together with/%NThe echoing bell/ Will free you from time.'」%K%P

0x1C4
Yuka「That 'At the end of the cape' part is talking about behind%Nthe shrine... in other words, I thought that it was referring%Nto here...」%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「Wait a minute, Yuka. So the reason you came here was...」%K%P

0x1DC
Yuka「Yes, that's right...」%K%P

0x1E8
Yuka「I wanted to go back to the past, no matter what...」%K%P

0x1F4
Makoto「Wh-Why...?」%K%P

0x200
Yuka「But you know what? It seems that the 'end of the cape'%Nis already gone...」%K%P

0x20C
Yuka is clearly dodging the question.%K%P

0x218
Yuka「In the past, the tip of this cape was definitely just a bit%Nlonger...」%K%P

0x224
Yuka「But over a long period of time, the tip of the cape was%Nslowly eroded by the waves until it tumbled into the sea...」%K%P

0x230
Yuka「That's why... even if that story wasn't a superstition now...」%K%P

0x24C
Yuka「No one can go back to the past anymore...」%K%P

0x274
Yuka kicks another pebble.%K%P

0x280
(She wanted to go back to the past... What was she%Nplanning to do there...!?)%K%P

0x28C
I can't think of any plausible reason...%K%P

0x298
(But... I'm glad she's safe...)%K%P

0x2A4
Seeing Yuka's smile gives me a feeling of relief.%K%P

0x2B0
The sky is covered in black rain clouds, but they get%Nbrighter and brighter in proportion to the passing time.%K%P

0x2BC
I look at my watch.%K%P

0x2C8
(5:32 A.M.)... If only these rain clouds weren't here, we'd%Nbe able to see the bright red sun rise from the horizon...%K%P

0x2D4
Well, we don't have that kind of luxury.%K%N

0x2E0
Anyway, nothing's happened. That's good enough...%K%P

0x2EC
The instant I sigh in relief, a sudden chill assaults me.%K%N

0x2F8
I ran through this downpour without an umbrella. It's only%Nnatural that I'm cold.%K%P

0x304
In an attempt to warm up my body a little, I casually put%Nmy hands in my pockets.%K%P

0x310
—Huh?%K%P

0x31C
I feel my fingertips brush against what feels like paper.%K%P

0x328
I pull whatever it is out of my pocket.%K%P

0x334
A paper bag???%K%P

0x340
Right... it's the paper bag Haruka gave me... I'd put it away%Nin my pocket.%K%P

0x34C
"Do you want something good?"%K%N

0x358
—In here must be that "something good" Kurumi was%Ntalking about.%K%P

0x364
I tear the paper bag open, and take out what was inside%Nit.%K%N

0x370
—There's two things: a pure white lump of cotton and a%Nscrap of paper.%K%P

0x37C
I check the scrap of paper first. It seems to be a short%Nletter.%K%P

0x388
I read it.%K%P

0x394
"Dear Onii-chan... Kurumi found this this afternoon on%NMoon Beach."%K%P

0x3A0
"It's very pretty, so she'll give it to you♪ ... From Kurumi."%K%P

0x3AC
She found this lump of cotton?%K%N

0x3B8
No... when I feel it carefully, I can tell the cotton is%Nwrapping up something.%K%P

0x3C4
I carefully begin to tear off the layers of cotton...%K%P

0x404
—A shudder runs through me!%K%P

0x48C
I immediately look away, and close my palm into a fist...%K%P

0x498
(It's impossible...)%K%P

0x4A4
(It's impossible...)%K%P

0x4B0
(It's impossible...!!!)%K%P

0x4BC
The blood rushing throughout my body starts boiling.%K%P

0x4E0
Yuka「Why... Why do you...!?」%K%P

0x4EC
Yuka's face has gone pale, as if she's a wax model.%K%P

0x4F8
Yuka saw it...%K%N

0x504
The thing in my palm... the bell!%K%P

0x518
Immediately after that, Yuka arm becomes as stiff as a%Npole, and she suddenly reaches it out in front of me.%K%P

0x524
She slowly opens her trembling palm...%K%P

0x550
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x55C
I can't breathe.%K%N

0x568
I can't even speak.%K%P

0x574
My mouth is dry.%K%N

0x580
My spine is as stiff as iron.%K%P

0x594
Yuka「Wh... What's the meaning of this...???」%K%P

0x5A0
Yuka「Why are there... two bells...???」%K%P

0x5AC
Makoto「Y-Yuka...」%K%P

0x5B8
It takes everything I've got to say that word.%K%P

0x5C4
Makoto「Yuka... you said you threw it away... didn't you...?」%K%P

0x5D8
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x5E4
Yuka「But...!」%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「Were... you lying...?」%K%P

0x5FC
Yuka nods, her body trembling.%K%P

0x608
Yuka「But more importantly... Makoto... where did that bell you%Nhave now come from...?」%K%P

0x614
Makoto「I don't know... I don't... know...」%K%P

0x620
I shake my head countless times.%K%P

0x62C
I finally regain the ability to think calmly.%K%P

0x638
There's no time for a leisurely conversation!!%K%P

0x644
We've got more dire things to worry about right now!%K%P

0x650
Makoto「Anyway, let's get out of here right away! We can talk%Nlater!」%K%P

0x65C
I grab Yuka's arm with my free hand.%K%P

0x668
Yuka「...The bell?」%K%P

0x674
Yuka says this.%K%P

0x680
—That's right!%K%N

0x68C
First, I've got to get rid of this bell!%K%P

0x698
The fact that I didn't realize such a basic thing proves%Nhow much of a panic my mind is in.%K%P

0x6A4
... I immediately...%K

0x6B0
... take out the bell...%K%N

0x6BC
... and prepare...%K

0x6C8
... to cast it into the ocean...%K%P

0x6EC
—But at that instant!!%K%P

0x748
A-An earthquake...?%K%P

0x754
—CRASH!%K%N

0x760
My ears are pierced by a roaring sound coming from%Nbehind me.%K%N

0x76C
I turn around...%K%P

0x778
—Rumble rumble!!%K%N

0x784
Once again, I hear the high-pitched sound of something%Ncracking.%K%P

0x790
And along with it, I feel the shrine's wall that we're leaning%Nagainst tilting towards us!%K%N

0x79C
Over the panicked Yuka's shoulder, I can see segments%Nof the thick pillars breaking up into small wood chips as%Nthey blow up in the air.%K%P

0x7A8
The eaves sticking out from overhead are weightily%Nlooming over us!%K%P

0x7B4
With our feet on the cliff... there's nowhere to run!%K%P

0x7C0
—What should I do!?%K%P

0x7CC
I hesitate for a moment.%K%N

0x7D8
The ocean? No, from this height, it'd be suicide!%K%P

0x7E4
Right now, at least...%K%N

0x7F0
At the very least, Yuka alone should...%K%N

0x7FC
With all of my strength, I kick off the ground, and leap%Ntowards Yuka...%K%P

0x8AC
I'm so... cold...%K%N

0x8B8
My whole body has gone numb. I can't move.%K%P

0x8C4
Strangely, there's no pain.%K%P

0x8D0
All there is is the taste of rusty iron in my mouth...%K%N

0x8DC
All of my other senses are completely paralyzed.%K%P

0x8E8
Suddenly, I am assaulted with severe nausea.%K%P

0x8F4
I throw it all up.%K%P

0x910
Blood...%K%N

0x91C
I threw so much blood that I could drown in it...%K%P

0x928
The blood won't stop, as it overflows in my mouth and%Nguzzles down my throat.%K%P

0x934
It seems I'm bleeding from other parts besides my mouth.%K%P

0x940
My neck?%K%N

0x94C
Did I cut an artery in my neck?%K%N

0x958
The blood begins to flow out of me relentlessly, like a%Nfaucet that's been left on full blast.%K%P

0x964
My consciousness slowly begins to fade...%K%P

0x970
I close my eyes partly, and focus my faint, dim field of%Nvision..%K%P

0x97C
Right in front of me...%K%N

0x988
... lies Yuka.%K%P

0x99C
I can see her heavily dangling palm.%K%P

0x9A8
On top of it is a small fragment of light...%K%P

0x9B4
—The bell.%K%P

0x9C0
It's so painful...%K%N

0x9CC
It hurts like hell.%K%P

0x9D8
I'm writhing in agony from the pain that feels like it's%Nclawing at my heart.%K%N

0x9E4
But it's not physical pain.%K%P

0x9F0
My heart...%K%N

0x9FC
My heart... feels like it's been gouged out by a sharp%Nknife.%K%P

0xA08
I broke my vow...%K%P

0xA14
Even though I swore that "I will definitely protect Yuka"...%K%P

0xA20
I was too late...%K%N

0xA2C
I was just an instant too late...%K%N

0xA38
If I hadn't hesitated in that one instant...%K%P

0xA44
I could have... protected Yuka.%K%P

0xA50
Even so...%K%N

0xA5C
Even so...%K%P

0xA68
I muster the last of my strength to crawl like an insect%Nover to Yuka's side.%K%P

0xA74
In my arms, I feel Yuka's skin is wet with slippery blood...%K%N

0xA80
Her cheeks are ghastly pale, almost transparent...%K%N

0xA8C
As if she were a doll made of glass.%K%P

0xA98
Yuka「Why...」%K%P

0xAA4
Her hoarse voice fills this empty void.%K%P

0xAB0
Many tears pour down her face nonstop.%K%P

0xABC
Before long, from Yuka's palm...%K%P

0xAD0
... the bell falls.%K%P

0xADC
And from my palm as well...%K%P

0xB14
... the bell slips out and falls.%K%P

0xB2C
At that moment...%K%N

0xB38
—All light fades.%K%P
