Having been ditched by Kurumi, I go to Lunabeach to%Nsatisfy my hunger.%K%P

0x4C
Of course, I'm also concerned about what Kurumi said%Nearlier...%K%P

0x60
Izumi「Oh, Makoto-kun. Welcome♪」%K%P

0x88
When I enter the shop, Izumi-san greets me, smiling as%Nalways.%K%P

0x94
Izumi「Where's Kurumi? I heard the two of you were together.」%K%P

0xA0
Kurumi... Right. Kurumi said that Izumi-san has some sort%Nof connection to my college...%K%P

0xAC
Curious, I stare at Izumi-san's face.%K%P

What should I do...?%K%P

Well, there's no harm in asking, I suppose...%K%P

0x10C
Makoto「Hey, I heard it from Kurumi, but...」%K%P

0x118
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x124
Makoto「... Izumi-san, do you have some connection to my%Ncollege?」%K%P

0x13C
Izumi「Hee hee hee... Geez, if Kurumi said it, I guess it can't be%Nhelped...」%K%P

0x148
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x154
Izumi「... The truth is, I'm a graduate from your college,%NMakoto-kun.」%K%P

0x160
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x16C
Izumi「Are you surprised?」%K%P

0x178
Makoto「Y-Yes... It was quite unexpected.」%K%P

0x184
Izumi「It's not like it was something I was trying to hide, but I%Nnever felt it was necessary to mention it...」%K%P

0x190
Izumi「Though I feel like I should have done so earlier...」%K%P

0x19C
Izumi「I suppose it's because it's embarrassing to think that%Nwe could have unwittingly missed each other on campus%N...」%K%P

0x1A8
(Oh... so that's all it was...)%K%P

0x1B4
(Izumi-san is a graduate from my college...)%K%P

0x1C0
(It really is a small world...)%K%P

0x1CC
What are the odds of that?%K%P

0x214
... ... ...%K%P

0x24C

0x31C
Izumi「But I'm running the shop, you know?」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「Yes.」%K%P

0x334
I have no idea where she's trying to go with this, so I just%Nnod my head.%K%P

0x348
Izumi「That's why I want you to help with the preparations as%Nwell.」%K%P

0x354
Makoto「I see...%T060 What?」%K%P

Izumi「Thank you, Makoto-kun♪」%K%P

0x424
Izumi-san takes my hand and grasps it tightly as she%Nsays this.%K%P

0x430
But maybe she's gripping it a little too tightly...%K%P

0x43C
(Is this really something to get overjoyed about?)%K%P

0x448
Although I think that, seeing Izumi-san's beaming smiling%Nface causes my heart to skip a beat.%K%P

0x484
Izumi「Can you do a favor for me?」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「... Crap! I just remembered! The truth is, there's something%NI have to do. Sorry, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x4A4
Izumi「Whaaaat, really?」%K%P

0x4B0
Izumi-san pouts.%K%P

0x4BC
Of course, I have nothing to do. I just quickly came up%Nwith an excuse.%K%P

0x4C8
I don't think it's fair if I'm the only one helping out with%Npreparations.%K%P

0x4D4
Long story short... it's too much of a hassle.%K%P

0x4E8
Izumi「... I see. Then it can't be helped.」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「I'm really sorry.」%K%P

0x500
Izumi「No, it doesn't really matter. I was planning to go on my%Nown, anyway.」%K%P

0x50C
Izumi「Besides, as you can see, the shop's as empty as%Nalways... There's more than enough time to take care of%Neverything, so it should be okay.」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「... Right. Well, good luck. Thanks for the food.」%K%P

0x52C
Izumi「Yes. Well then, don't be late for the meeting time, okay?」%K%P

0x538
Makoto「Ha ha, I'll be fine.」%K%P

0x544
With those words, I leave Lunabeach.%K%P

0x574
... ... ...%K%P

0x580
Before long, the sun is setting, and the promised time%Narrives.%K%P

0x58C
We meet at Lunabeach, where we all pitch in carrying the%Ntools needed for the barbecue to Princess Beach.%K%P

0x598
And then...%K%P
