It's past 10:00... Kurumi got tired of talking, as she%Nheaded up to Lunabeach's second floor while rubbing%Nher sleepy eyes.%K%P

0x188
Like last time, Izumi-san and I find ourselves all alone.%K%P

0x194
I plan on going back to the lodge soon.%K%P

0x1A0
If I stay here... Well, I don't think it's as likely, but... I think%Nthe same thing as the last time I was in this situation%Nmight happen again.%K%P

0x1AC
I repeatedly tell myself that I need to say goodbye to%Nher and leave, but I keep feeling like the timing isn't%Nexactly right.%K%P

0x1B8
Instead, we continue to chatter on about trivial things...%K%P

0x1C4
It's as if even Izumi-san herself is trying to wait for some%Nkind of timing as well.%K%P

0x1D0
Exactly two hours have passed since Kurumi went up to%Ngo to sleep.%K%P

0x1DC
The date display on my watch has already changed to%Nthe 6th...%K%P

0x244
Makoto「Well then... it's about time I get going.」%K%P

0x250
I try to stand up.%K%P

0x264
Izumi「Makoto-kun...!」%K%P

0x270
Izumi-san frantically restrains me.%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「Wh-What is it?」%K%P

0x288
Izumi「Makoto-kun... I'm wondering if you could tell me... the rest%Nof that story?」%K%P

0x2BC
My heart beats loudly.%K%N

0x2C8
I have a bad feeling about this...%K%N

0x2D4
A very bad feeling...%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Izumi-san, I really need to get ba-」%K%P

0x30C
Izumi「Makoto-kun... did you know about Kurumi's scar...?」%K%P

0x318
Makoto「We can talk about that tomorrow!」%K%P

0x33C
Izumi「'Kurumi is my real sister'... Why did you declare that back%Nthen?」%K%P

0x348
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x354
I immediately glance towards the shop's stairway.%K%N

0x360
It's all right... Kurumi still hasn't come down yet...%K%P

0x36C
I lower my voice...%K%P

0x378
Makoto「What would you do if Kurumi heard!?」%K%P

0x384
... and scold her.%K%P

0x390
Alarmed, Izumi-san also looks towards the staircase...%K%P

0x39C
Izumi「It's all right... once she sleeps, she definitely won't wake%Nup.」%K%P

0x3A8
Makoto「That's not true! Last time-」%K%P

0x3B4
Izumi「Last time...?」%K%P

0x3C0
I'm getting very irritated.%K%N

0x3CC
Just tell her everything—I'm doing everything in my%Npower to resist that impulse.%K%P

0x3E0
Izumi「Hey? How could you say that without any doubts?」%K%P

0x3EC
Izumi「Tell me, Makoto-kun! I want to know the truth too!」%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「...」%K

0x1B30
Tell her everything.

0x1B3C
Ignore her and stand up.

0x440
Makoto「I understand... I'll tell you everything...」%K%P

0x44C
I've resolved myself.%K%P

0x458
Makoto「But there's no way we can talk about it here... Will you%Ncome with me?」%K%P

0x46C
Izumi-san silently nods.%K%P

0x4E4
Izumi-san and I walk to the center of Moon Beach.%K%P

0x4F0
If we go this far, then there's probably no way Kurumi%Ncould hear us talking.%K%P

0x4FC
The beach is empty, being completely devoid of people%Nexcept for us.%K%P

0x508
I slowly begin to talk as the cold night wind blows by...%K%P

0x514
Makoto「After hearing your story... this is how I would sum it up.」%K%P

0x520
Makoto「Kurumi was born 21 years ago, and one month later,%Nsomeone kidnapped her.」%K%P

0x52C
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x538
Makoto「Seven days after the crime was committed, the%Nkidnapper died when the Shiki no Mori Shrine was%Ndestroyed...」%K%P

0x544
Makoto「... And three years later, Kurumi was discovered in the%Nrebuilt shrine.」%K%P

0x550
Makoto「But, for some reason, her body was the same as when%Nshe had been kidnapped... She hadn't aged at all.」%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「That's why you have doubts that the baby was the real%NKurumi... am I right?」%K%P

0x570
Izumi「Yes... that's right...」%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「But you know, what, Izumi-san? That baby was definitely%N'Kurumi'!」%K%P

0x588
Makoto「The scar on Kurumi's back—that's the biggest proof%Nof all.」%K%P

0x59C
Izumi「Huh...? The scar...? That scar is... the proof?」%K%P

0x5A8
I firmly nod in reply as I continue.%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「When that shrine was destroyed... Kurumi was definitely%Nalso in there with the kidnapper...」%K%P

0x5C0
Makoto「Kurumi received that scar from the incident...」%K%P

0x5D4
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x5E0
Makoto「In other words...」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「—Kurumi time traveled three years into the future!」%K%P

0x600
Izumi「... What?」%K%P

0x60C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x620
Izumi「Makoto-kun... are you mocking me?」%K%P

0x62C
Makoto「I-Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x640
Izumi「... Was that... Was that nothing more than a joke?」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「I'm not joking! I'm being completely serious here!」%K%P

0x670
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「You won't believe me?」%K%P

0x688
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x694
Makoto「But I'm telling the truth about the time tra-」%K%P

0x6A8
Izumi「I understand... I understand already... Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x6B4
Izumi「Thank you...」%K%P

0x6C8
Izumi「You were trying to give me peace of mind, weren't you?」%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「You're wrong, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x6E8
Izumi「That's enough... I really... understand, so...」%K%P

0x6F4
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x700
Izumi-san's shoulders drop.%K%N

0x70C
She passes by me while keeping her head down.%K%P

0x718
(So she didn't... believe me after all...)%K%P

0x724
But it's something that can't be helped.%K%N

0x730
Who the hell would believe such a strange, ridiculous%Nstory anyway!?%K%P

0x73C
Even I myself would have thought it was complete bullshit%Nif I hadn't personally experienced time travel myself.%K%P

0x748
I'm beyond irritated, but I've already given up on%Neverything.%K%N

0x754
There's no one who will believe my story...%K%P

0x7B0
Izumi-san is waiting for me by the front door to%NLunabeach.%K%P

0x7BC
I...%K%P

0x7C8
Makoto「Goodnight...」%K%P

0x7D4
... just say that word to Izumi-san, and try to take my%Nleave.%K%P

0x7E0
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x7EC
I turn around to face her.%K%P

0x800
Izumi「Makoto-kun... don't worry, I'll be fine.」%K%P

0x80C
Suddenly, I see something moving from over Izumi-san's%Nshoulder...%K%P

0x820
Izumi「It's as I said yesterday...」%K%P

0x82C
The shop's door—on the other side of that glass%Ndoor...%K%P

0x838
Izumi「I think of Kurumi... as my real sister.」%K%P

0x844
A person...%K%P

0x858
Izumi「Even if we have different parents...」%K%P

0x864
Makoto「I... Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x870
Izumi「That has nothing to do with it...」%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「Izumi-san!!」%K%P

0x890
Izumi「It has nothing to do with being related by blood!」%K%P

0x89C
Izumi「Rather, it's because we're not blood related sisters%Nthat-」%K%P

0x8E0
—A sudden noise.%K%P

0x8F4
That sound causes Izumi-san to jump back as she turns%Naround.%K%P

0x900
(No way...)%K%P

0x93C
I brush past Izumi-san, and quickly open the door.%K%P

0x950
Izumi「K... Kurumi...」%K%P

0x95C
My heart stops.%K%P

0x968
Kurumi「Is it true?」%K%P

0x974
Kurumi「Is it really true?」%K%P

0x980
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x98C
Kurumi「Kurumi isn't Onee-chan's... sister?」%K%P

0x998
Makoto「You're wrong! You and Izumi-san are-」%K%P

0x9AC
Kurumi「You liar...」%K%P

0x9B8
Kurumi「Everyone... Everyone... is deceiving Kurumi...」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「Kurumi! Please, listen to-」%K%P

0x9D8
Kurumi「YOU LIAR!!」%K%P

0xA08
Kurumi turns around, and rushes right into Lunabeach.%K%P

0xA14
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0xA74
I run as fast as I can after her.%K%P

0xA9C
Kurumi runs right through the shop while mowing down the%Nchairs and tables...%K%P

0xAA8
The terrace seems to be a dead end, but Kurumi jumps%Ndown off of it onto Moon Beach without hesitation.%K%P

0xAD0
I also immediately jump over the handrail...%K%P

0xD04
—Wham!%K%N

0xD10
Intense pain runs through my body!%K%N

0xD1C
A dip in the sand has twisted my ankle.%K%P

0xD28
Next to me is Kurumi, who's sitting on her knees.%K%N

0xD34
She stands up... and I grab her firmly by the shoulders.%K%P

0xD80
Kurumi is crying.%K%P

0xD8C
Large teardrops begin to pour out of her eyes...%K%P

0xD98
She keeps wiping them away with her palms, but more%Ntears just keep on coming.%K%P

0xDA4
Kurumi「Everyone... everyone... is deceiving... Kurumi...」%K%P

0xDB0
Makoto「You're wrong, Kurumi! Listen to me!」%K%P

0xDBC
I firmly shake Kurumi by the shoulders.%K%N

0xDC8
Kurumi flinches from my shouts...%K%P

0xDD4
But... just how should I explain this!?%K

0x1B48
Tell her about the time travel.

0x1B54
There has to be another method...

0xE14
Makoto「All right? Listen closely, Kurumi.」%K%P

0xE20
Kurumi only continues to cry.%K%P

0xE2C
In the corner of my field of vision, I see a dumbfounded%NIzumi-san standing on the terrace.%K%P

0xE38
Makoto「You and Izumi-san are true blood related sisters.」%K%P

0xE44
Makoto「Kurumi, you time traveled...」%K%P

0xE50
Makoto「... from that shrine!」%K%P

0xE5C
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xE68
Makoto「The scar on your back... is the proof.」%K%P

0xE74
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xE80
Makoto「During the incident where that shrine collapsed, you%Nwere the-」%K%P

0xE8C
Kurumi「Onii-chan...」%K%P

0xE98
Kurumi「What... shrine...?」%K%P

0xEA4
Makoto「R-Right... like I was saying-」%K%P

0xEB0
Kurumi「What 'incident'...?」%K%P

0xEBC
Makoto「That is...」%K%P

0xEC8
Kurumi「Onii-chan... Kurumi doesn't understand...」%K%P

0xED4
Kurumi「'Time travel'...?」%K%P

0xEE0
Makoto「That's right. Like I was saying, you time traveled...」%K%P

0xEEC
Kurumi「Why...?」%K%P

0xEF8
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xF04
Kurumi「Why are... you lying like that...?」%K%P

0xF10
Makoto「It's not a lie!」%K%P

0xF1C
Kurumi「Did you think... you could deceive... Kurumi?」%K%P

0xF28
Makoto「You're wrong! You're wrong, Kurumi! Trust me!」%K%P

0xF34
Kurumi「There's no way Kurumi would believe a story like that!」%K%P

0xF40
Makoto「Kurumi...」%K%P

0xF54
Makoto「All right? Listen closely, Kurumi.」%K%P

Kurumi「Onii-chan, why do you know that?」%K%P

0xFB4
Makoto「Th-That's... because-」%K%P

0xFC8
I say nothing and stand up.%K%P

0xFD4
I feel bad for Izumi-san, but all I can do is ignore her and%Nset out to leave.%K%P

0xFE0
However...%K%P

0xFF4
Izumi「Are Kurumi and I...」%K%P

0x1000
Makoto「Izumi-san!!」%K%P

Izumi「Really blood related...」%K%P

Izumi「Or not...?」%K%P

Izumi「K... Kurumi...」%K%P

Makoto「Kurumi! Please, listen to-」%K%P

0x10E0
Kurumi「YOU LIAR!!」%K%P

0x1154
Kurumi runs out of Lunabeach!%K%P

0x1160
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0x116C
Without hesitating, I jump over the handrail onto Moon%NBeach.%K%N

0x1178
That's right! I'll get there before she does!%K%P

0x13AC
—Wham!%K%N

0x13B8
Intense pain runs through my body!%K%N

0x13C4
A dip in the sand has twisted my ankle.%K%P

0x13D0
I then see Kurumi as she rounds the side of the shop,%Ncoming close.%K%P

0x13DC
She runs directly in front of me, giving me the chance for%Nme to grab her by the shoulders.%K%P

0x1428
Kurumi is crying.%K%P

0x1434
Large teardrops begin to pour out of her eyes...%K%P

0x1440
She keeps wiping them away with her palms, but more%Ntears just keep on coming.%K%P

0x144C
Kurumi「Everyone... everyone... is deceiving... Kurumi...」%K%P

0x1458
Makoto「You're wrong, Kurumi! Listen to me!」%K%P

0x1464
I firmly shake Kurumi by the shoulders.%K%N

0x1470
Kurumi flinches from my shouts...%K%P

0x147C
But... just how should I explain this!?%K

0x1B60
Tell her about the time travel.

0x1B6C
There has to be another method...

0x14BC
Makoto「All right? Listen closely, Kurumi.」%K%P

0x14C8
Kurumi only continues to cry.%K%P

0x14D4
In the corner of my field of vision, I see a dumbfounded%NIzumi-san standing on the terrace.%K%P

0x14E0
Makoto「You and Izumi-san are true blood related sisters.」%K%P

0x14EC
Makoto「As for how, I will explain that now.」%K%P

0x14F8
Makoto「Kurumi, you were born 21 years ago.」%K%P

0x1504
Makoto「And one month later, someone kidnapped you.」%K%P

0x1510
Makoto「Seven days after the crime was committed, the%Nkidnapper died when the Shiki no Mori Shrine was%Ndestroyed.」%K%P

0x151C
Makoto「The truth is, you were there with the kidnapper at that%Ntime.」%K%P

0x1528
Makoto「You received the scar on your back from the incident.」%K%P

0x1534
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x1540
Makoto「And three years later, you were discovered in the%Nrebuilt shrine.」%K%P

0x154C
Makoto「But your body was the same as when you had been%Nkidnapped for some reason... you hadn't aged at all.」%K%P

0x1558
Makoto「That's why a lot of people thought 'There's no way that%Nbaby can be Kurumi'.」%K%P

0x1564
Makoto「And as a result, it caused the misunderstanding that%Nyou and Izumi-san weren't blood related.」%K%P

0x1570
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x157C
Makoto「But you know what, Kurumi? That baby was definitely you.」%K%P

0x1588
Makoto「The scar on your back— that's the proof.」%K%P

0x1594
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x15A0

0x167C
Kurumi「Onii-chan, why do you know that?」%K%P

0x1688
Makoto「Th-That's... because-」%K%P

0x16A4
Kurumi「Stop lying already!」%K%P

0x16B0
Kurumi「Papa... Mama... Onee-chan... and Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x16BC
Kurumi「... Kurumi hates them...」%K%P

0x16C8
Kurumi「I hate you!」%K%P

0x16D4
Kurumi「I HATE EVERYONE!!」%K%P

0x16E8
Kurumi shakes off of my grasp.%K%N

0x16F4
She turns around... and breaks off into a run.%K%N

0x1700
I barely manage to grab onto the hem of her clothes.%K%P

0x1728
Kurumi trips and falls down on the beach.%K%N

0x1734
In that instant...%K%P

0x1784
—The bell!!!%K%P

0x1790
(Th-That's... impossible!!!!!)%K%P

0x179C
Kurumi picks up the bell and stands up.%K%N

0x17A8
She darts across the beach.%K%P

0x17B4
I try to pursue her, but the instant I take a step forward%Non the beach...%K%P

0x17C0
—Pain runs through my body!%K%P

0x17CC
It shoots up towards my brain, numbing it.%K%N

0x17D8
I squat to stop myself from collapsing.%K%N

0x17E4
I firmly clench my teeth to endure the pain.%K%P

0x17F0
(I can't let Kurumi go off now!)%K%P

0x17FC
I see Kurumi's retreating figure steadily begin to%Ndisappear.%K%N

0x1808
I start running... every time I take a step forward, pain%Nrushes through my whole body.%K%P

0x1814
But I have to run.%K%N

0x1820
I have to follow Kurumi.%K%P

0x182C
I don't want to lose her.%K%N

0x1838
I don't want Kurumi's smile to disappear.%K%P

0x1844
(Even though I vowed never to hurt Kurumi again...)%K%P

0x1850
I step forward while enduring the pain.%K%P

0x185C
I run and run, but Kurumi's figure only gets smaller and%Nsmaller.%K%P

0x1868
Kurumi disappears...%K%N

0x1874
She disappears over the banks...%K%P

0x1880
I lose all my strength, and collapse on the beach.%K%N

0x188C
My head is going blank.%K%N

0x1898
My consciousness... slowly starts to fade...%K%P

0x18A4
Makoto「Kurumi...」%K%P
