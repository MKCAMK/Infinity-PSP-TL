"Then let's sneak in and check out the heated pool!"%K%P

0x68
... Everyone ends up heading to Tsukiya Hotel as a result%Nof my comment.%K%P

0x74
On the way there...%K%P

0x80
I secretly approach Izumi-san, and whisper in her ear.%K%P

0x94
Makoto「Izumi-san... you'll have to fall again...」%K%P

0xA0
Izumi「It's fine... don't worry about it.」%K%P

0xAC
Makoto「But I feel bad for you...%K If you don't want to, we can%Nchange history...」%K%P

0xB8
Izumi「We can't. If we don't do these things properly, then won't%NOkuhiko-kun just get suspicious?」%K%P

0xC4
Izumi「And besides, there's also the fact that... we need to%Nthink about the actions we'll have to take at times we%Nmake mistakes or screw up.」%K%P

0xD0
Izumi「Even if we don't know how long he'll continue to be%Ndeceived, there's no way he won't get suspicious event-」%K%P

0x118
Okuhiko「What are you doing, you two?」%K%P

0x124
Okuhiko「Were you discussing something you didn't want me to%Nhear?」%K%P

0x138
—Oh crap!%K%P

0x14C
Okuhiko「... Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x160
Whew... we've been saved by his naivety...%K%P

0x16C
Reluctantly, we end our conversation.%K%P

0x178
I wish we could make an excuse so we could leave and%Ncontinue it elsewhere.%K%P

0x1B8
I become extremely lonely.%K%P

0x1C4
As long as we're in front of Okuhiko, Izumi-san and I can't%Neven have a normal conversation.%K%P

0x1D0
It goes without saying that having any sort of intimate%Nexchange is forbidden.%K%P

0x1DC
We have to keep pretending that it's the past until the%Nbitter end...%K%P

0x1E8
(Izumi-san... I want to be with her.)%K%P

0x1F4
(I want to talk about many different things.)%K%P

0x200
(I want to ask her more things that I don't know.)%K%P

0x20C
I finally realize how much I'm hating all the precious time I%Nlose with her, but the show must go on.%K%P

0x218
Always, until this is finally... over.%K%P

0x224
I begin to regret starting this mock play of ours.%K%P

0x230
I was really pumped up at the beginning, but that no%Nlonger matters...%K%P

0x23C
To me... it doesn't mean as much as the endless, ever%Nexpanding feelings I have for Izumi-san... I just want to%Ntell her that, no matter what.%K%P

0x248
But there's no way I can stop now.%K%P

0x254
Everyone else is eager and giving it all they've got, so if%NI stop now, they might think of me as a man who leaves%Nthings unfinished.%K%P

0x260
I don't really care what the others think... It's just that I%Ndon't want Izumi-san to misunderstand.%K%P

0x26C
Izumi-san is a fully grown woman. She would definitely%Nhate such a man.%K%P

0x278
I... just don't want Izumi-san to hate me.%K%P

0x284
Until the end, I have no choice but to be patient...%K%P

0x290
But it's very unlikely that I'll be able to keep my feelings%Nbottled up inside me that long...%K%P

0x29C
So... I'll wait for a time when Izumi-san and I are away from%NOkuhiko... Then I'll tell her how I feel about her.%K%P

0x2A8
(If Okuhiko weren't here...)%K%P

0x2B4
While my heart pounds with anticipation, I try to hide my%Nrestlessness...%K%P

0x330
We arrive at the pool as I'm thinking about this.%K%P

0x33C
We all continue to act out the same things we did in the%Npast.%K%P

0x348
Even the deceived Okuhiko does the same things he did%Nthen.%K%P

0x354
It's like re-watching a scene in a movie... It's rather%Nsurreal.%K%P

0x360
It's getting hard to tell who's deceiving who now.%K%P

0x36C
And then, Izumi-san and Kurumi play together, and%NIzumi-san falls into the pool.%K%P

0x378
To put it accurately, she throws herself into the pool...%K%P

0x384
Her wet, transparent clothes... Her pale skin...%K%N

0x390
It seems that Izumi-san is very conscious of my stare...%K%P

0x39C
My heart is beating much faster than it was back then.%K%P

0x3E4
... ... ...%K%P

0x42C
... That night, after Okuhiko goes to sleep...%K%P

0x438
We all meet at Lunabeach so that Okuhiko doesn't find%Nout about our plan.%K%P

0x444
Of course, it's our strategy meeting for tomorrow.%K%P

0x458
Izumi「Hey, what day is tomorrow again?」%K%P

0x46C
Yuka「Umm, let's see... 'Tomorrow' is April 2nd, so...」%K%P

0x488
Kurumi「That's when we go to the pool♪ See, didn't we make that%Npromise today to go back to the pool?」%K%P

0x49C
Saki「Yes, that's right. Everyone goes to the pool tomorrow.」%K%P

0x4B0
... This is a strange conversation, no matter how you look%Nat it.%K%P

0x4BC
If strangers saw us, they'd probably think that we were%Nsome sort of bogus religious cult, conducting a%Nceremony to predict the future.%K%P

0x4C8
But that's fine.%K%N

0x4D4
We can see tomorrow.%K%N

0x4E0
We're time travelers, from a certain point of view...%K%P

0x4EC
We're going to the pool tomorrow.%K%N

0x4F8
And then, Yuka will get drunk...%K She'll demand to eat fresh%Ntoro...%K We'll head off to go fishing...%K%N

0x504
And then... huh?%K%P

0x520
Makoto「... H-Hey. Isn't tomorrow when...」%K%P

0x534
Saki looks taken aback.%K It seems she's realized it too.%K%P

0x55C
Saki「... W-Wait a minute! Tomorrow's when I almost drown, isn't it!?」%K%P

0x568
Yuka「... Ah.」%K%P

0x574
Izumi「... Ah.」%K%P

0x580
Kurumi「Ah〜!」%K%P

0x58C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x5A0
Saki「Do I have to fall into the ocean again?」%K%P

0x5AC
Everyone「...」%K%P

0x5B8
Saki「N-No... no way in hell! After all, I might actually die this time%Naround...」%K%P

0x5D4
Izumi「Hmm... This is a problem...」%K%P

0x5F0
Yuka「Don't worry, Saki. It's all right♪ Izumi-san will definitely%Nsave you again♪」%K%P

0x60C
Saki「Yuka! You've never almost drowned before, so you don't%Nhave the right to talk! I do! I almost drowned!!」%K%P

0x620
Yuka「That's not true. I couldn't swim when I was in elementary%Nschool...」%K%P

0x634
Saki「Yuka, just don't talk until I say so, dammit!! If you're%Nsaying all of this, then why don't you try nearly%Ndrowning!?」%K%P

0x648
Yuka「WH... WHAAAAAAT!!!!?」%K%P

0x654
Yuka hysterically shouts at Saki.%K%N

0x660
Man, she's a loud screamer.%K%P

0x66C
She must be the quite the neighborhood nuisance in the%Nmiddle of the night.%K%N

0x678
Well, I don't know if she does this often, so I can't say for%Ncertain...%K%P

0x694
Izumi「There, there...」%K%P

0x6DC
Kurumi「Then how about if it's like this? Tomorrow's not April 2nd,%Nit's April 3rd!」%K%P

0x6E8
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x704
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x710
Our eyes widen at Kurumi's incomprehensible statement.%K%P

0x72C
Saki「Hey, Kurumi-chan, you do know that April 2nd comes%Nafter April 1st, right?」%K%P

0x748
Izumi「...K-Kurumi. ... Do I have to send you back to kindergarten?」%K%P

0x754
Izumi-san looks seriously worried.%K%P

0x768
Kurumi「Geez〜! That's not what Kurumi's saying, guys! ... What%Nshe wants to say is...」%K%P

0x784
Haruka「I understand... you're saying we'll decide to just skip%NApril 2nd...」%K%P

0x798
Kurumi「Right, right♪ Impressive, Haruka-san. You understand〜♪」%K%P

0x7A4
Kurumi snaps her fingers, excited that someone gets%Nher.%K%P

0x7B0
However, Haruka is as stoic as ever...%K%P

0x7CC
Yuka「Oh, I see...」%K%P

0x7E8
Saki「I get it〜. Good thinking, Kurumi-chan〜♪」%K%P

0x7FC
Kurumi「Eheheh♪ In other words, this is what we'll do! We'll have%NOkkun forget this 'April 2nd'♪」%K%P

0x810
I see...%K%P

0x81C
When Okuhiko wakes up in the morning, he'll find that the%Ndate has jumped to the third day of the camp.%K%P

0x828
He'll wonder where his memories of the second day%Nwent... Something like that.%K%P

0x834
He's the kind of guy who'll think that he drank too much,%Nblacked out, and when he regained consciousness, it%Nwas morning. That'll be the story.%K%P

0x874
Izumi「Then tomorrow will be April 3rd... Everyone good with that?」%K%P

0x880
We all nod in unison.%K%P

0x89C
Yuka「Then does everyone understand the plan for the 3rd?」%K%P

0x8B0
Haruka「Yes... In the morning, Makoto and I will go fishing.」%K%P

0x8BC
Yuka「Right, right... Then Kurumi and I will play tennis...」%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka「... Wait, Kurumi-chan's going back, so how will I play%Ntennis!?」%K%P

0x8EC
Saki「Okuhiko-kun and I played together that day as well,%Nright?」%K%P

0x8F8
Yes... she's right.%K%P

0x90C
Yuka「... Yeah. But won't we have an odd number of people? We%Nwon't be able to play doubles like we did last time.」%K%P

0x918
Saki「Well, we'll just have to 'change history' at that point...」%K%P

0x934
Izumi「After that...?」%K%P

0x948
Haruka「... At the terrace... Okuhiko will rudely approach me...」%K%P

0x954
Makoto「I'll run to the terrace once I hear him. Then he'll hit me...」%K%P

0x970
Yuka「At that time, Saki will hear their conversation... Are you%Nokay with acting violent again, Saki?」%K%P

0x98C
Saki「What do you mean, acting violently? ... Don't worry, leave%Nthat area to me.」%K%P

0x998
... If it's Saki, then I feel that she'll be able to just act as%Nshe did before with no issues...%K%P

0x9AC
Saki「Haruka-chan... I'll have to say those bad things to you%Nagain... I'm sorry.」%K%P

0x9C0
Haruka「It's fine... I'm used to it, so...」%K%P

0x9CC
It seems those two made peace with each other when I%Nwasn't looking.%K%P

0x9E8
Izumi「Then it should be all right if I arrive at the lodge a little%Nbefore 7:00 and make dinner.」%K%P

0x9FC
Kurumi「After that... you'll all go to the Test of Courage and the%Nhot springs♪」%K%P

0xA08
Izumi「Right. That covers the general outline.」%K%P

0xA14
Makoto「Well then, this concludes the strategy meeting...」%K%P

0xA20
Kurumi「Everyone, since Kurumi won't be there tomorrow, good%Nluck with your parts♪」%K%P

0xA34
As they rise from their seats, everyone returns Kurumi's%Nsmile.%K%P

0xA78
But I want to talk with Izumi-san a little more.%K%P

0xA84
I still haven't told her how I feel...%K%P

0xA90
Makoto「Izumi-san... Umm... err...」%K%P

0xAA4
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xAB0
Makoto「The truth is, I want to talk to you...」%K%P

0xACC
Kurumi「Geez〜... You can just talk to Onee-chan tomorrow, right?」%K%P

0xAE0
Kurumi「More importantly, talk with Kurumi. She doesn't have to%Nleave until tomorrow morning. Okay, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0xAEC
Makoto「Ah... no... um...」%K%P

0xAF8
I instinctively mumble.%K%P

0xB04
The only one I want to talk to right now is Izumi-san.%K%P

0xB18
Izumi「You can't, Kurumi. It's past 11:00. You have to wake up%Nearly tomorrow, so go to sleep.」%K%P

0xB2C
Kurumi「Boo〜!」%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0xB4C
Izumi「I'm very sorry... I'm going to sleep too, so can this wait%Nuntil tomorrow?」%K%P

0xB58
Makoto「Huh? N-No, um...」%K%P

0xB64
This is troublesome.%K%N

0xB70
I don't know if I'll get a chance to talk to her or not%Ntomorrow...%K%P

0xB7C
I want to tell her my feelings right away...%K%P

0xB98
Saki「Makoto-kun, staying up late is the greatest enemy to%Nthe beauty of one's form.」%K%P

0xBAC
Yuka「That's right. Just give up for today and try it tomorrow.」%K%P

0xBB8
There is no way for me to counter the assault of the four%Ngirls.%K%P

0xBC4
I don't want to risk angering them. As they say... "Hell%Nhath no fury like a woman's scorn."%K%P

0xBD0
As long as they're talking, I have no chance of%Nsucceeding.%K%P

0xC08
(Izumi-san... I... I...!!)%K%P

0xC14
I return to the lodge discouraged, those words futilly%Nechoing in my mind...%K%P
