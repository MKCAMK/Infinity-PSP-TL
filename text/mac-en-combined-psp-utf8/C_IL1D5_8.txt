Night is drawing near.%K%P

0x4C
The darkness gradually creeps up on me without warning.%K%P

0x58
Right now, I'm sitting against the wall of the lighthouse.%K%P

0x64
I feel the cold sensation of the lighthouse against my%Nback...%K%P

0x70
A hot, throbbing pain runs through the soles of my feet.%K%P

0x7C
Still, I don't feel like moving.%K%P

0x88
(What should I do from now on...?)%K%P

0x94
(Just what is going to happen...?)%K%P

0xA0
Even now, my mind is lost in confusion.%K%P

0xAC
Haruka「What are you doing in a place like this?」%K%P

0xDC
I lift my face, and see Haruka standing before me.%K%P

0xE8
Haruka「Did something happen?」%K%P

0xF4
Makoto「... Why do you think that?」%K%P

0x100
Haruka「Because... your face is pale...」%K%P

0x10C
Makoto「Really...?」%K%P

0x118
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x124
Makoto「Well... a lot of things happened.」%K%P

0x130
Haruka「A lot of things?」%K%P

0x13C
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x150
Haruka knits her eyebrows together at my answer.%K%P

0x15C
Haruka「Makoto?」%K%P

0x168
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x174
Haruka「Wouldn't it be best if you didn't think too much about it?」%K%P

0x180
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x18C
Haruka「No matter how much you think, you can only deal with%Neverything when you're at that point...」%K%P

0x198
Haruka「If it's already happened, then nobody can change it. If%Nit's something that will happen in the future, then no one%Nwill know what it is... right?」%K%P

0x1A4
I was unable to hide my unrest.%K%P

0x1B0
It's like she can read my mind without trouble...%K%P

0x1C4
Haruka「People tend to regret events that happened in the%Npast, thinking they should have done this instead of%Nthat...」%K%P

0x1D0
Haruka「But don't you think it's meaningless to worry about that?」%K%P

0x1DC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1E8
Haruka「The future is the same...」%K%P

0x1F4
Haruka「It's really trifling and insignificant to be happy when you%Nfeel something good is going to happen, or to get%Nscared when you feel something bad is going to%Nhappen...」%K%P

0x200
Haruka「I think that doing that is useless.」%K%P

0x20C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x220
Haruka「Isn't it best if you just focus on the present, on the%Nreality you're living in right now at this very instant?」%K%P

0x22C
Haruka「After all, the past is behind us and the future is%Nuncertain, right?」%K%P

0x240
Haruka「That's all...」%K%P

0x24C
After saying this, Haruka closes her mouth.%K%P

0x258
But she doesn't need to say any more for me to%Nunderstand.%K%P

0x264
Makoto「Thank you... Haruka.」%K%P

0x270
I stand up.%K%P

0x27C
In the darkness, a single strand of light begins to shine.%K%P

0x288
I don't know why Haruka said all of that.%K%P

0x294
Perhaps she thought I must've been worrying about%Nsomething insignificant when she saw my concerned%Nexpression.%K%P

0x2A0
But to me, those words have become salvation.%K%P

0x2AC
—What must I do now?%K%P

0x2B8
Thanks to Haruka, I've finally been able to find the%Nanswer to that.%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「Thank you...」%K%P

0x2D0
I thank her once more.%K%P

0x2E4
Haruka seems to be a little embarrassed, as she averts%Nher gaze to the side.%K%P

0x308
I can see the iron fence over Haruka's shoulder.%K%P

0x314
Several thin iron pipes have been bent terribly, while%Nothers on the seaward side have fallen into the ocean.%K%P

0x33C
I look beyond that side, at the wide ocean...%K%P

0x348
The sound of the blowing sea breeze reaches my ears...%K%P

0x3AC
I split up from Haruka at Viewpoint Park, and head to%NLunabeach.%K%P

0x3B8
What is it that I have to do now?%K%P

0x3C4
When I think about it, it's simple.%K%P

0x3D0
—I have to be by Izumi-san's side.%K%P

0x3DC
It has nothing to do with the premonition I had or%Nanything like that.%K%N

0x3E8
The past and the future don't matter.%K%P

0x3F4
I just want to be by Izumi-san's side.%K%P

0x400
Right now, at this very instant, I want nothing more than%Nto spend time together with Izumi-san.%K%P

0x454
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x460
I open the door and call out to her in my usual voice.%K%P

0x46C
But Izumi-san...%K%P

0x49C
Izumi「Ah...」%K%P

0x4B0
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x4BC
... still has that same depressed expression she had at%Nnoon; the expression of one thinking deeply.%K%P

0x4C8
(Is she still thinking... about the card game...?)%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x4E0
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「Can I help you out?」%K%P

0x4F8
Izumi「Help... out?」%K%P

0x504
Makoto「I'll do whatever you ask, like washing the plates or%Ncleaning up.」%K%P

0x518
Izumi「But... that's all been done.」%K%P

0x524
Izumi「Today... I closed the shop earlier than usual.」%K%P

0x530
Makoto「I see... so you're all done...」%K%P

0x544
Izumi「Oh...」%K%P

0x550
Izumi「But there is one thing I'd like your help with...」%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「Huh? What is it?」%K%P

0x568
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x57C
Izumi「... You know what?」%K%P

0x5D8
The surrounding area has been completely enveloped in%Ndarkness.%K%P

0x5E4
Since the sun hasn't been out once today, it's a little%Nchilly when I sit down on the terrace.%K%P

0x5F0
A now empty plate is on the table in front of me, only a%Nfew stains from food left behind on it.%K%P

0x5FC
Right, the thing Izumi-san said she "wanted help with"%Nwas "eating her cooking".%K%P

0x608
After the shop closed, Kurumi left saying she was "going%Nover to visit the lodge", without eating the food%NIzumi-san made for her, so Izumi-san ended up with too%Nmuch.%K%P

0x61C
Kurumi「Kurumi and Yuka-san are having fun talking, actually...」%K%P

0x628
Kurumi「... So Kurumi will stay over here tonight, okay?」%K%P

0x63C
Kurumi said that over the phone.%K%P

0x648
Well, in this case, it's left me quite happy.%K%P

0x654
Because it means that I get to eat the%Nbouillabaisse-style fish stew Izumi-san cooked...%K%P

0x660
And besides...%K%N

0x66C
Kurumi won't be coming back here...%K%P

0x678
Which means...%K%N

0x684
Izumi-san and I will be here all alone the whole time...%K%P

0x698
Izumi「Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x6A4
Makoto「Yes?」%K%P

0x6C8
Izumi「U... Umm...」%K%P

0x6D4
Her expression only shows concern.%K%P

0x6E0
For all this time, ever since that incident, Izumi-san's had%Na dark, depressed look on her face.%K%P

0x6EC
Makoto「What is it?」%K%P

0x6F8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x704
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x710
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x71C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x74C
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x758
She sounds grave, as if it she's speaking straight from%Nher heart.%K%P

0x764
Izumi「Stay calm and listen to me.」%K%P

0x770
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x77C
Izumi「I... Ever since then... I've been thinking about it...」%K%P

0x788
Makoto「... 'Then'?」%K%P

0x794
Izumi「Yes that's right... All this time... since the card game...」%K%P

0x7A0
Izumi「And then... I thought of it.」%K%P

0x7AC
Izumi「Somehow... I feel that I understand it.」%K%P

0x7B8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x7C4
Izumi「The premonitions...」%K%P

0x7D0
Makoto「What...?」%K%P

0x7DC
Izumi「Makoto-kun, your premonitions...」%K%P

0x7E8
Izumi「Are surely-」%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「W-Wait a minute!」%K%P

0x808
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x814
Makoto「Izumi-san, that's enough of that.」%K%P

0x820
Izumi「'That's enough'...?」%K%P

0x82C
Makoto「I've had enough of these premonitions.」%K%P

0x838
Makoto「I've decided not to worry about them and stop believing%Nthem.」%K%P

0x84C
Izumi「... What?」%K%P

0x858
Makoto「I'm done thinking about foolish things like premonitions.」%K%P

0x864
Makoto「No one knows the future...」%K%P

0x870
Makoto「Even if I received a hundred correct premonitions up%Nuntil now, there's no telling if the next one will actually be%Ncorrect...」%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「... Isn't that right?」%K%P

0x888
Makoto「What's important is now, the very moment before our%Neyes...」%K%P

0x894
At this very moment...%K%N

0x8A0
... I'm with Izumi-san.%K%P

0x8B4
Izumi「You're wrong, Makoto-kun! That's not what I-」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「I said that's enough!」%K%P

0x8CC
Makoto「Those things have nothing to do with me anymore!」%K%P

0x8E0
Izumi「But-」%K%P

0x8EC
Makoto「I'm serious!」%K%P

0x8F8
Makoto「I'm serious, Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x904
Makoto「... Please... stop it...」%K%P

0x910
Makoto「Stop talking... about premonitions...」%K%P

0x91C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x94C
... ... ...%K%P

0x958
The silence continues.%K%P

0x964
Izumi-san hangs her head downwards, apparently still%Nworrying about something.%K%P

0x970
Izumi-san's expression causes my chest to tighten.%K%P

0x97C
Makoto「Come on, let's talk about something else!」%K%P

0x988
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x994
Makoto「Let's talk about something interesting!」%K%P

0x9A0
Makoto「Like... for example...」%K%P

0x9AC
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x9B8
Makoto「Oh, I know! How about we talk about stars?」%K%P

0x9CC
Izumi「... Stars?」%K%P

0x9D8
Makoto「Yeah. After all, you seem to know a whole lot about stars.」%K%P

0x9E4
Makoto「Tell me the names of more stars I don't know, and stuff%Nabout Regulus and Pinnochion.」%K%P

0x9F8
Izumi「It's not 'Pinnochion'...」%K%P

0xA04
Izumi「... It's Procyon.」%K%P

0xA10
When Izumi-san says that, a faint smile appears on her%Nface.%K%P

0xA1C
When I see that expression, I become more determined,%Nand continue to talk.%K%P

0xA44
Makoto「Ah, right, right.」%K%P

0xA50
Makoto「It's Procyon, not Pinnochion.」%K%P

0xA5C
Makoto「Well, either one's fine...」%K%P

0xA68
Makoto「No, that's no good... that's no good at all. Definitely not.」%K%P

0xA74
Makoto「Procyon, Procyon, Procyon... There, I've memorized it!」%K%P

0xA80
Makoto「So, about Pinnochion-」%K%P

0xA94
Izumi「Procyon!」%K%P

0xAA0
Izumi-san smiles.%K%N

0xAAC
Her kind smile is back.%K%P

0xAB8
Izumi「... All right.」%K%P

0xAC4
Izumi「Then, shall we talk...」%K%P

0xAD8
Izumi「... About stars?」%K%P

0xAE4
I smile widely in reply.%K%P

0xAF0
Makoto「Yeah!」%K%P

0xAFC
I nod my head energetically, like a child...%K%P
