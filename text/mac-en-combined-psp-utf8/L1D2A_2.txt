Haruka's words make me kind of uneasy.%K%P

0x2C
It's not rare for people to have headaches.%K%P

0x38
Normally, I think I'd probably be able to just shrug off%NHaruka's concern.%K%P

0x44
However...%K%P

0x50
I suddenly remember the "bell" I found on the beach last%Nnight.%K%P

0x5C
—What if that dream really was a premonition?%K%P

0x68
—And what if that the girl in that dream was Kurumi?%K%P

0x74
I violently shake my head in order to drive these%Nunpleasant delusions away.%K%P

0x80
(I'm probably overthinking this because I'm a little%Nnervous.)%K%P

0x8C
(It was only one or two nightmares...)%K%P

0x98
These thoughts still don't make me any less worried.%K%P

0xA4
If I go to the pool in this state, I won't be able to stop%Nthinking about this and have fun.%K%P

0xB0
Makoto「All right, I've got it!」%K%P

0xBC
My mind is already set.%K%P

0xC8
Makoto「I'll go back and check up on Kurumi once more.」%K%P

0xD4
Haruka silently looks into my eyes.%K%P

0xE0
Makoto「Then if she seems okay, I'll also head to the pool%Nafterwards.」%K%P

0xEC
Haruka「I'll...」%K%P

0xF8
Haruka「I'll go with you too.」%K%P

0x104
Makoto「No, I'll be fine without you. Just go with the others to the%Npool.」%K%P

0x110
Makoto「Kurumi might not like it if there's too many of us.」%K%P

0x11C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x128
For a moment, Haruka seems to be silently pondering my%Nwords...%K%P

0x134
Haruka「All right, I understand.」%K%P

0x140
... Before long, she answers, and quietly lets go of my%Nwrist.%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「Well then, I'm going. Will you explain this to the others for%Nme?」%K%P

0x158
Haruka「... Y-Yes.」%K%P

0x188
I give Haruka a reassuring nod, and start going back the%Nway I came.%K%N

0x194
As I take several steps, I hear Yuka's voice from far%Naway.%K%P

0x1A0
I can't make out what she's saying.%K%P

0x1AC
I guess I should respond..%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「Go ahead without me!」%K%P

0x1C4
... I shout at the top of my lungs, but I don't think anyone%Ncould hear me despite my volume.%K%P

0x1D0
The thundering roar of the monstrous ocean drowns out%Nmy voice.%K%P

0x23C
I return to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x248
I take a roundabout path from the direction of Moon%NBeach to go to the restaurant.%K%P

0x254
Well, I was "thinking" of trying that, but just as I approach%Nthe establishment...%K%P

0x2B8
The door opens, and someone from inside comes out.%K%P

0x2D4
(Kurumi...!?)%K%P

0x308
Before I can call out to her, Kurumi runs out onto the%Npaved road, and turns west.%K%P

0x314
It's almost as if she's chasing after a fugitive or%Nsomething.%K%P

0x320
Of course, Kurumi doesn't notice me standing by the wall%Nof the shop.%K%P

0x33C
I stare at Kurumi with astonishment.%K%P

0x348
(Kurumi... even though she said... that she had a%Nheadache...)%K

0xC30
Go to the pool.

0xC3C
Go follow Kurumi.

0x388
Well, it looks like she's feeling better, so there's no need%Nto worry.%K%P

0x394
I should go to the pool now.%K%P

0x3A0
I chase after the others, who are way ahead of me...%K%P

0x3EC
I instantly chase after Kurumi...%K%P

0x444
The distance between me and Kurumi is almost 110 yards.%N

0x450
If I shout, she might be able to hear me.%K%P

0x45C
But... I don't try to.%K%P

0x468
(If she's able to run this fast, then she probably lied%Nabout having a headache...)%K%P

0x474
(Then... What was her real reason for not wanting to go to%Nthe pool that would make her stoop to lying?)%K%P

0x480
I don't know, but for now, there's no doubting the fact%Nthat Kurumi has a secret that she's not telling us.%K%P

0x48C
I won't be able to discover her secret if I try talking to%Nher now...%K%P

0x498
(This doesn't feel very good...)%K%P

0x4A4
(I know I shouldn't just go peeking at people's secrets...)%K%P

0x4B0
Still, my curiosity is getting the better of me...%K%N

0x4BC
... Before long, Kurumi slows down to a walking pace.%K%P

0x4C8
Of course she's exhausted; she's been running%Nnon-stop since leaving Lunabeach.%K%P

0x4D4
Even though I have more stamina, I also can't help but%Npant...%K%P

0x4E0
Like this, I'm able to maintain a fixed distance between%Nme and Kurumi, so I continue to tail her.%K%N

0x4EC
I feel like a petty detective...%K%P

0x4F8
... Without warning, Kurumi suddenly turns left onto a side%Nstreet and disappears.%K%N

0x504
I lose sight of her, so I also jog over to that side road...%K%P

0x57C
I see a long row of cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0x588
(To think there'd be cherry blossoms blooming here...)%K%P

0x594
This is an unexpected surprise, but now isn't the time to%Nbe watching the cherry blossoms.%K%N

0x5A0
Because I ran to the side road, I'm too close to Kurumi.%K%N

0x5AC
She's walking underneath a nearby tree.%K%P

0x5B8
Suddenly, as if she heard my footsteps, Kurumi draws to%Na halt and starts turning.%K%P

0x5C4
Before she can turn around, I quickly hide behind a%Nnearby tree...%K%N

0x5D0
While hiding behind the back of the trunk of the tree...%K%P

0x5DC
(Should I really be doing this?)%K%P

0x5E8
... I ponder this.%K%N

0x5F4
But I've come this far already. I can't go back now.%K%P

0x600
...???%K%N

0x60C
Well... it's not that I can't go back, but I really want to%Nfigure out what's Kurumi's secret.%K%P

0x618
Drawing strength from my newfound determination, I%Nresume the pursuit...%K%P

0x690
Past the cherry blossom trees, I come across a park%Nwith a great view.%K%N

0x69C
At the entrance of the park is a sign with the words,%N"Viewpoint Park" written on it.%K%P

0x6A8
Right now, Kurumi is leaning on one of the handrails on%Nthe side of the park...%K%P

0x724
... and gazing out beyond the vast ocean.%K%N

0x730
For some reason, looking at that lonely figure of hers is%Nmaking me feel a sharp pain in my heart.%K%N

0x73C
The sea breeze rustles her hair...%K%P

0x748
Her large eyes become transparent as the blue sea is%Nreflected off of them.%K%P

0x754
What could Kurumi be looking at beyond the silvery sea?%K%P

0x760
The spring sky before me looks like it's happily%Nembracing the world...%K%N

0x76C
The endless azure sea looks like it goes on out forever...%K%P

0x778
Kurumi stands alone in that magnificent scenery, looking%Nvery small, frail, and transient.%K%P

0x784
I want to run up to her from behind and embrace her%Ntightly to take away all of her sorrow.%K%P

0x790
(Is this... Kurumi's... secret?)%K%P

0x79C
(What reason did she have that made her lie to us so%Nshe could come here?)%K%P

0x7A8
There's no way I can call out to her.%K%N

0x7B4
Is it possible that I saw something that I shouldn't have%Nseen?%K%P

0x7C0
That the normally cheerful girl has secret feelings deep%Ndown that she won't tell anyone...%K%P

0x7DC
Kurumi「Ah...!」%K%P

0x7E8
Kurumi「Why...? You definitely went to the pool, didn't you...?」%K%P

0x7F4
When I wasn't paying attention, Kurumi had turned around.%K%P

0x800
I was absolutely dumbfounded by seeing Kurumi looking%Nthe way she was that before I knew it, I was standing still,%Nstaring at her.%K%P

0x80C
I completely forgot to hide myself.%K%P

0x818
Makoto「N-No... I was a little worried, so...」%K%P

0x824
Makoto「So I tried going back to Lunabeach... but because you%Nweren't there...」%K%P

0x830
I'm lying, since saying something like, "The truth is, I%Nsecretly followed you here," wouldn't exactly be a smart%Nthing to say in this situation.%K%P

0x83C
Kurumi「So you came here looking?」%K%P

0x848
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x854
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x860
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x86C
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x878
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x884
An awkward silence hangs around in the air...%K%P

0x890
However...%K%P

0x8B4
Kurumi「Geez♪ You didn't even need to worry at all♪」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x8CC
Kurumi「Because that was a lie♪」%K%P

0x8D8
Makoto「A lie?」%K%P

0x8E4
Kurumi「Kurumi lied about having a headache.」%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x920
Kurumi「The truth is... Kurumi was a little embarrassed...」%K%P

0x92C
Kurumi「But keep this a secret, okay?」%K%P

0x938
Makoto「... S-Sorry. I don't really understand what you're saying...」%K%P

0x944
Kurumi「... T-That's... Kurumi can't say it.」%K%P

0x950
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x95C
Kurumi「... She was too embarrassed to wear a swimsuit!」%K%P

0x968
Kurumi「Because, everyone's... everyone's... are big...」%K%P

0x974
Makoto「Big... what do you mean?」%K%P

0x980
Kurumi「Their breasts.」%K%P

0x98C
Makoto「Breasts?」%K%P

0x998
Kurumi「Only Kurumi's are like a kid's, so...」%K%P

0x9A4
Makoto「Could it be that you're actually worried about your%Nfigure?」%K%P

0x9B8
Kurumi「Geez!! Don't say it so bluntly!」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「Hahahahaha!」%K%P

0x9D0
Kurumi「Don't laugh!!」%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「There's no reason for you to worry about that at all,%Nright?.」%K%P

0x9E8
Kurumi「???」%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「After all, it's not just you, right? I think that Haruka's%Nprobably flat herself, don't you think?」%K%P

0xA00
Kurumi「Don't say flat!」%K%P

0xA0C
Kurumi「Kurumi does have some breasts!」%K%P

0xA18
Makoto「Hey, hey! That's different from what you said earlier...」%K%P

0xA24
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xA30
Makoto「... Well, anyway, I don't think it's something you should%Nworry about.」%K%P

0xA44
Kurumi「Even though you said 'flat' just now...」%K%P

0xA50
Makoto「But in your case, even if you are flat, I don't think there's%Nanything to criticize about your figure because you%Nhave long legs.」%K%P

0xA5C
Kurumi「So you really do think Kurumi's flat...」%K%P

0xA68
Makoto「And besides, what about in the future? Your breasts are%Ngoing to get big...」%K%P

0xA74
Makoto「In the future, your breasts are definitely going to get%Nbigger and bigger!」%K%P

0xA88
Kurumi「You think so?」%K%P

0xA94
Makoto「That's right. So there's nothing to worry about!」%K%P

0xAA0
Kurumi tilts her head, acting like she's thinking about%Nsomething...%K%P

0xAAC
Kurumi「All right, got it.」%K%P

0xAB8
... And mutters this.%K%P

0xAC4
Kurumi「Kurumi knows she said it earlier, but could you keep this%Na secret from everyone?」%K%P

0xAD0
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0xADC
I smile while giving her a deep nod.%K%P

0xAE8
Makoto「All right then, how about we go back?」%K%P

0xAF4
I start to walk as Kurumi trots over to my side.%K%P

0xB00
I glance at Kurumi's face from the side.%K%P

0xB0C
All traces of loneliness in her expression seem to have%Ndisappeared.%K%P
