After we finish eating our sandwiches for breakfast,%NMakoto and I walk by the morning coastline.%K%P

0x140
When I suddenly look up, I see the very picture of a wide,%Nblue sky...%K%P

0x14C
The springtime haze is hanging in the air all across the%Nsea,%K%P

0x158
making a yacht traveling across the water seem like an%Nillusion as it creates whitecaps...%K%P

0x164
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Aren't we going to see the cherry blossoms%Nagain?」%K%P

0x170
Makoto asks this with a puzzled face.%K%P

0x17C
It's true that on the last 4th, we went to see them... and%Nwe went for a second time the day before yesterday.%K%P

0x190
Yuka「No. We're not going today.」%K%P

0x19C
Yuka「Why don't we go to Lunabeach to relax and pass the%Ntime instead?」%K%P

0x1A8
Makoto「Yeah, good idea. We have to meet with everyone at%NLunabeach at 5:00 anyway...」%K%P

0x1BC
Yuka「Besides... looking at those cherry blossoms just makes%Nme remember him.」%K%P

0x1C8
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x1E4
Yuka「The first boy that I loved.」%K%P

0x1F8
I steal a glance at Makoto's face.%K%P

0x204
His expression is a jumble of bewilderment and irritation...%K%P

0x210
"But I think that Makoto-kun definitely loves you too."%K%P

0x21C
Izumi-san's words from last night repeat themselves in%Nmy mind.%K%P

0x228
Makoto... also loves me...?%K%P

0x234
My heart starts beating furiously.%K%P

0x240
(I've become conscious of him now because she said%Nthat...)%K%P

0x24C
As if terrified that he can hear the noise in my heart, I%Nplace my hands over my chest.%K%P

0x258
...%K%P

0x264
Suddenly, I notice that Makoto's expression has%Nreturned to normal.%K%P

0x270
He's cheerfully whistling.%K%P

0x27C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x288
(So... it's not like that after all...)%K%P

0x294
In the first place, I'm not even certain if I really love him or%Nnot...%K%P

0x308
As usual, Lunabeach has no customers...%K%P

0x314
We make trivial conversation with Izumi-san while slurping%Ndown coffee.%K%P

0x320
...Before long, Izumi-san slyly steers the conversation to%Na certain topic.%K%P

0x334
Izumi「Oh... you don't know what 'Laplace' is?」%K%P

0x340
Izumi「It refers to 'Laplace's Demon'.」%K%P

0x34C
Izumi「These are the words of a French mathematician and%Nastronomer named Laplace.」%K%P

0x358
Izumi「'Suppose there exists a "demon," that is, an entity that%Npossesses the ability to know, at a certain moment, the%Nstate of all things in the universe...」%K%P

0x364
Izumi「...Then, no matter how brief this moment is, it would always%Nbe enough for the demon to unravel everything that%Nhappened in the past and will happen in the future.'」%K%P

0x370
Izumi「In short, what that man was saying was this. Everything%Nwhich occurs in the world has been predetermined from%Nthe beginning.'」%K%P

0x37C
Izumi「No matter how big or how small an event is...」%K%P

0x388
Izumi「...Its occurrence is by no means accidental, but in fact%Ninevitable... That's what it means.」%K%P

0x394
Izumi「I believe that in philosophy, this is called causal%Ndeterminism'.」%K%P

0x3A8
"'Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning. Its occurrence is by%Nno means accidental, but in fact inevitable'."%K%P

0x3B4
Everything's... been decided...?%K%P

0x3C0
I don't like those words...%K%P

0x3CC
It's like when I talked about time paradoxes with Makoto%Non the night of the 2nd...%K%P

0x3D8
... ... ...%K%P

0x3E4
...Before long, due to unusual circumstances, it ends up%Nbeing arranged so that I'll be working at Lunabeach for%None week during our summer break.%K%P

0x3F0
Even I don't know why I ended up agreeing to do%Nsomething like that.%K%P

0x3FC
Perhaps... I might have wanted to have an objective for%Nthe near future...%K%P

0x480
After lunch, we go to the shopping district.%K%P

0x48C
We're responsible for helping out with the barbecue.%K%P

0x498
The things that we have to buy are large quantities of%N"beef, green peppers, onions, oil, and beer".%K%P

0x4A4
However, the car isn't working and the bike broke the%Nother day.%K%P

0x4B0
That means we have no choice but to walk in order to%Ntake care of our errands.%K%P

0x4BC
...An hour or so later, we are carrying full shopping bags%Nin both our hands.%K%P

0x4D0
Yuka「Whew... we didn't forget anything, did we?」%K%P

0x4DC
Makoto「N-No... probably not.」%K%P

0x4E8
Makoto「But... don't you think this is too much beer?" Haruka and%NKurumi can't even drink it.」%K%P

0x4FC
Yuka「This isn't a lot at all...」%K%P

0x508
Makoto「A-Are you kidding me!? We bought eight cases of%Nsix-pack beer!!」%K%P

0x514
Makoto「Dammit, all it does is act as extra weight...!」%K%P

0x520
Makoto slouches and drags the bags, looking like he%Ncan't take another step forward.%K%P

0x534
Yuka「Well then, shall we go back?」%K%P

0x548
Even though I say this calmly, I trudge along, full of%Nirritation.%K%P

0x554
(What the hell!? You didn't complain when you had to%Ncarry the rice and Saki on your back last time!!)%K%P

0x560
...As I continue to walk, I scream this in my mind...%K%P

0x574
...In the end, we decide to bring Makoto's bags back by%Nborrowing a push car from one of the nearby shops.%K%P

0x5A0
Lunabeach is already before our eyes.%K%P

0x5AC
Makoto「Ah, I just remembered something...」%K%P

0x5C0
Yuka「Huh!? What is it!? Did we forget to buy something?」%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「No, that's not it... It's about last night...」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「Yuka, didn't you have some business with me?」%K%P

0x5EC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x5F8
Makoto「You were looking at me with a serious expression back%Nthen, weren't you?」%K%P

0x604
Yuka「...Hmm, was I really?」%K%P

0x610
Makoto「After that, the two of us didn't get a chance to talk%Nalone, because after the Test of Courage, I went to%Nsleep right away...」%K%P

0x61C
(The Test ...of Courage...)%K%P

0x628
Makoto「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x634
Makoto「You don't have to restrain yourself. Your problems are%Nmy problems, after all.」%K%P

0x640
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「Ah, no... that's not what I meant...」%K%P

0x658
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「Wh-What I meant was that there's no point to us working%Ntogether if we can't share those kinds of problems... but...」%K%P

0x678
Yuka「Hmm? ...What?」%K%P

0x684
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x690
Makoto「...If you don't want me to ask , that's fine...」%K%P

0x69C
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「More importantly-」%K%P

0x6B4
Yuka「Oh, about yesterday?」%K%P

0x6C0
Yuka「That really was nothing...」%K%P

0x6CC
Yuka「It's just that when I saw you eating, I kinda lost my%Nappetite...」%K%P

0x6D8
Makoto「...What do you mean?」%K%P

0x6EC
Yuka「Nothing really.」%K%P

0x6F8
Makoto「If there's something you want to say, then just say it flat%Nout.」%K%P

0x70C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x73C
Yuka「Then I'll say it...!」%K%P

0x748
Makoto「Wh-What...?」%K%P

0x754
Yuka「At the Test of Courage yesterday...」%K%P

0x760
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x774
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x780
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x78C
Yuka「I saw a severed head...」%K%P

0x798
Makoto「...I know.」%K%P

0x7C8
Yuka「Wh-Why!?」%K%P

0x7D4
Makoto「...Haah.」%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka「Why do you know that!?」%K%P

0x7EC
Yuka「S-So that really... was an actual severed head...」%K%P

0x7F8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x80C
...That was rather pathetic of me, if I do say so myself.%K%P

0x818
The thing I was really scared of...%K Was for him to ask me to%Ntell him the truth...%K%P

0x8FC
...The barbecue has begun.%K%P

0x908
Everyone is holding a paper cup in their hands.%K%P

0x914
Inside the cups are ice cold beer (but Kurumi and Haruka%Nhave orange juice).%K%P

0x920
Savory smoke begins to rise from the iron plate in the%Nmiddle.%K%P

0x92C
Everyone is more cheerful than last time.%K%P

0x938
...%K%P

0x97C
Saki「Izumi-san, isn't the meat on this side just about ready to%Nbe eaten?」%K%P

0x988
Izumi「Huh? Maybe, but I think it'd be best to let it cook longer.」%K%P

0x994
Saki「If you do that, it'll get burnt!」%K%P

0x9A0
Izumi「But no matter how you look at it, the meat you have is%Nrare, isn't it?」%K%P

0x9AC
...%K%P

0x9F4
Haruka「...Crabs.」%K%P

0xA00
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xA0C
Haruka「Look, over there... There's crabs over there, right?」%K%P

0xA18
Kurumi「Wow, you're right♪ Look, Okkun. There's crabs right over%Nthere.」%K%P

0xA24
Kurumi「Do they do crab wrestling here? Is this Sumo Crab's%Ntraining grounds?」%K%P

0xA30
Saki「You people are so damn innocent...」%K%P

0xA3C
Haruka「Saki... your meat is rare...」%K%P

0xA48
...%K%P

0xA54
Saki's expresion shows no signs of gloom, and Haruka is%Nalso in an unusually good mood.%K%P

0xA60
That's only to be expected. This time, Saki and Haruka%Nhaven't had one single fight...%K%P

0xA6C
...%K%P

0xAA4
Izumi「By the way, Saki-chan, is that perfume you're using lilac?」%K%P

0xAB0
Saki「Oh, you noticed? It's a blend of lilac and fruit...」%K%P

0xABC
Izumi「Could it be... that you're in love with someone,%NSaki-chan〜?♪」%K%P

0xAC8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xAD4
Saki「H-Hell no! It's not like that at all...」%K%P

0xAE0
Makoto「Ah! Saki, I wanted that meat!」%K%P

0xAFC
Saki「Shut the hell up, it's mine! Besides, I don't see your name%Nwritten anywhere on it. Do you?」%K%P

0xB08
Makoto「Mmmmmmmph...」%K%P

0xB1C
Makoto「Yukaaaa, do something about her! I can't deal with rich%Ngirls〜」%K%P

0xB28
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xB34
Makoto「Yuka?」%K%P

0xB48
Yuka「...Huh? What?」%K%P

0xB54
Makoto「Why are you spacing out? Are you in a bad mood?」%K%P

0xB60
Yuka「Y-You think so? Hmm... maybe I had a bit too much to drink...」%K%P

0xB6C
Makoto「Huh? But you haven't even had a single cup yet...」%K%P

0xB80
Yuka「Not true... I remember having a drink on the way here...」%K%P

0xB94
Saki「...」%K%P

0xBA0
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0xBF0
...I go away from everyone, heading towards the rocky%Nwall.%K%P

0xBFC
Yuka「Haah...」%K%P

0xC08
No matter what I do, there's no way the current me can%Noutright join in that fooling around.%K%P

0xC14
Makoto's voice bothers me. Saki's voice bothers me.%K%NSeeing the two of them having fun just irritates me.%K%P

0xC20
(What should... I do...?)%K%P

0xC2C
At the very least, in the last loop, I never had an%Nemotional day like this.%K%P

0xC38
I was never jealous of those two.%K%P

0xC44
Could this also be the result of history changing?%K%P

0xC50
Or...%K Or... is this proof... that I love Makoto?%K%P

0xCA0
In the distance, I can hear the sound of wavelets... I hear%Nthem twice, as if they're nodding to me.%K%P

0xCAC
At that time...%K%P

0xD3C
Yuka「N-Nothing really... Sorry for worrying you... I'm just%Nsobering up...」%K%P

0xD50
Kurumi「Liar.」%K%P

0xD64
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

Kurumi「Yuka-san, you're lying.」%K%P

Yuka「Wh-Why...?」%K%P

0xDA8
Kurumi「Whenever you lie, your eyes look the other way.」%K%P

0xDBC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xDC8
Kurumi「Kurumi's deduction for the reason you're so down is...」%K%P

0xDE4
Kurumi「...because you're depressed about the kitty keychain,%Nright?」%K%P

0xDF8
Kurumi「You've been worried... that you've been gaining weight%Nrecently, right?」%K%P

0xE0C
Yuka「Huh...?」%K%P

0xE18
Kurumi「Bulls-eye, huh?」%K%P

0xE2C
Yuka「...」%K%P

Yuka「Eheh♪ I guess you got me.」%K%P

0xE54
Kurumi「As Kurumi thought...」%K%P

0xE78
Kurumi「Kurumi thought it'd be like this, so... Ta-da♪ It's KuruKuru%NKurumi Magic♪」%K%P

0xE84
She pulls a folded paper out of her pocket.%K%P

0xE98
Yuka「...What's that?」%K%P

0xEAC
Kurumi「A kitty. It's an origami kitty that Kurumi made♪」%K%P

0xEB8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xECC
Kurumi「Kurumi wanted to make a replacement for Yuka-san's%Ntreasure, so she put all her effort into making this%Nyesterday afternoon.」%K%P

Kurumi「She just forgot to give it to you then...」%K%P

The sound of the wavelets steadily grows more and%Nmore distant...%K%P

0xFB8
There's one more memory that I'd forgotten...%K%P

0xFC4
...%K%P

0xFD8
It was on the field trip in 9th grade...%K%P

0xFE4
The night the two of us gazed at that starry sky...%K%P

He finished telling me the story of Gemini...%K%P

0x11A0
"My name is..."%K%P

0x11AC

In the world with the purple sky, the crying girl... told%Nsomeone her name...%K%P

0x136C
Kurumi「Was... the kitty too much? Was Kurumi sticking her nose%Nwhere it didn't belong?」%K%P

0x1380
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x138C
Kurumi「...You don't have to push yourself to take it if you don't%Nwant it. It's fine...」%K%P

0x1458
Kurumi「Kurumi thought this would happen! Ta-da♪ It's a%NKuruKuru Kurumiracle♪」%K%P

0x1464
Kurumi-chan takes a can of beer out of her bosom.%K%P

0x1488
Kurumi「Drink this and cheer up!」%K%P

0x14A4
Kurumi「Kurumi thought she'd help out by letting you drink this!」%K%P

0x14B0
Kurumi「Oh, but don't worry. Kurumi made sure to get the ones%Nwith 'low calorie' written on them.」%K%P

0x14BC
Kurumi「It's boring when you're not drunk, after all...」%K%P

0x14C8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x14DC
Kurumi「Oh, could it be that you're surprised?」%K%P

0x14F0
Yuka「...Y-Yes.」%K%P

0x14FC
Kurumi「Brr... Kurumi kept these against her chest by putting%Nthem in her clothes, so she's cold now.」%K%P

0x1510
Kurumi「...Wait, doesn't that mean the beer is lukewarm now?」%K%P

0x1524
Yuka「...N-No. I don't really mind.」%K%P

0x1530
Kurumi「Really? What relief♪」%K%P

0x153C
I take the can of beer from Kurumi-chan.%K%P

0x1578
Fsssh! I open the lid off the the beer, and gulp the%Ncontents down my throat.%K%P

0x1584
Kurumi-chan's warmth is still there.%K%P

0x1598
Yuka「Fwaaah...!」%K%P

0x15AC
Yuka「All right! I'll just drink this down and forget about all the%Nbad things!」%K%P

0x15C0
Kurumi「Yes, yes♪ Go back to being your usual self!」%K%P

0x15D4
...Yes, I'll drink it all and forget about the bad things.%K%P

0x15E0
The lukewarm beer makes me feel a comfortable, elated%Nsensation.%K%P

0x15EC
...%K%P

0x15F8
Finally, the time comes to return to the others...%K Haruka is%Ncarrying a dirty plastic bag...%K%P

0x1604
... ... ...%K%P

0x168C
About an hour has passed since then.%K The party's in full%Nswing.%K%P

0x1698
Everything is calm as we fool around and poke fun at%Neach other... It's as noisy as ever.%K%P

0x16A4
By now, I've already had a lot of beer to drink.%K%P

0x16B0
As for how many cups I've had exactly... I've lost count.%K%P

Before long, the alcohol gets to my head, and my sense%Nof balance worsens.%K%P

0x16C8
I begin shouting the same things again and again. Of%Ncourse, my words are all messed up too.%K%P

0x16D4
The words I'm saying are also incoherent, and I get%Nangry, weepy, hysterical with laughter, and mopey...%K%P

0x16E0
Anyway, I'm hectic...%K%P

0x16EC
...%K%P

0x16F8
Suddenly, someone taps me on the shoulder.%K%P

0x1704
...It's Makoto.%K%P

0x1710
He sticks his thumb up, and points towards the rock wall.%K%P

0x171C
And then, he slowly walks to the rock wall.%K%P

0x1728
...It seems he wants to have a private conversation...%K%P

0x1734
Although I tilt my head, I still following him with tottering%Nsteps.%K%P

0x1774
Yuka「Whaa ish it, Mako-tan? Doo yuu have shum bishnesh wif%Nme?」%K%P

0x1780
Makoto「Yeah, there's something important I have to talk to you%Nabout.」%K%P

Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1798
Makoto「...W-What is it?」%K%P

0x17AC
Yuka「...Leshee... ish it a confeshun of love?」%K%P

0x17B8
Makoto「I-Idiot, there's no way it'd be that!」%K%P

0x17CC
Yuka「C'mon, Mako-tan♪ If dash it, den yuu should hurry up%Nand shay it♪」%K%P

0x17D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x17EC
Yuka「Mako-tan, the trufe ish ...eye alsho lo...」%K%P

0x1810
(—Huh?)%K%P

0x181C
...I sober up...%K%P

0x1828
Makoto is standing stock still, dumbfounded...%K%P

0x1834
(...Th-This is... no, not now...!)%K%P

0x1864
Yuka「Kyahahahahahahaha♪」%K%P

0x1870
Yuka「Dat wash a lie, a joke♪」%K%P

Yuka「Eye fought it'd be funee if eye meid a little fun of yuu♪」%K%P

0x1888
Yuka「Yer sho cute... when yuu look troubled♪」%K%P

0x1894

0x18A0
I decide to pretend to be drunk.%K%P

0x18B4
Yuka「Sho? Whash dat shumfing important yuu wanted to talk%Nabaut?」%K%P

0x18C0
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0x18CC
Makoto「Okay, listen to me carefully, and not a word out of you%Nuntil I'm done, got it?」%K%P

0x18D8
I nod like an insolent child.%K%P

0x1940
...Makoto's story concerns Kurumi-chan.%K%N

0x194C
In the last history, Kurumi-chan went missing this night.%K%N

0x1958
We went looking for Kurumi-chan, and went to the shrine,%Nwhere we found her.%K%N

0x1964
In that shrine, we saw that talisman, which was the trigger%Nto our start of this infinite loop.%K%N

0x1970
In other words, in order to make sure we don't repeat the%Nsame history, we can't let Kurumi-chan go to the shrine.%K%P

0x1984
What he's saying is that Kurumi-chan's disappearance%Nitself is a "bad event".%K%N%N

0x1990
In order to prevent that incident from happening, Makoto%Nwants to watch over Kurumi-chan for the entire night...%K%N%N

0x199C
...That's his plan.%K%P

0x19F4
Yuka「Eye shee. So dash it...」%K%P

0x1A00
Makoto「You'll help me, right?」%K%P

0x1A0C
Yuka「Of coursh!」%K%P

0x1A18
Makoto「...Hey, did you really understand a word of what I said%Njust now...?」%K%P

0x1A24
Yuka「Geesh, ish faine!」%K%P

0x1A38
Yuka「Jusht leef it to meee! Nahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x1A44
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1A58
Makoto shrugs his shoulders.%K%P

0x1A64
He might be thinking "I should've waited until she%Nsobered up."%K%P

0x1A80
—And, at that time!%K%P

0x1AB4
The sound of water splashing echoes!%K%P

0x1AC0
This sound... It's exactly like the one I heard at the last%Nbarbecue.%K%P

0x1ACC
I don't need to turn around to understand the situation.%K%P

0x1AD8
Saki's hand accidentally slipped, and she spilled the%Nbeer in her paper cup on me.%K%P

0x1AE4
(—Huh???)%K%P

0x1AF0
(...Me???)%K%P

0x1AFC
But I'm right here!!%K%P

0x1B08
(Which means...?)%K%P

0x1B40
I try slowly turning around...%K%P

0x1B4C
By the iron plate... Saki is holding a now empty paper cup.%K%P

0x1B58
And the beer has landed on...%K%P

0x1B6C
—Kurumi-chan!%K%P

0x1B78
Kurumi's clothes are soaked from her chest to the%Nbottom of her shirt.%K%P

0x1B84
(I see...)%K%P

0x1B90
Because I wasn't in the ring of people, the person who%Nwas next to me originally, Kurumi, was directly hit...%K%P

0x1B9C
Kurumi「H-Hey, Saki-san...」%K%P

0x1BA8
Saki「...S-Sorry.」%K%P

0x1BB4
Everyone becomes completely silent.%K%P

0x1BC0
Saki「I'm really sorry.」%K%P

0x1BCC
...She sounds genuinely apologetic, meaning every word.%K%P

0x1BD8
As a further gesture of apology, Saki begins to wipe the%Nbeer off of Kurumi's clothes with a dish cloth.%K%P

0x1BE4
Okuhiko doesn't make his stupid joke, and keeps his%Nmouth shut.%K%P

0x1BF0
Naturally, Haruka also stays put, not showing any signs%Nof agitation.%K%P

0x1BFC
Just then...%K%P

0x1C18
Izumi「Geez, Saki-chan, are you sure you're not drunk?♪」%K%P

0x1C34
Okuhiko「Ha ha, that was pretty careless of you, Saki-chan♪」%K%P

0x1C50
Haruka「Hee hee hee hee...」%K%P

0x1C6C
Saki「Ahahaha...」%K%P

0x1C88
Kurumi「Eheheheh...」%K%P

0x1C9C
Everyone「Kyahahahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x1CC4
...Everyone bursts into laughter.%K%P

0x1CD0
They cheerfully laugh at Saki's blunder, as if trying to%Npoke fun at her and brush the incident off.%K%P

0x1CDC
Of course, Kurumi's bright smile returns too.%K%P

0x1CE8
Saki sheepishly grins at all the teasing.%K%P

0x1CF4
It's as if... anything and everything's all changed.%K%P

0x1D00
The atmosphere from last time has suddenly changed to%Na harmonious atmosphere.%K%P

0x1D0C
Why...?%K I don't even have to think about it.%K%P

0x1D18
Once again, a bad event has changed into a good one.%K%P

0x1D24
However, this one is special because history has%Nchanged without us directly interfering with it.%K%P

0x1D30
We didn't think about trying to prevent the fight, but%Nthankfully, history changed for us.%K%P

0x1D3C
Could it be that even luck is on our side now?%K%P

0x1D48
When I think that, I get into a kinda giddy mood.%K%P

0x1D54
It's a little later...%K But Makoto and I began to laugh much%Nlouder than the others...%K%P

0x1D60
...After that, the laughter doesn't cease until the%Nbarbecue ends...%K%P
