"This time, I'll definitely save Saki." —I promise myself%Nthis.%K%P

0x18C
(But just where should I start from?)%K%P

0x198
I'm lost.%K%P

0x1A4
In order to save Saki, I have to get rid of her distrust of%Nhumans...%K%P

0x1B0
The problem isn't just her opposition towards Yuka%Nabout the Magician's Portrait incident from their middle%Nschool days.%K%P

0x1BC
Perhaps she also has a more psychological problem.%K%P

0x1C8
Anyway, I need to quickly establish an emotional bond%Nwith Saki.%K%P

0x1D4
Though I think that, not one thing worthwhile has%Nhappened today.%K%P

0x1E0
I haven't found a single opportunity to naturally bond%Nwith her at this Camp.%K%P

0x1EC
In the end, I just dragged myself along as I went with the%Nflow, and now we've all finally arrived at the pier.%K%P

0x1F8
No, wait! Doesn't this mean that incident will...!?%K%P

0x220
—It's starting.%K%N

0x22C
Saki and Haruka's quarrel, that is...%K%N

0x238
I immediately start running.%K%P

0x244
Saki shakes off Haruka.%K%P

0x250
She then runs to the tip of the pier.%K%P

0x26C
Saki「AAAAAH!」%K%P

0x294
Saki screams at the same time as the booming roar of a%Nwave breaks out.%K%P

0x2A0
What a monstrous wave!%K%P

0x2AC
The same unbelievably large wave from that day strikes%Nthe pier with a large sheet of water!%K%P

0x2B8
As it strikes, the wave devours Saki and drags her into%Nthe ocean!%K%P

0x2C4
(How the hell did I forget about something so important!!?)%K

0x8E8
Dive into the sea.

0x8F4
Watch for a bit.

0x350
This time, I don't hesitate.%K%P

0x35C
I continue to run, then jump off the tip of the pier into the%Nocean!%K%P

0x3FC
I desperately grab Saki's body as she starts to sink%Ntowards the maelstrom.%K%N

0x408
Her weight is straining my arm.%K%N

0x414
Ocean water floods into my throat.%K%N%N

0x420
—I'll be damned if I die here!%K%P

0x470
When I finally raise our heads out in an interval between%Nthe waves, I hear the group's voices.%K%P

0x47C
Kurumi「ONII-CHAAAAAAAN!」%K%P

0x488
Yuka「SAKIII!」%K%P

0x494
While holding Saki, I aim for the banks.%K%P

0x4D8
I finally barely manage to make it to shore, and I lift Saki's%Nbody up onto the top of the pier.%K%P

0x4E4
At that time... I see a light in Saki's hand.%K%P

0x508
It's that bell, isn't it...?%K%P

0x514
I quickly grab the bell and stick it in my pocket.%K%P

0x550
When I also quickly get up on the pier, I hold Saki in my%Narms.%K%P

0x55C
Saki's face is pale, and she's completely lost%Nconsciousness.%K%P

0x568
For some reason, her expression is strikingly beautiful.%K%P

0x574
Makoto「Saki! Saki!」%K%P

0x59C
I slap Saki's cheeks.%K%P

0x5A8
Saki's eyelids faintly move.%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「Have you come to your senses? Do you know who I am?」%K%P

0x5C8
Saki's eyes flutter open, and she blankly stares at me.%K%P

0x5D4
I turn around, and see everyone approaching...%K%P

0x5E0
Izumi「Has Saki-chan come to her senses?」%K%P

0x5EC
I give Izumi-san a nod, then turn my attention back to%NSaki.%K%P

0x5F8
She's still firmly staring at me...%K%P

0x604
It's here that I first realize it.%K%N

0x610
History is easy to change...%K%P

0x624
I decide to watch for a bit.%K%P

0x630
Immediately afterwards... Izumi-san runs and dives into%Nthe ocean off of the tip of the pier!%K%P

0x63C
(Damn it! ... This is all the same as last time, isn't it!?)%K%P

0x648
Izumi-san grabs Saki.%K%N

0x654
While holding her with one arm, she desperately swims%Nback.%K%P

0x660
And then, she finally arrives at the edge of the pier.%K%P

0x66C
I immediately lift up the limp Saki.%K%N

0x678
Izumi-san crawls up to the top of the banks with her own%Nstrength.%K%P

0x6EC
Saki's face is pale, and she's completely lost%Nconsciousness.%K%P

0x6F8
For some reason, her expression is strikingly beautiful.%K%P

0x704
Izumi「L-Look after her for a while. I'm going to go get some help!」%K%P

0x710
Kurumi「K-Kurumi will too!」%K%P

0x71C
Kurumi tails Izumi-san.%K%P

0x728
Makoto「Saki! Saki!」%K%P

0x734
I shake Saki's body.%K%P

0x740
At that time... I see a light in Saki's hand.%K%P

0x754
It's that bell, isn't it...?%K%P

0x760
I quickly grab the bell and stick it in my pocket.%K%P

0x774
Makoto「Are you all right? Do you know who I am?」%K%P

0x780
I slap Saki's cheeks.%K%N

0x78C
Saki's eyelids faintly move.%K%P

0x7A0
Saki's eyes flutter open, and she blankly stares at me.%K%P

0x7AC
I gaze back at her.%K%P

0x7B8
Her gaze is bewitching...%K%N

0x7C4
I can't quite look away...%K%P
