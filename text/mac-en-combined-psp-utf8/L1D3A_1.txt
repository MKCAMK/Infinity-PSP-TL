The clear morning light shines in.%K%P

0x140
For once, I wake up in eager anticipation.%K%P

0x14C
I can't help feeling anxious about what Haruka will do.%K%N

0x158
Will she keep her promise with me or not?%K%P

0x1AC
When I enter the living room, Yuka and Kurumi are already%Nthere. There's toast sitting on the table.%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x1F8
Yuka「Oh, Makoto. Good morning.」%K%P

0x214
Kurumi「Hi there, Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「Wow, so we actually have something edible for once.」%K%P

0x23C
Yuka「What's that supposed to mean?」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「N-Nothing... anyway, where did this come from?」%K%P

0x264
Kurumi「Onee-chan made it. See, you can count on us for all your%Nneeds!」%K%P

0x270
Makoto「You sound like you're in a good mood.」%K%P

0x27C
Kurumi「Right you are. C'mon, let's eat and get going.」%K%P

0x288
Makoto「Huh? Wh-Where to?」%K%P

0x294
Kurumi「We're gonna play tennis.」%K%P

0x2A8
Yuka「Ah, I didn't tell you, but that's what's on today's schedule.」%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「Well, you see, I can't...」%K%P

0x2C8
Yuka「What? These are your group leader's orders, you know.」%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「I take it you didn't tell Haruka either?」%K%P

0x2E0
Yuka「Wh-What's with the scary face all of the sudden?」%K%P

0x2EC
Kurumi「Haruka-san hasn't woken up yet. Same with Okkun.」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「I-I see...」%K%P

0x304
Kurumi「Kurumi's starving. Can we eat now?」%K%P

0x318
Yuka「You're right. Let's eat〜!」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「Ah, let's... eat...」%K%P

0x330
We all begin eating the toast. However, because I'm%Nworried about Haruka, it has no flavor to me.%K%P

0x33C
Just as I'm about to finish eating, Haruka comes running%Ninto the living room.%K%P

0x348
Okuhiko rushes in after her.%K%P

0x35C
Okuhiko「Promise? What promise?」%K%P

0x368
Haruka「... I'm going fishing today.」%K%P

0x374
Okuhiko「Fishing? That's fine. I'll teach you how to do it. So let's go%Ntogether, okay?」%K%P

0x390
Yuka「Hold on. We're scheduled to play tennis today.」%K%P

0x39C
Haruka「Huh? ... Tennis?」%K%P

0x3A8
Yuka「Haruka, you can't just say 'I'll pass' today. That'd be%Ngoing against the group leader's orders.」%K%P

0x3BC
Haruka looks at me with a troubled expression.%K%P

0x3D8
Okuhiko「That's right, Haruka-chan. As planned, we're playing%Ntennis. Fishing is just for old geezers anyway.」%K%P

0x3E4
Haruka「I made a promise...」%K%P

0x3F0
Okuhiko「It's fine, just cancel that promise.」%K%P

0x3FC
Haruka「I have to keep my promise no matter what...!」%K%P

0x410
Okuhiko「...!」%K%P

0x41C
Haruka「It's something that shows we trust each other.」%K%P

0x438
Yuka「Haruka...」%K%P

0x444
Haruka「I have to keep my promise no matter what...」%K%P

0x460
Kurumi「Haruka-san, who did you make that promise with?」%K%P

0x474
Haruka「It was...」%K

0xC98
"... With me."

0xCA4
"..."

0x4CC
Makoto「... With me.」%K%P

0x4E0
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x508
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x514
Makoto「Haruka and I are going fishing today. We're not going to%Nplay tennis.」%K%P

0x530
Okuhiko「Wh-Why is Ishihara saying that? Is this true,%NHaruka-chan?」%K%P

0x53C
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x560
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x56C
I remain silent. Haruka is looking at me. I avert my eyes.%K%P

0x578
"With me". Even though those words should easily come%Nout of my mouth... they don't.%K%P

0x584
My own words, "And you trust me too," are piercing my%Nheart.%K%P

0x598
Kurumi「It can't be... with... Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x5A4
Kurumi realizes that Haruka is looking at me.%K%P

0x5B0
I resolve myself.%K%P

0x5BC
Makoto「Yeah... it's with me.」%K%P

0x5E4
Makoto「Haruka and I are going fishing today. We're not going to%Nplay tennis.」%K%P

0x600
Okuhiko「Wh-Why is Ishihara saying that? Is this true,%NHaruka-chan?」%K%P

0x60C
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「So we'll be going now. Sorry Yuka, but we're going to%Nhave to ignore your orders.」%K%P

0x634
Yuka「Well, that's fine. The leader's not a dictator, after all.」%K%P

0x650
Okuhiko「Just hold on, Yuka-chan. You can't just let them off this%Neasy. Ishihara, you still don't understand? The basis of%Nthis seminar is group activities, isn't it?」%K%P

0x65C
Makoto「You have no right to say that.」%K%P

0x670
Okuhiko「What was that...!?」%K%P

0x684
I leave the living room.%K%P

0x690
Haruka quickly follows me.%K%P

0x69C
However, Okuhiko is hot on Haruka's heels.%K%P

0x6B0
Okuhiko「Wait, Haruka-chan. What happened between you and%NIshihara?」%K%P

0x6C4
Haruka「... We made a promise.」%K%P

0x6D0
Okuhiko「That's not an explanation. What happened between you%Nand Ishihara yesterday?」%K%P

0x6DC
Haruka「I'm not going to tell you.」%K%P

0x6E8
Okuhiko「Why not?」%K%P

0x6FC
Haruka「This is something between me and Makoto... It doesn't%Nconcern you, Okuhiko.」%K%P

0x710
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan...!」%K%P

0x734
At that moment, Saki comes in carrying a basket.%K%P

0x740
She glances at Okuhiko as she places it on the table.%NShe's kinda cheerful this morning.%K%P

0x770
Saki「Good morning, everyone! Thank you for your concern%Nyesterday!」%K%P

0x77C
Saki's optimistic voice ends our argument anticlimatically.%K%P

0x790
Saki「What's wrong? Why are you all silent? Oh, is it me? I was%Ndischarged from the clinic. They said I only had to stay%None night, remember?」%K%P

0x7AC
Yuka「Ah, Saki, that's not it...」%K%P

0x7B8
Saki「Huh? Then what? Is it something else about me?」%K%P

0x7C4
Yuka「No... It's not about you, Saki...」%K%P

0x7E0
Kurumi「Hey, what's that, Saki-san?」%K%P

0x7F4
She points to the basket, and Saki throws Okuhiko a coy%Nglance.%K%P

0x808
Saki「Um, Okuhiko-kun. I tried making these, what do you think?」%K%P

0x814
She opens the basket, which contains small sandwiches%Nthat are neatly lined up.%K%P

0x828
Kurumi「Wow, it's cute〜. Saki-san, did you make these for Okkun?」%K%P

0x834
Saki「Huh? No, I just made these on a whim, that's all...」%K%P

0x840
Kurumi「Take a look, Okkun. You're quite the lucky guy, huh?」%K%P

0x85C
Okuhiko「Impressive, Saki-chan. You knew exactly what I liked.」%K%P

0x868
Saki「Ah, er, uh... what should I...」%K%P

0x874
Okuhiko「I'm happy.」%K%P

0x888
I wordlessly stare in shock.%K%P

0x894
Suddenly, Haruka grabs my hand and starts to drag me%Nalong as I look at her in surprise.%K%P

0x8CC
She takes me outside, avoiding eye contact with Saki.%NOkuhiko frantically tries to go after us.%K%P

0x8D8
At that moment, Saki grabs Okuhiko's arm with her hands.%K%P

0x8E4
Saki「Okuhiko-kun, you don't feel like playing tennis? I was%Nhoping we could play at the court.」%K%P

0x8F0
Okuhiko「... S-Sounds good. Fishing is just for old geezers%Nanyway, I don't want to do that.」%K%P

0x8FC
Saki「Huh, fishing?」%K%P

0x908
Okuhiko「Ah, it's nothing. I'm impressed, Saki-chan. You knew I liked%Ntennis?」%K%P

0x914
I smirk as I listen to Okuhiko's spiteful voice.%K%P

0x920
Serves you right!%K%N

0x92C
Damn, this feels good. Looks like karma does exist after%Nall...%K%P
