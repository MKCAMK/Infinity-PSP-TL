Kurumi is still worried about that "breast" issue, so she's%Ntoo anxious to go the pool.%K%P

0x7C
I didn't want to leave Kurumi and go to the pool by%Nmyself... so we ended up waiting at Lunabeach until%Neveryone returns.%K%P

0x88
Makoto「Hmm... cooking really does run in the family...」%K%P

0x94
Right now, I'm eating some carbonara that Kurumi made.%K%P

0xA0
Makoto「I feel that this could rival that meal Izumi-san made%Nyesterday.」%K%P

Kurumi「Eheh♪ Thank you♪」%K%P

0xF8
Kurumi「Wrong, wrong! You're completely wrong! Mama has no%Nsense of taste whatsoever!」%K%P

0x104
Makoto「Huh, really?」%K%P

0x110
Kurumi「Well, in the first place, Mama doesn't cook all that much...」%K%P

0x11C
Makoto「Why?」%K%P

0x128
Kurumi「Because she's busy with work.」%K%P

0x134
Makoto「Hmm... then both of your parents work?」%K%P

0x140
Kurumi「Right, right. Actually, they work together...」%K%P

0x14C
Kurumi「Papa and Mama... their relationship at work is 'doctor' and%N'assistant'.」%K%P

0x158
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x164
Kurumi「Have you ever heard of Shigezo Morino...?」%K%P

0x170
Shigezo Morino... I feel like I've heard that name before...%K%P

0x1A8
Kurumi「Geez! Don't shout so suddenly!」%K%P

0x1B4
Makoto「I had to get that out!」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「So in other words, your father and Izumi-san's father is%NDr. Morino?」%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「Of course!」%K%P

0x1EC

0x1F8
Kurumi「Hold on!」%K%P

0x204
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x210
Kurumi「Kurumi doesn't know those details very well... After all,%NPapa is Papa, and his daughter is his daughter...」%K%P

0x21C
Makoto「O-Oh... I see. But to think that you're Dr. Morino's%Ndaughter...」%K%P

0x228
Kurumi「Think of it this way: instead of 'The apple doesn't fall far%Nfrom the tree', it's instead 'The apple fell far from the%Ntree.'」%K%P

0x234
Makoto「No, that's not what I meant...」%K%P

0x240
Kurumi「But even though everyone says Papa's so amazing, at%Nhome, he's just a normal dad.」%K%P

0x24C
Kurumi「After getting out of the bath, he loiters around in his%Nunderwear without a care...」%K%P

0x258
Kurumi「When he wakes up in the morning, he isolates himself in%Nthe bathroom, reading his newspaper...」%K%P

0x264
Kurumi「On the weekend, he spends all his time playing with his%Nrodents...」%K%P

0x270
Kurumi「Truth is, he's no different from any normal father...」%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「... I wouldn't know if he's what you'd call normal or not,%Napart from the whole rodent thing...」%K%P

0x288
Kurumi「Huh? Is that strange?」%K%P

0x294
Makoto「Well, I guess not.. There already are a lot of people who%Ntake care of Roborovski and Djungarian hamsters...」%K%P

0x2A0
Kurumi「Oh, but the ones at home aren't like that.」%K%P

0x2AC
Kurumi「They're THAT huge!」%K%P

0x2B8
When she says "THAT", Kurumi stretches her arms as%Nwide as she can to show me.%K%P

0x2C4
If what she's saying is true, then the rodents seem to be%Nthe same size as Kurumi.%K%P

0x2D0
Huh...???%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「Sorry. Let me correct myself. Your dad is weird after all,%NKurumi...」%K%P

Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「... Well, either way is fine...」%K%P

0x318
If I inquire any further, I fear that I'll hear things that I%Ndon't want to hear...%K%P

0x324
Kurumi's father is an expert in genetic engineering...%K%N

0x330
At home, he raises large rodents...%K%N

0x33C
Yeah... that's enough for me...%K%P

0x348
Makoto「... So in other words, that means your mother is Dr.%NMorino's assistant?」%K%P

0x354
Kurumi「That's right. That's why Mama has no time to cook.」%K%P

0x360
Kurumi「Kurumi thinks the reason why Onee-chan is so good at%Ncooking is probably because she's always cooking in%NMama's place.」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「Hmm... I see.」%K%P

0x378
Nevertheless, the carbonara Kurumi made was superb...%K%P
