She bolts open the door and runs outside.%K%N

0x74
I look for Kurumi, looking left and right.%K%P

0x80
Step, step, step, step...%K%N

0x8C
I can hear footsteps on the sand.%K%N

0x98
—She's at Moon Beach!%K%P

0xD0
I jump over the banks, and land on the sandy beach.%K%N

0xDC
I see Kurumi's back as she runs south down the beach...%K%P

0xE8
I start running, kicking off the sand.%K%P

0xF4
I fill my body with strength as I run...%K%N

0x100
The sand flies up behind me as I run across it...%K%N

0x10C
Kurumi's getting closer and closer...%K%P

0x118
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0x124
... I firmly grab her slim arm.%K%N

0x130
The two of us stagger and pitch forward.%K%N

0x13C
I regain my balance, and turn Kurumi around...%K%P

0x16C
Makoto「Kurumi...」%K%P

0x178
Kurumi is crying.%K%N

0x184
Large teardrops begin to pour out of her eyes...%K%P

0x190
She keeps wiping them away with her palms, but more%Ntears just keep on coming.%K%P

0x1B8
Kurumi「O... Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x1C4
Kurumi「Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x1D0
Her shoulders repeatedly tremble as she tries as hard%Nas she can to hold back her weeping...%K%N

0x1DC
... Kurumi's desperately... trying to say something...%K%P

0x1E8
Kurumi「You're... You're the... You're the same... as...」%K%P

0x1F4
Kurumi「Onii-chan... you're the same as him...」%K%P

0x200
Kurumi「You're the same... as... that... senpai...」%K%P

0x20C
Senpai...?%K%P

0x218
By "senpai"... she must be referring to that guy from her%Nmiddle school days...%K%P

0x224
Kurumi「Everyone's... Everyone's... lying...」%K%P

0x230
Kurumi「Even... Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x23C
Kurumi「Even though... Kurumi trusted you...」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「Kurumi... what are you talking about!? I-」%K%P

0x254
Kurumi「Kurumi... heard you just now!」%K%P

0x260
Makoto「'Heard'...?」%K%P

0x26C
Kurumi「'It was much more horrifying... than I ever could have%Nimagined...'」%K%P

0x278
Kurumi「Horrifying... you said that, didn't you!?」%K%P

0x284
I feel like a dagger has been thrust into my heart...%K%P

0x290
I definitely... said that.%K%N

0x29C
"Horrifying"...%K%N

0x2A8
"Horrifying"... I said that.%K%P

0x2B4
Kurumi「Everyone... everyone... everyone Kurumi loves... just%Ndoes nothing but...」%K%P

0x2C0
Kurumi「Always... deceive Kurumi...」%K%P

0x32C
Makoto「Kurumi—」%K%P

0x338
Kurumi「Leave me alone! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY!!」%K%P

0x378
Kurumi breaks off into a run.%K%N

0x384
Rain begins to fall from the sky...%K%P

0x390
(I have to go after her!)%K%P

0x39C
(If I let her go now, then...)%K%P

0x3A8
(... She'll never recover!)%K%P

0x3B4
—I pick up the pursuit.%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0x3CC
I call out to her to stop, but she doesn't turn around.%K%N

0x3D8
Kurumi climbs up the bank...%K%N

0x3E4
She jumps down to the other side, and vanishes.%K%N

0x3F0
I race to the top of the bank.%K%P

0x3FC
Once I'm there, my eyes scan the beach.%K%P

0x408
...%K%N

0x414
She's gone...!%K%N

0x420
She's nowhere to be found!%K%N

0x42C
I look everywhere, but there's no sign of her!%K%P

0x464
I descend the bank.%K%N

0x470
I run to the west, down the road alongside the coastline...%K%N

0x47C
... I continue to run for a while, but there's still no trace of%Nher in this direction.%K%P

0x4B4
I go back the way I came.%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「KURUMIIII!!」%K%P

0x4CC
I scream, even though I know there's no way she'll%Nanswer...%K%P

0x4E8
...%K%P

0x520
In the end, I'm back in front of Lunabeach...%K%P

0x52C
(Kurumi...)%K%P

0x538
(Where did you go... Kurumi...)%K%P

0x5D0
Something cold and wet hits me on the forehead over%Nand over again...%K%P

0x5DC
(Rain, huh...?)%K%P

0x5E8
It's beginning to drizzle... In order to avoid it, I go under%Nthe overhang of Lunabeach.%K%P

0x5F4
I look at the rain for a while...%K%P

0x600
(A place Kurumi would go... a place Kurumi would go... a%Nplace Kurumi would go...)%K%P

0x60C
(A place Kurumi would go... Come to think of it...)%K%P

0x618
Kurumi「Kurumi... remembers this place.」%K%P

0x624
Kurumi「Kurumi's... been here before...」%K%P

0x630
Kurumi「That shrine... had a very nostalgic scent to it.」%K%P

0x63C
Kurumi「It was the smell of the traditional clothes... that Kurumi%Ngot as hand-me-downs from Onee-chan when she was%Nyounger...」%K%P

0x648
I start running once more...%K%P

0x6DC
By the time I arrive in front of the long staircase, the%Ndrizzle has become a constant rain.%K%P

0x6E8
I wipe off the raindrops from my soaked forehead with%Nthe back of my hand.%K%P

0x6F4
(Kurumi is definitely up ahead...)%K%P

0x700
I begin to run up the stairs...%K%P

0x760
In the deep darkness, the shrine stands out like%Nsomething faintly white against a dark background.%K%N

0x76C
The raindrops pelting the roof become a thin mist that%Nenvelops the shrine.%K%P

0x778
Its faint and gray appearance makes it look like a mirage.%K%P

0x784
I tumble into the illusion-like shrine while slipping across%Nthe stone paving, wet from the rain.%K%P

0x824
—She's not here.%K%N

0x830
She's not here...%K%N

0x83C
Kurumi isn't here either...%K%P

0x848
Frustrated, I can feel my blood rush through my body.%K%N

0x854
I'm enraged for running all this way for nothing and being%Nunable to voice my frustrations.%K%P

0x860
My restlessness reaches nearly unrestrainable levels,%Nand just seems to burst open.%K%P

0x86C
I vent my irritation by kicking one of the shrine's pillars%Nas hard as I can.%K%N

0x878
Even so, I'm still mad...%K%P

0x884
I wander aimlessly around the shrine.%K%P

0x890
Suddenly, I look at my watch.%K%P

0x89C
"6 SAT 12:54 A.M."%K%P

0x8EC
The sound... of that bell...?%K%P

0x8F8
(No... that's wrong!)%K%P

0x904
That's a different sound than the bell in my dream.%K%P

0x910
It's an altar bell—a bell dangling from a small building%Nmodeled after a small Shinto shrine that rests on the%Naltar.%K%P

0x91C
There's probably a draft blowing from somewhere that's%Ncausing the bell to swing...%K%P

0x928
"Bell"...%K%N

0x934
"Bell"...%K%N

0x940
"Bell"...%K%N

0x94C
It can't be...%K%P

0x994
What if, by any chance, Kurumi has that bell right now...?%K%N

0x9A0
At that moment, cold shivers run up my spine.%K%P

0x9AC
No, that's impossible!%K%N

0x9B8
I definitely threw that bell into the ocean on the night of%Nthe 1st!%K%P

0x9C4
But... what if that bell were washed ashore to the beach%Nby waves...?%K%P

0x9D0
Today is Saturday, April 6th.%K%N

0x9DC
If that dream was a prophetic dream, then...%K%P

0xA0C
I violently shake my head to shake off that delusion.%K%P

0xA18
(There's no way...)%K%P

0xA24
(No matter what... that's absolutely impossible!)%K%P

0xA30
I bite down on my lip hard.%K%P

0xA3C
The shrine's exterior... I stare at the edge of the rooftop,%Nwhere rain is flowing down like a waterfall.%K%P

0xA48
Rage surges in my heart like billows.%K%P

0xA54
I try to wash away that hopeless dream, but it just won't%Ndisappear.%K%P

0xA60
Like a deep stain, whenever I try to wipe it away, it just%Nspreads even more throughout my mind...%K%P

0xA6C
(Anyway... I need to keep looking...)%K%P

0xA78
(There's no way I can leave her alone as she is right%Nnow...)%K%P

0xA84
The cold rain... I run once again in the rumbling, roaring%Ndownpour...%K%P

0xB50
I keep running as fast as I can as the rain beats on me.%K%N

0xB5C
I keep looking for Kurumi...%K%P

0xB94
Princess Beach... the sand on the shore has become%Nhardened from all the water.%K%P

0xBA0
Kurumi「Hey, Mr. Crab. Wanna play Rock-Paper-Scissors with%NKurumi?」%K%P

0xBAC
Suddenly, I hear Kurumi's voice.%K%N

0xBB8
I turn around and survey my surroundings.%K%P

0xBC4
However... no one's there...%K%N

0xBD0
Kurumi's nowhere to be found...%K%P

0xBDC
The cold rain is stealing away more and more of my body%Nheat.%K%N

0xBE8
My field of vision becomes hazy, and I'm unable to focus%Non anything.%K%N

0xBF4
My consciousness becomes dim due to the dizziness in%Nmy head.%K%P

0xC00
(Kurumi...)%K%P

0xC0C
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xC18
Kurumi「No... it's nothing!」%K%P

0xC24
Kurumi「Kurumi just picked up something a little interesting!」%K%P

0xC30
Something... interesting...%K%P

0xC74
It couldn't be that the thing...%K%N

0xC80
... That she picked up back then...%K%N

0xC8C
was the "bell"...?%K%P

0xC98
Is that it...?%K%N

0xCA4
Is that really it...?%W%W%W%K%P

0xCB0
I shiver in fear.%K%N

0xCBC
The strength throughout my body begins to disappear...%K%P

0xCC8
Against my will, I struggle to take a step forward.%K%P

0xCD4
Just like that, I stagger as I leave Princess Beach...%K%P

0xD50
Kurumi「Ah, Onii-chan♪」%K%P

0xD5C
Kurumi「Kurumi came here to meet Onii-chan!」%K%P

0xD68
Kurumi「So let's go watch some crab sumo♪」%K%P

0xDE8
Kurumi「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0xDF4
Kurumi「Wanna go see an interesting place?」%K%P

0xE00
Kurumi「You'll see♪ Come with Kurumi♪」%K%P

0xE38
My bedroom...%K%N

0xE44
An empty bedroom...%K%N

0xE50
So she didn't come to the lodge after all...%K%P

0xE5C
Kurumi「Onii-chan!」%K%P

0xE68
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan!」%K%P

0xE74
Kurumi「Geez, if you don't wake up soon, aren't you going to be%Nlate!?」%K%P

0xE80
... These auditory hallucinations still won't stop.%K%N

0xE8C
Kurumi's voice continues to echo in my eardrums.%K%N

0xE98
It's like they're rebuking me...%K%P

0xF20
Moon Beach...%K%P

0xF58
The shopping district...%K%P

0xF90
The harbor...%K%P

0xFC8
She's nowhere to be found...%K%N

0xFD4
I've wandered all around the island, searching for Kurumi...%K%P

0xFE0
I drag along my numb feet...%K%P

0x10D4
I finally arrive at Viewpoint Park, but in the end, I'm unable%Nto find Kurumi.%K%P

0x10E0
In the darkness, I hear the sound of the waves crashing%Nagainst the cape.%K%P

0x10EC
It seems like the "darkness" itself that's enveloped the%Nworld is letting out a furious roar.%K%P

0x1104
Viewpoint Park...%K%N

0x1110
This is where I first...%K%P

0x11CC
... saw Kurumi's eyes clouded by sadness.%K%P

0x11D8
Kurumi「Did you know? Kurumi loves floating in the water... Like a%Njellyfish...」%K%P

0x11E4
Kurumi「When she does that, it feels kinda nostalgic...」%K%P

0x11F0
Kurumi「The truth is... Kurumi... really wanted to go with everyone...」%K%P

0x11FC
Kurumi「To the pool... and the hot springs...」%K%P

0x126C
I called Kurumi's scar "horrifying." I'd intended to take%Nthat pain away... but the truth is, I was avoiding it.%K%P

0x1278
I loathe that scar. I can't even touch it. I can't heal%NKurumi's scar.%K%P

0x1284
Her true scar—is the one that's been very deeply%Nengraved into the innermost depths of her heart...%K%P

0x1290
(I wonder what she's... thinking about right now.)%K%P

0x129C
(The scar... her relation by blood... both of those were%Nhuge shocks to her...)%K%P

0x12A8
...%K%N

0x12B4
No... if that's the case...%K%N

0x12C0
If that's the case, then is Kurumi really at the shrine...!?%K%P

0x12CC
The scar and her blood relationship... and the fact that%Nthere's no doubt that the shrine's connected to her%Nsomehow.%K%N

0x12D8
Kurumi probably already knows that... I said something%Nsimilar in my talk with Izumi-san.%K%P

0x12E4
When I was making those enquiries to Izumi-san, Kurumi%Nheard me say those things, and thought to herself...%K%P

0x12F0
(I'll try going to the shrine one more time...)%K%P

0x12FC
The instant I think that, the eastern sky starts to%Nbecome bright.%K%N

0x1308
The morning sun slowly creeps overhead.%K%P

0x1314
However, its light is completely shrouded by heavy rain%Nclouds...%K%P
