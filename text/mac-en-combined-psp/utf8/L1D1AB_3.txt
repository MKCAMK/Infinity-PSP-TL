Announcer「Today is Monday, April 1st. This is the afternoon news.」%K%P

0x7C
We hear a polite voice from the announcer on TV, which%Nis still on.%K%P

0x88
At that moment, a bird chirps...%K%P

0x94
The rather sharp and shrill noise fills my ears.%K%P

0xA0
I try to find out where it is coming from.%K%P

0xAC
I find it in the upper-right corner of the giant glass%Nwindow overlooking the ocean.%K%P

0xC4
Makoto「A cuckoo clock... This the first time I've seen one...」%K%P

0xD0
My voice is full of awe.%K%P

0xF4
Yuka「Huh? You just noticed it?」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「Yeah, just now.」%K%P

0x114
At 10, I was changing my clothes in my room, and at 11, I%Nwas caught up with that repulsive meal, so I missed the%Nsound of the clock both times.%K%P

0x120
Yuka「I was also surprised when I first noticed it yesterday.」%K%P

0x12C
I look around to find that nobody else is surprised by%Nthis.%K%P

0x138
... Oh, right. Yuka, Haruka, and Okuhiko arrived before me%Nyesterday, so they've already heard it.%K%P

0x14C
Yuka「It's kind of nostalgic...」%K%P

0x158
Yuka「If my memory serves me right, the last time I saw one of%Nthose things was in middle school...」%K%P

0x164
Makoto「Huh...」%K%P

0x170
Yuka「It was a little bigger than this one, and had two doors on%Nit, not one.」%K%P

0x17C
Yuka「Of course, there were two birds... I'm pretty sure I thought%Nthey were a male and female pair of doves...」%K%P

0x188
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x194
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1A0
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x1B4
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「Huh? Aren't you going to continue?」%K%P

0x1CC
Yuka「No... that's all there is to it.」%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「'That's all there is'...?」%K%P

0x1E4
Something doesn't feel right.%K%P

0x1F0
I feel that at the tip of that conversation, there's an%Neven greater story behind it that's now been washed%Naway.%K%P

0x1FC
It's obvious just by looking at her.%K%P

0x208
Just now, there was a faint glitter in her eyes.%K%P

0x224
Okuhiko「Hey, shouldn't we go now?」%K%P

0x230
As he rises, Okuhiko flicks his long bangs away from his%Nface.%K%P

0x23C
Yuka「Yeah, you're right. It'll be a big waste of time if we stayed%Nindoors all day.」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「Where are we going?」%K%P

0x254
Okuhiko「Isn't it obvious?」%K%P

0x260
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x274
Yuka「To play T-E-N-N-I-S.」%K%P

0x280
Makoto「Te-Tennis!?」%K%P

0x28C
Yuka「Well then, everyone, please get ready!」%K%P

0x298
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2A4
Well, that was unexpected.%K%P

0x2B0
It's not that tennis itself is a problem.%K%P

0x2BC
It's that Yuka and Okuhiko just said "let's play tennis"%Nlike it was nothing, and there seems to be no issue with it.%K%P

0x2C8
Just what is...%K%P

0x348
Makoto「Just what is... this 'Seminar Camp' anyway?」%K%P

0x354
I ask Yuka this on our way to the tennis court, since%Nshe's our leader.%K%P

0x360
Yuka「What do you mean?」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「I mean... So aside from the traditional meaning of seminar,%Nthere's also other things implemented in it, like 'clubs'%Nand 'social activities'?」%K%P

0x378
Yuka nods in affirmation.%K%P

0x384
Makoto「Even so, is it all right for us to suddenly start playing%Ntennis from the get go?」%K%P

0x398
Yuka「It's all right. There's absolutely no problems with it.」%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「... Hey, Yuka. May I ask you what's really been bugging%Nme?」%K%P

0x3B0
Yuka「Go ahead.」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「In the first place, just what is a 'Seminar Camp'?」%K%P

0x3D0
Yuka「'Just what is it', you say... Obviously, it's 'camping' in a%N'seminar'.」%K

0x10A8
Don't ask any more.

0x10B4
"What do you mean, 'seminar'?"

0x410
Makoto「That's enough for me.」%K%P

0x41C
Yuka「Really?」%K%P

0x428
I can tell Yuka's a bit dubious.%K%P

0x43C
Makoto「'Camping' in a 'seminar'... Yeah, it makes sense.」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「But what does it mean by 'seminar', exactly?」%K%P

0x45C
Yuka「What!? Are you kidding, Makoto?」%K%P

0x468
Makoto「No, I'm being totally serious. I rarely went to my classes,%Nso I'm completely clueless about things like this.」%K%P

0x47C
Yuka「Hmm... I'm surprised, I didn't think that there were students%Nin our college by this time who didn't know about the%Nmeaning of the 'Seminar', but...」%K%P

0x490
Yuka「Well, it can't be helped. I'll tell you about it.」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「I'd appreciate it.」%K%P

0x4B0
Yuka「Okay. So you know how that originally, very liberal%Ncolleges offered a 'Seminar' program in which senior%Nyear students could join and research a topic of their%Nchoice, right?」%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x4C8
Yuka「So basically, if you think of the 'Seminar' as a 'lab', I don't%Nthink they'd mind.」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Interesting.」%K%P

0x4E0
Yuka「Right? And at the end of the year, they had to publish%Nthe research results of the 'Seminar', in a so-called%N'bachelor's thesis'.」%K%P

0x4EC
Yuka「If that 'bachelor's thesis' was approved by various%Ndistinguished teachers, that student would be all clear%Nto graduate...」%K%P

0x4F8
Yuka「However, it doesn't seem like many colleges or%Nundergraduate programs have a place for such things%Nanymore, but our college is still keeping that system%Nalive...」%K%P

0x504
Makoto「Wait a minute. But we're only just about to become%Njuniors, right?」%K%P

0x510
Yuka「Right. Technically, we're actually members of a%N'Pre-Seminar'.」%K%P

0x51C
Makoto「Pre-Seminar?」%K%P

0x528
Yuka「Think of it as a sort of prep course for the real seminar%Nthat starts next year. A sort of prerequisite, if you will.」%K%P

0x534
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x540
Yuka「Get it now?」%K%P

0x54C
Makoto「More or less.」%K%P

0x558
Yuka「Good. You'll be fine, then. Honestly, I don't fully%Nunderstand it either.」%K%P

0x564
Makoto「... Ah, but... There's one thing I still don't get.」%K%P

0x570
Yuka「What's that?」%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「The goal of this Camp...」%K%P

0x588
I take a look over my shoulder. Okuhiko is behind me and%NYuka, walking right next to Haruka.%K%P

0x594
Okuhiko is trying to start a conversation with Haruka,%Nwhich doesn't seem to be working.%K%P

0x5A0
When I quickly turn my head back, it's as if I can hear him%Nquietly grumble to himself.%K%P

0x5AC
Makoto「Okuhiko thinks 'From the start, there was no goal. If there%Ntruly is one, then it's only to deepen the bonds of%Nfriendship between the group members.' Is he right?」%K%P

0x5B8
Yuka「Close! That's close, but it's a little different from that.」%K%P

0x5C4
Makoto「How so?」%K%P

0x5D8
Yuka「I still... can't tell you that.」%K%P

0x5E4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x5F8
Yuka「Well, I was ordered not to.」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「Ordered?」%K%P

0x618
Yuka「They're direct, official orders from the professor in%Ncharge. 'Until the last day of the Camp, don't tell anyone%Nthe purpose behind it.'」%K%P

0x624
Makoto「Why...?」%K%P

0x638
Yuka「Geez, stop being so persistent!」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「But-」%K%P

0x658
Yuka「The First Law of Professor Yuka's Love Formula:%N—'Dislike persistent men.' —Please remember that♪」%K%P

0x66C
Yuka gives me a kind smile.%K%P

0x694
That smile makes my heart pound loudly.%K%P

0x6A0
I can feel my ears burn hot.%K%P

0x6AC
When I realize what that means, I try not to act anxious.%K%P

0x6B8
"Dislike persistent men." —Dislike... who?%K%P

0x6C4
Flustered, I feel the wind playfully brush against my%Ncheeks.%K%P

0x724
It takes us five minutes to walk from the lodge to the%Ntennis court.%K%P

0x738
Yuka「All right then, let's play!」%K%P

0x744
Yuka has rented four rackets from the court's manager,%Nand forced them into our hands.%K%P

0x750
It's almost blinding how much joy her eyes are radiating.%K%P

0x75C
Just then...%K%P

0x778
Haruka「I'll... pass...」%K%P

0x784
... She places the racket she had just received gently%Nagainst the bench.%K%P

0x798
Yuka「Whaaat?」%K%P

0x7B4
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan, you're not playing!?」%K%P

0x7C0
He is much more disturbed by this than Yuka.%K%P

0x7CC
Now that I think about it, Okuhiko seemed to be extremely%Neager to play tennis.%K%P

0x7D8
I bet that because he was brought up as practically%Nnobility, he probably had private lessons on how to play%Ntennis since he was a kid.%K%P

0x7E4
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x7F8
Okuhiko「But won't you get bored just watching us?」%K%P

0x804
Haruka「I'm not going to watch.」%K%P

0x818
Okuhiko「Huh?」%K%P

0x824
Haruka「Because... I want to see the ocean...」%K%P

0x838
Okuhiko「The ocean? ... You want to go to the ocean?」%K%P

0x844
Haruka gives a small nod.%K%P

0x850
Okuhiko「The ocean, huh...」%K%P

0x864
Okuhiko「Then I'm going too.」%K%P

0x880
Yuka「Huh, you too, Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0x894
Okuhiko「Come on, think about it. We're finally by the ocean, aren't%Nwe? It's only natural that we ought to see it first!」%K%P

0x8A0
Okuhiko「And besides, we can play tennis whenever we like, right?」%K%P

0x8B4
Yuka「I see... Well, that's too bad, but I guess it can't be helped.」%K%P

0x8C8
There's a victorious glint in Okuhiko's eyes. His mouth%Nalso warps into another smug smile.%K%P

0x8E4
Yuka「Then we'll be right here.」%K%P

0x8F0
—What? "We"? W... We?%K%P

0x8FC
So by "we", Yuka means me and her?%K

0x10C0
I also want to go to the ocean.

0x10CC
I'll play tennis with Yuka.

0x944
Makoto「Hey, wait a minute, Yuka.」%K%P

0x950
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x95C
Makoto「I never said I was going to play tennis.」%K%P

0x968
Yuka「??」%K%P

0x974
Makoto「I'm also... going to the ocean.」%K%P

0x988
Yuka「Huuuh!?」%K%P

0x9A4
Okuhiko faintly clicks his tongue as if to say "Dammit". It%Nwas a very quiet sound, but I definitely heard it.%K%P

0x9B0
If he's trying to be discreet, he's not doing a very good%Njob of it.%K%P

0x9C4
Yuka「Geez... and I was looking forward to playing too...」%K%P

0x9D0
... Well, I figured she'd say that.%K%P

0x9DC
It's impossible to play tennis solo.%K%P

0x9E8
Yuka「Haah...」%K%P

0x9F4
Yuka looks so depressed that it's making me feel guilty.%K%P

0xA00
But that's just the way things work. In groups, the%Nmajority rules.%K%P

0xA14
As Yuka begins to walk away, I call her over.%K%P

0xA20
Makoto「Hold on. What are you going to do with these?」%K%P

0xA2C
I point towards the rackets. I notice that Haruka left hers%Nthe way it was, leaning against the bench.%K%P

0xA40
Yuka「Huh? Ah, yeah, yeah, I know. I'll go collect and return them.」%K%P

0xA6C
Yuka rudely snatches mine out of my hands. She seems%Na bit mad...%K%P

0xA78
She takes the racket from the bench and swings it wildly.%NIt spins rapidly. Yep... she's pissed.%K%P

0xA84
Just then, I notice something, but by the time I think "Look%Nout...!" it's already too late.%K%P

0xAAC
A thick sound rings out.%K%P

0xAB8
Okuhiko「☆○◎×...!」%K%P

0xACC
Yuka「Ah...」%K%P

0xAE0
The racket smashes into the back of Okuhiko's head.%K%P

0xB08
Okuhiko collapses to the ground in a daze. Panicking,%NYuka crouches down and shakes his body. He's%Nknocked out.%K%P

0xB1C
Yuka「W-What should I do...」%K%P

0xB28
Makoto「Divine punishment, huh?」%K%P

0xB3C
Yuka「Why must I receive that...!?」%K%P

0xB48
Makoto「Not you, Yuka—Huh? Where's Haruka?」%K%P

0xB5C
I've lost sight of her. I look around... Found her. Haruka's%Nalready far away from the tennis court.%K%P

0xB68
Makoto「Yuka, I'll leave this to you.」%K%P

0xB7C
Yuka「Wha... Don't just go acting rashly!」%K%P

0xB88
Makoto「I'm going to go STOP her from acting rashly!」%K%P

0xBC4
I shout this over my shoulder before chasing after%NHaruka. She disappears as she goes around the%Nstreet's corner.%K%P

0xC18
... Well, whatever.%K%P

0xC24
It's not like I hate tennis. Besides, I could use a little%Nexercise.%K%P

0xC30
The chilly, fresh morning air almost makes my bones ache.%K%P

0xC4C
Okuhiko「Well, see you later.」%K%P

0xC60
Okuhiko starts walking away.%K%P

0xC6C
Haruka already left long before him.%K%P

0xC78
Though she had left with a rather stony expression, I%Nbet Haruka was thrilled to leave.%K%P

0xC8C
Yuka「Get back before evening, okay?」%K%P

0xC98
Yuka shouts this to Okuhiko.%K%P

0xCA4
Without turning around, he casually waves in%Nacknowledgement.%K%P

0xCB0
He's trying way too hard to act cool, but that's Okuhiko%Nfor you.%K%P

0xCC4
Yuka「Well then, I'm going to go change my clothes.」%K%P

0xCD0
Makoto「Change... into what?」%K%P

0xCE4
Yuka「Tennis wear!」%K%P

0xCF8
Yuka「After all, I can't exactly play tennis that well in these%Nclothes, can I?」%K%P

0xD04
To emphasize her point, Yuka pinches the collar of her%Nclothes.%K%P

0xD10
Makoto「I guess so...」%K%P

0xD24
Yuka「Mind waiting a minute, Makoto? I'll be back soon!」%K%P

0xD38
Yuka rushes over to the changing room next to the%Ncourt management office...%K%P
