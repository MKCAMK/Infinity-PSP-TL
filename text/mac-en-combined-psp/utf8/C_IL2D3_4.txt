The moonlight coldly shines on the tombstones.%K%P

0x80
The moist wind clings to my skin.%K%P

0x8C
Right now, I'm walking down the overgrown road in the%Ngraveyard.%K%P

0xA0
Izumi「It's... a little chilly...」%K%P

0xAC
Walking next to me is the slightly shivering Izumi-san...%K%P

0xC0
Yes! I've been waiting for this time!%K%P

0xCC
I already know that when the Test of Courage began,%NIzumi-san and I would be all alone.%K%P

0xD8
It's an ideal situation where no one can get in our way or%Nbe suspicious of us.%K%P

0xE4
It's already been nearly ten minutes since we left the%Nstarting point.%K%P

0xF0
We won't be able to hear the others talking or their%Nfootsteps.%K%P

0xFC
I think that this will be the best time for us to talk.%K%P

0x108
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x114
As I say this, I grab Izumi-san by the arm...%K%N

0x120
―And then drag her between the tombstones!%K%P

0x134
Izumi「Huh? Huh? What? What?」%K%P

0x140
I cover the confused Izumi-san's mouth with my left hand,%Nand point to my mouth with my right index finger.%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「From this point onward, we cannot allow ourselves to be%Ndiscovered...」%K%P

0x160
... Izumi-san silently nods.%K%P

0x16C
On my palm, I can feel the sensation of her wet lips...%K%P

0x178
Her warm breaths leak out and tickle the space between%Nmy fingers.%K%P

0x184
I'm getting kinda embarrassed... so I quickly take my palm%Noff of her.%K%P

0x1B4
Izumi「Ah, you surprised me...」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi「I was caught so off guard that my heart was pounding.」%K%P

0x1CC
I'm the one whose heart is pounding.%K%P

0x1D8
That beating intensifies when I look her spruce,%Ntransparent white skin...%K%P

0x1E4
The smooth lines on the back of her neck...%K%P

0x1F0
Her large, drooping breasts...%K%P

0x1FC
I instinctively gulp.%K%P

0x208
(Crap, crap...)%K%P

0x214
(What the hell am I thinking...?)%K%P

0x228
I quickly avert my gaze to shake off those wicked%Nfeelings.%K%P

0x234
While pretending to be calm, I sit down on a nearby stone%Nstaircase.%K%P

0x248
Izumi「Oh...」%K%P

0x254
Izumi「Just now, you were thinking something strange... weren't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x260
Makoto「N-No I wasn't!」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「Don't say such weird things!」%K%P

0x280
Izumi「Hmm... then that's fine...」%K%P

0x28C
Izumi-san sits down on the stairs with a suggestive smile.%K%P

0x298
Izumi「I wonder why...」%K%P

0x2A4
Izumi「When I'm with you, Makoto-kun, my heart is very calm...」%K%P

0x2B0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2BC
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you said it yesterday, didn't you?」%K%P

0x2C8
Izumi「'Is it really all right for us to stay this carefree?'」%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi「I also think that.」%K%P

0x2E0
Izumi「As a psychologist, I've been seriously worried, thinking%Nwe should be taking this problem more seriously.」%K%P

0x2EC
Izumi「But you know what?」%K%P

0x2F8
Izumi「On the other hand, there's also a 'me' who doesn't think%Nthat way...」%K%P

0x304
Izumi「There's a me who wishes to accept the reality before my%Neyes as it is.」%K%P

0x310
Izumi「... See... take a look.」%K%P

0x31C
As Izumi-san says this, she looks to the sky.%K%P

0x330
Izumi「The stars are shining today as well, right?」%K%P

0x33C
Izumi「Even now, Regulus... is continuing to shine...」%K%P

0x348
Izumi「What's more important than whether it's true or not is%Nwhether you can believe it or not.」%K%P

0x354
Izumi「That's... how it is...」%K%P

0x394
Izumi「Suddenly experiencing this strange phenomenon... If%Nyou weren't here, I think I would have lost my reason.」%K%P

0x3A0
Izumi「It's because you're here, Makoto-kun... That's why I've%Nreached the point where I can believe.」%K%P

0x3AC
Believe...%K%N

0x3B8
Something to believe in...%K%N

0x3C4
Just what is Izumi-san trying to believe in...?%K%P

0x3D8
Izumi「Oh, I'm so sorry.」%K%P

0x3E4
Izumi「I'm just rambling incoherently again, aren't I?」%K%P

0x3F0
Izumi「But I wanted to say it ahead of time... no matter what...」%K%P

0x3FC
Izumi「No matter what... before I began talking...」%K%P

0x408
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x424
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x430
Izumi「Please...」%K%P

0x43C
She mutters this like a sigh.%K%P

0x448
Izumi-san extends her right hand, and touches my cheek.%K%P

0x454
Her palm is soft...%K%P

0x460
My cheek, which is cold from the night breeze, warms up.%K%P

0x474
Izumi「Don't forget this warmth, all right?」%K%P

0x480
Izumi「Don't forget... my existence, all right?」%K%P

0x48C
I don't know... what Izumi-san wants to say.%K%P

0x498
However, only my left cheek feels like it's melting into her%Nwarmth.%K%P

0x4A4
Into her endless kindness...%K%P

0x4B0
Into the goddess'... embrace...%K%P

0x4BC
I feel the same peace as last time on my left cheek.%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi「... All right? ... Do you promise?」%K%P

0x4DC
I silently nod.%K%P

0x4E8
Izumi-san gently removes her palm,and places it on her%Nknee.%K%P

0x4F4
She slowly smooths out her skirt...%K%N

0x500
... And then speaks.%K%P

0x514
Izumi「Then shall we begin?」%K%P

0x520
Her voice echoes in the darkness, as if she were%Ndeclaring the start of a solemn ceremony.%K%P

0x578
Izumi「Schr▼dinger's cat.」%K%P

0x584
Izumi「The Third Trait of Cur▲ Syndrome.」%K%P

0x590
Izumi「Makoto-kun... do you know how these two are%Nconnected?」%K%P

0x59C
Makoto「E-Even if you suddenly ask me that, there's no way that%NI'd know!」%K%P

0x5A8
Makoto「In the first place, I don't know a thing about The Third%NTrait...」%K%P

0x5B4
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0x5C0
Izumi「But you do know what Schr▼dinger's cat is, right,%NMakoto-kun?」%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「I didn't so much 'know' it as much as I 'learned' about it.」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「I heard about it today from Yuka...」%K%P

0x5E4
Izumi「From Yuka-chan?」%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x5FC
Izumi「And how did Yuka-chan explain it?」%K%P

0x608
Makoto「'How'... That's a bit difficult to summarize...」%K%P

0x614
Makoto「Just...」%K%P

0x620
Izumi「'Just'...?」%K%P

0x62C
Makoto「'Deciding the past'.」%K%P

0x640
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「No, that's... How do I put this?」%K%P

0x658
Makoto「By opening the lid, you determine the cat's life or death%Nstatus...」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「In short, it's arranged so that the observer 'decides the%Npast'...」%K%P

0x670
Makoto「At least... that's what Yuka said...」%K%P

0x67C
Izumi「Yes... I see...」%K%P

0x688
Izumi「If that's the case, then the story will go faster.」%K%P

0x694
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x6A0
Izumi「In other words... it's like this.」%K%P

0x6AC
Izumi「The observer's intention decides the truth of the past.」%K%P

0x6B8
Makoto「The observer's intention???」%K%P

0x6C4
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0x6D0
Makoto「So is it like this, then?」%K%P

0x6DC
Makoto「When the lid is opened, the cat is alive if the observer%Nwishes 'I hope it's alive', but is dead if the observer%Nwishes 'I hope it's dead'.」%K%P

0x6E8
Izumi「No, that's not it.」%K%P

0x6F4
Izumi「That's not what I wanted to say.」%K%P

0x700
Izumi「In this case 'intention' refers to a simple 'motive' in order%Nto produce a certain act.」%K%P

0x70C
Izumi「'I want to confirm the cat's life or death status', so 'I want%Nto open the lid'...」%K%P

0x718
Izumi「It refers to the very fact that you 'think' so.」%K%P

0x724
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x738
Izumi「But you know what? What you said wasn't wrong either.」%K%P

0x744
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x750
Izumi「The observer's wish completely changing the truth of%Nthe past.」%K%P

0x75C
Izumi「There's a phenomenon described as such that's%Nactually been published as a thesis.」%K%P

0x768
Izumi「The name of the person who wrote that thesis―is%NMichael Cabin.」%K%P

0x774
Makoto「What!? That's the man who counseled Tom...」%K%P

0x780
Izumi「Yes... the very same Dr. Cabin.」%K%P

0x78C
Makoto「Then, The Third Trait of Cur▲ Syndrome is-」%K%P

0x7A0
Izumi「Wait!」%K%P

0x7B4
Izumi「We'll talk about that later...」%K%P

0x7C0
Izumi「If I don't explain things in order, I think you'll probably get%Nconfused.」%K%P

0x7CC
Makoto「O-Okay...」%K%P

0x7E0
Izumi「Okay, Makoto-kun? Listen carefully.」%K%P

0x7EC
Izumi「While Dr. Cabin's counseling progressed, he%Nexperienced a certain astounding phenomenon.」%K%P

0x7F8
Izumi「It was something that defied common knowledge... an%Nabnormal phenomenon...」%K%P

0x804
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x810
Izumi「At the same time, there was a certain terminal cancer%Npatient hospitalized in the ward of the surgical%Ndepartment in the hospital Dr. Cabin worked at.」%K%P

0x81C
Izumi「Her name was Julia, a girl who had only just turned twelve%Nyears old...」%K%P

0x828
Izumi「Her cancer had already spread all around her body, and%Nher case was considered already beyond help.」%K%P

0x844
Izumi「But... one day, all of the sudden, an unusual event%Noccurred.」%K%P

0x850
Izumi「The malignant tumor that should have been spreading%Nthroughout her body suddenly disappeared without a%Ntrace.」%K%P

0x85C
Izumi「Even with X-rays and CAT scans, not even a single%Ntrace of the cancer could be found.」%K%P

0x868
Izumi「In other words, Julia's illness had been completely cured.」%K%P

0x874
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x880
Izumi「Although the doctors in charge of her were completely%Nbewildered by this miraculous event...」%K%P

0x88C
Izumi「'The treatments we selected probably succeeded.'...%NThey delighted themselves with thoughts like that.」%K%P

0x898
Izumi「But the story didn't just end there.」%K%P

0x8A4
Izumi「For some reason, for the rest of that day, the%Nhospitalized patients' illnesses were cured one after%Nanother.」%K%P

0x8B0
Izumi「It wasn't just cancer...」%K%P

0x8BC
Izumi「Heart diseases, strokes, liver cirrhosis, kidney failure,%Ndiabetes mellitus, infections, aneurysms, stomach%Nulcers, and even pneumonia...」%K%P

0x8C8
Izumi「Every single kind of illness was completely cured without%Nwarning.」%K%P

0x8D4
Izumi「The miracle spread in the blink of an eye, like it was some%Nkind of virus infecting them all.」%K%P

0x8E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x910
Izumi「Makoto-kun... You understand what I've said so far, right?」%K%P

0x91C
Izumi「Why this miracle happened, that is...」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「It couldn't be... the 'Immortality Contagion'... could it?」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Through some trigger, Tom touched Julia...」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「From there, the 'Immortality Contagion' spread around the%Nhospital in the blink of an eye...?」%K%P

0x94C
Izumi「That's right.」%K%P

0x958
Izumi「Julia and Tom, who became the origins of this contagion,%Nwere acquaintances.」%K%P

0x964
Izumi「To put it simply, they were childhood friends... They might%Neven have loved each other.」%K%P

0x970
Izumi「Anyway, Tom frequently visited Julia's hospital room.」%K%P

0x97C
"I want to cure her illness."%K%P

0x988
"And I have a miraculous ability that will enable me to do%Nthat."%K%P

0x994
Izumi「And one day, Tom, who believed that, gently touched%NJulia's forehead...」%K%P

0x9A0
Izumi「Everything began from there.」%K%P

0x9AC
Izumi「When Dr. Cabin noticed this, he discussed it with his%Nfellow doctors.」%K%P

0x9B8
Izumi「However, the doctors didn't listen to such a strange,%Noccult-like story.」%K%P

0x9C4
Izumi「In the end, Dr. Cabin decided to investigate the origin of%N'Cure'―the phenomenon known as the 'Immortality%NContagion'―all alone.」%K%P

0x9D0
Izumi「Before long, several months had passed, and Dr. Cabin%Nfinally reached a hypothesis.」%K%P

0xA38
"If you were to define the symptoms of a delusion that%Nspreads from person to person as some kind of shared%Npsychotic disorder, then you could liken the contents%Nof the delusion in regards to that mental illness to that%K%Pof a living creature."%K%P

0xA44
"Said creature, which is created in a single person's%Nmind due to a mutation, may reproduce and spread into%Nother people's consciousnesses one after the other%Nby feeding off the validity of its existence, as well as%K%Pthe intentions of people who desire for its existence."%K%P

0xA58
"Hence, the more suitable the historical background the%Ncreature is born into and the more powerful the desires%Nof the people at that time, the stronger its vitality, or%Nintensity, grows."%K%P

0xA6C
"Incidentally, the greatest natural enemy to this living%Ncreature's ability to propagate is common sense."%K%N%N

0xA78
"Once this creature obtains the vitality to eliminate%Ncommon sense, it appears as a new reality for the first%Ntime."%K%N%N

0xA84
"Is it perhaps possible that the religious miracles%Ncirculated all over the world can also be seen as the%Nquickening of this creature?"%K%P

0xA98
"People's consciousnesses (trust and strong desires%Ndue to validity) bring forth this creature as a reality."%K%N%N

0xAA4
"It might be possible for a strong thought (a delusion) to%Ncreate a new reality."%K%P

0xAFC
Izumi「In short, it's like this.」%K%P

0xB08
Izumi「First, a person lies.」%K%P

0xB14
Izumi「That lie is attractive enough to make people feel that%Nthey want to believe it.」%K%P

0xB20
Izumi「Furthermore, there's also definite proof of that lie.」%K%P

0xB2C
Izumi「For example, a miracle occurring in their presence, or%Nhaving actually experienced it themselves...」%K%P

0xB38
Izumi「Naturally, that's why the one being lied to also firmly%Nbelieve that it's the truth.」%K%P

0xB44
Izumi「More or less, to firmly believe means... that the lie is no%Nlonger a lie in that person's mind.」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「The delusion becomes fact, and fiction becomes reality...」%K%P

0xB5C
Makoto「In other words, by firmly believing in a lie, it can create a%Nwhole new reality?」%K%P

0xB70
Izumi「Yes, that's right...」%K%P

0xB7C
Izumi「And in Tom's case, it was 'I can infect others with%Nimmortality'... That was the first lie, his delusion.」%K%P

0xB88
Izumi「The patients sincerely believed in that delusion%Nwholeheartedly, and their own miracles occurred.」%K%P

0xB94
Izumi「Well, we don't know whether they really became immortal%Nor not... In any case, the only fact we can say for sure is%Nthat 'their illnesses were cured'.」%K%P

0xBA0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBB4
Izumi「Dr. Cabin then considered this.」%K%P

0xBC0
Izumi「The religious miracles from all ages and countries might%Nbe similar to this phenomenon.」%K%P

0xBCC
Izumi「―That's why it's Cur▲ Syndrome.」%K%P

0xBD8
Izumi「In French, the word 'cur▲' refers to a 'curate', or a%N'senior parish priest'.」%K%P

0xBE4
Makoto「So that's why he used the French word 'cur▲' instead of%Nthe English word 'cure'... Wait, then The Third Trait of Cur▲%NSyndrome is...」%K%P

0xBF8
Izumi「That's right...」%K%P

0xC04
Izumi「When delusions become truth.」%K%P

0xC10
Izumi「When a firm thought produces a new reality.」%K%P

0xC1C
Izumi「That's The Third Trait...」%K%P
