Before Okuhiko wakes up, I first awaken Yuka and Haruka.%K%P

0x114
Next, I call Kurumi and Saki.%K%P

0x120
Everyone gathers for a meeting past 9:15 A.M.%K%P

0x12C
Okuhiko is scheduled to wake up at 9:34 A.M., so we don't%Nhave a moment to waste.%K%P

0x138
Once everyone is gathered, I lay out the details of my%Nplan in simple terms.%K%P

0x168
Yuka「Heh～, sounds like fun!」%K%P

0x17C
Kurumi「Sounds good♪ Let's do it!」%K%P

0x188
Everyone's in agreement. That's reassuring.%K%P

0x194
Makoto「Ah... but now that I think about it carefully, college is%Nstarting up again...」%K%P

0x1A8
Yuka「It's fine, it's just college... Let's skip it!」%K%P

0x1B4
Yuka says this ridiculous statement with a straight face.%K%P

0x1C0
Now that I think about it, she did say "I don't want to go%Nback to my normal life" at one point, didn't she...?%K%P

0x1DC
Saki「I'm good too. I want to see Okuhiko-kun go through a%Npainful experience of his own...」%K%P

0x1E8
Saki's all fired up about this.%K%P

0x1F4
Well, Okuhiko did manage to ignite Saki's wrath due to his%Nown actions...%K%P

0x208
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x214
Haruka says nothing. I guess she fine either way?%K%P

0x220
After all, the others didn't seem to oppose to Okuhiko's%Nplan to deceive me.%K%P

0x23C
Kurumi「Huu―h!? What about Kurumi? There's no way that%NKurumi can skip school!」%K%P

0x250
Izumi「Hmm... Then you'll just be have to drop out of the plan...」%K%P

0x25C
Kurumi complains, but when Izumi-san says, "I'll tell you%Neverything that happened when I get back", she agrees.%K%P

0x280
Makoto「Very well then. Commence the operation!」%K%P

0x2D4
There are now only ten minutes left until Okuhiko wakes%Nup.%K%P

0x2E0
We rush to make the preparations.%K%P

0x2EC
Fortunately, it seems Okuhiko had made his own%Npreparations, as he's already set all the clocks (and%Nanything that shows the date) in the lodge so that they%Nread April 1st.%K%P

0x2F8
He's so methodical that he also changed his own watch%Nso that it says the 1st.%K%P

0x304
After checking everything in the loft, I snicker as I%Nobserve the sleeping Okuhiko, who's making such an%Nidiotic face.%K%P

0x310
I feel no pity for him for the hell he's about to go%Nthrough... Not a bit.%K%P

0x32C
Makoto「Crap!」%K%P

0x338
Just then, I remember something important.%K%P

0x344
Makoto「The TV... What should we do about the TV? When Yuka was%Ncooking, we were watching shows on TV!」%K%P

0x358
Yuka「What!? Why were you watching it!?」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「What else were we supposed to do!? Anyway, the shows%Nwill be different, so it'll be clear that it's not the 1st from%Nthe TV...」%K%P

0x39C
Haruka「It's not a problem...」%K%P

0x3A8
Haruka「I recorded it...」%K%P

0x3B4
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x3C0
Everyone looks at Haruka in puzzlement.%K%P

0x3CC
Well, normally, you wouldn't think to record local%Nbroadcasting shows...%K%P

0x3D8
Haruka「I recorded... 'A Healthy YOUtopia'... and then I accidentally%Nleft it running.」%K%P

0x3FC
I don't really get it, but it seems that thanks to Haruka,%Nwe've been saved from this dilemma.%K%P

0x408
Afterwards, everyone goes to where they're supposed%Nto be.%K%P

0x414
Izumi-san and Kurumi go to Lunabeach.%K%N

0x420
As soon as the seafood pizza is done, Kurumi will deliver%Nit here.%K%P

0x42C
Saki is on standby at her summer house.%K%N

0x438
Haruka and I are in the living room together.%K%P

0x444
When Izumi-san leaves for the lodge, she throws me a%Ngentle smile.%K%P

0x450
"Good luck."%K%P

0x45C
Her encouraging look seems to tell me this.%K%P
