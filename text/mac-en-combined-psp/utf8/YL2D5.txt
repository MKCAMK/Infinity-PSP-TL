After that, we left the barbecue in a cheerful mood, and%Nreturned to the lodge.%K%P

0x184
We were reluctant to break up at Princess Beach and%Nend the party...%K%P

0x190
Izumi「Well then, why don't we all go to the lodge and play%Ncards?」%K%P

0x19C
... So we decided to accept Izumi-san's proposal.%K%P

0x1A8
We had played so many rounds of seven bridge that we%Nhad lost track of time. In the end, everyone got tired and%Nfell asleep past two in the morning...%K%P

0x1B4
As usual, Haruka's in her own room, and Okuhiko is%Nsleeping up in the loft.%K%P

0x1C0
After the game was over, Saki returned to her summer%Nhouse alone while rubbing her sleepy eyelids.%K%P

0x1CC
Truth be told, it seems she wanted to stay overnight at%Nthe lodge with everyone, but unfortunately, there wasn't%Nenough room for her to sleep.%K%P

0x1D8
Izumi-san is using the living room sofa, and Kurumi took%Nmy bed when I wasn't paying attention.%K%P

0x1E4
So in the first place, even I don't have a place to sleep.%K%P

0x1F0
It looks like I'm sleeping on the hard floor tonight...%K%P

0x1FC
Oh, and as for Yuka...%K%P

0x278
She's next to me right now.%K%P

0x284
We're sitting on the floor of my room, our backs leaning%Nagainst the wall.%K%P

0x290
Kurumi is sleeping soundly in front of us, breathing%Nquietly.%K%P

0x29C
We're gazing at her peaceful sleeping face.%K%P

0x2A8
Yuka「But aren't you glad?」%K%P

0x2B4
Yuka whispers this without taking an eye off of Kurumi's%Nface.%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「About what?」%K%P

0x2CC
Yuka「About Kurumi-chan!」%K%P

0x2D8
Yuka「She played cards with us the whole time.」%K%P

0x2E4
Yuka「We didn't have to specifically watch out for her that way,%Nright?」%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「Well, yeah...」%K%P

0x2FC
Yuka「Judging from her sleeping face, I'm sure she won't wake%Nup until morning...」%K%P

0x308
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x314
Yuka「And we haven't gone back to that shrine this whole time,%Nright?」%K%P

0x320
Makoto「That's right...」%K%P

0x32C
Yuka「Feels like a 'happily ever after' is coming our way.」%K%P

0x338
Makoto「Hey... say what you like, but don't you think it's too early%Nto feel that way?」%K%P

0x344
Yuka「Really?」%K%P

0x350
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x35C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x368
Makoto「Just to be safe, why don't you stay with me tomorrow%Nnight?」%K%P

0x37C
Yuka「You don't... trust me...」%K%P

0x388
Makoto「It's not like that, but...」%K%P

0x394
Yuka「Then what is it like?」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「... I told you, it's just to be safe!」%K%P

0x3B4
Yuka「So you really don't trust me...」%K%P

0x3C0
Even in the darkness, I can tell that Yuka's annoyed.%K%P

0x3CC
Makoto「Just hold it right there...」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「How can you expect me to trust you when you were the%None who broke our promise on the last 6th in the first%Nplace?」%K%P

0x3E4
Yuka「That was...」%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「'Don't come here ever again'... even though you said that%Nin front of the shrine...」%K%P

0x40C
I am taken aback by my own words.%K%P

0x418
That's right! That's right, isn't it!?%K%P

0x424
Why did I forget about it up until now?%K%P

0x430
Was it because everything's been going so incredibly%Nwell... that I let myself get intoxicated with cheerfulness%Nand didn't realize I'd forgotten about it?%K%P

0x43C
Even though this was such a crucial element...%K%P

0x448
Even though this is the most important question...%K%P

0x454
This was the question in my mind that was bugging me%Njust before I fell asleep on the night of the 1st!%K%P

0x460
"Why did Yuka want to go back to the past!?"%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「Say, Yuka...? I still haven't heard it, have I?」%K%P

0x478
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x484
Makoto「Your reason for wanting to go back to the past...」%K%P

0x498
Yuka「... But... that's alread―」%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「I don't even know what it is...」%K%P

0x4B0
Makoto「You never even... told me...」%K%P

0x4BC
Yuka「I'm telling you, it doesn't-」%K%P

0x4C8
Makoto「Even so...」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Even so...」%K%P

0x4E0
Makoto「Even so, there's no way I can trust you!」%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「I don't know your reason at all!」%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「I have no guarantee that you won't go!!」%K%P

0x504
I'm finally able to let out some steam...%K%P

0x518
Kurumi「Mmm... Mmm...」%K%P

0x524
My shouting causes Kurumi to turn in the bed.%K%P

0x538
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x544
Yuka「You're horrible... Makoto...」%K%P

0x550
Horrible?%K%N

0x55C
I'm... horrible...?%K%P

0x568
Yuka「I get... I get it...」%K%P

0x574
Yuka「I'll tell you everything...」%K%P

0x588
Yuka says this, and slowly gets up.%K%P

0x594
Yuka「I don't... want to wake Kurumi-chan...」%K%P

0x5BC
Yuka quietly leaves the room.%K%P

0x5C8
I follow right after her...%K%P

0x650
Yuka sits down in the center of the short staircase that%Nleads to the terrace.%K%P

0x65C
I sit down next to her.%K%P

0x668
The biting cold night wind nips at my ears.%K%P

0x674
That wind makes the blood that's rushed to my head%Nsuddenly cool down.%K%P

0x680
I slightly regret yelling now...%K%P

0x68C
I look up at the night sky.%K%P

0x6A0
This is the second time I've seen this miracle.%K%P

0x6AC
This sparkling group... this tempest of stardust...%K%P

0x6B8
The countless stars shine brightly, as if they were%Nabout to burst.%K%P

0x6C4
My mind has calmed down, like the surface of water does%Nafter a ripple...%K%P

0x704
Yuka purses her lips, and looks at me.%K%P

0x710
Her eyes are misty, as if she's about to cry.%K%P

0x71C
She takes a deep breath, her thin shoulders trembling.%K%P

0x728
Yuka「I...」%K%P

0x734
Yuka「I wanted to go back to the past... no matter what...」%K%P

0x740
She speaks in a very quiet voice.%K%P

0x74C
A soft voice that feels like it's touching my heart...%K%P

0x758
Yuka「I realized it on the night of the 5th...」%K%P

0x764
Yuka「You and I went to the shrine... and talked about time%Ntravel...」%K%P

0x770
Yuka「After that, even when I returned to my room, I couldn't get%Nit out of my head the whole time...」%K%P

0x77C
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x788
Yuka「I turned in my bed countless times... and just when I%Nfinally felt like I was going to fall asleep... I suddenly%Nrealized it...」%K%P

0x794
Yuka「The meaning of those words...」%K%P

0x7A0
Yuka「The meaning of the words... written on the talisman...」%K%P

0x7AC
(The spring rain/ At the end of the cape/ Together with/%NThe echoing bell/ Will free you from time.)%K%P

0x7B8
Yuka「And before I knew it, it was pouring rain outside...」%K%P

0x7C4
Yuka「I headed for the end of the cape... while feeling the cold%Nsensation of the bell in my pocket with my fingertips...」%K%P

0x7D0
Yuka「I thought that if I did that, I'd surely return...」%K%P

0x7DC
Yuka「Because I wanted to go back... to that time...」%K%P

0x7E8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x7F4
Yuka「The first boy I loved...」%K%P

0x800
Yuka「He told me he loved me...」%K%P

0x80C
Yuka「But even so, I... I...」%K%P

0x818
Yuka「I still haven't told him...」%K%P

0x824
Yuka「I never told that boy my own feelings...」%K%P

0x830
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「Don't tell me that you...」%K%P

0x848
Yuka「... I wanted to tell him I love him!」%K%P

0x854
Yuka「I needed to tell him that no matter what!」%K%P

0x860
Yuka「If I didn't... If I didn't, I...」%K%P

0x86C
Makoto「For that purpose...」%K%P

0x878
Makoto「The only reason you did it was for that purpose...?」%K%P

0x884
Yuka「But that's already-」%K%P

0x890
Makoto「Don't screw with me!」%K%P

0x89C
Makoto「Then you're telling me that the only reason we've, no, I've%Ncontinued to be toyed with like this is because of your%Nselfish emotions!?」%K%P

0x8A8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x8B4
Makoto「These past ten days... no, it could be ten years or a%Nhundred years for all I know...」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「We've been stuck like this that whole time because of%Nyou recklessly acting upon such ridiculous and childish%Nemotions!」%K%P

0x8CC
Yuka「You're wrong...」%K%P

0x8D8
Makoto「Wrong? WRONG!? Then why don't you try telling me what%Nthe fuck I'm wrong about then!?」%K%P

0x8E4
Yuka「That's...」%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8FC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x908
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x914
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x920
Makoto「I get it... That's enough...」%K%P

0x92C
Makoto「That's enough... Nothing matters right now...」%K%P

0x938
Makoto「... What the hell...」%K%P

0x944
Makoto「... I've had... enough...」%K%P

0x958
I stand up while shaking my head.%K%P

0x964
I feel so exhausted.%K%P

0x970
Everything really doesn't matter anymore...%K%P

0x97C
At this point, I don't really even want to speak to Yuka.%K%P

0x988
I don't need to.%K%P

0x994
It's getting harder to breathe... I don't want to think about%Nanything...%K%P

0x9A0
I stagger as I climb up the stairs.%K%P

0x9AC
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x9B8
I hear her calling behind me.%K%P

0x9C4
However, I don't want to look at her face...%K%P

0xA28
When I return to my room, I lie down on the floor and close%Nmy eyes.%K%P

0xA34
I want to hurry up and fall asleep...%K%P

0xA40
At this point, I wouldn't even care if I fell asleep for%Neternity.%K%P

0xA4C
All I want to do is run away from this messed up reality...%K%P

0xA58
As if someone flipped a switch, I drift off to sleep the%Nmoment my eyes shut...%K%P

0xAB0
??「Makoto-kun! Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0xADC
Someone shakes my body, rousing me from my sleep.%K%P

0xAE8
Before my eyes is Saki.%K%P

0xAFC
Saki「Hey, how long are you going to sleep?」%K%P

0xB08
Saki「It's already afternoon!」%K%P

0xB14
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB20
Saki「Are you all right? Your face is really pale...」%K%P

0xB2C
Saki「Did something happen?」%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「... It's fine... leave me alone...」%K%P

0xB44
Saki「I can't leave you alone after seeing your face like this...」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB5C
Saki「Seriously, what's wrong?」%K%P

0xB68
Saki「Did you get into a fight with someone, perhaps?」%K%P

0xB74
Makoto「It doesn't matter anymore...」%K%P

0xB80
Makoto「It has nothing to do with you, Saki!」%K%P

0xB94
Saki「Hee hee...」%K%P

0xBA0
Saki「It's because you're trying to carry everything on your%Nshoulders like that...」%K%P

0xBAC
Saki「It's okay to talk to other people about your problems%Nsometimes.」%K%P

0xBB8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBCC
Saki「No comment again, huh...」%K%P

0xBD8
Makoto「Hey... I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood to talk to people%Nright now...」%K%P

0xBE4
Makoto「Leave me alone... please...」%K%P

0xBF8
Saki「Hee hee hee...」%K%P

0xC04
Saki「That part's exactly like him...」%K%P

0xC10
Saki「It's as if you two have a lifelike resemblance.」%K%P

0xC1C
(Lifelike resemblance...?)%K%P

0xC28
(Is she... is she talking about that bastard again!?)%K%P

0xC3C
Saki「I'm pretty sure I said this during the Test of Courage too,%Nbut...」%K%P

0xC48
Saki「Occasionally, at times when I see you act impulsively, it%Nfeels like you're just like that boy, if...」%K

0x1468
Stop talking about him!

0x1474
...

0xC90
Makoto「Stop talking about him!」%K%P

0xC9C
Saki「...」%K%P

0xCA8
Makoto「I don't want to hear about him ever again!!」%K%P

0xCB4
Saki「...」%K%P

0xCC0
Makoto「Get out...」%K%P

0xCCC
Makoto「Get out... Saki...」%K%P

0xD04
I roll into my bed, wrap myself in the covers, and plug my%Nears.%K%P

0xD10
I don't want to hear anything.%K%P

0xD1C
I don't want to think about anything.%K%P

0xD28
(I'm begging you, don't take me back to reality...)%K%P

0xD34
(I can only be at peace when I'm in this darkness...)%K%P

0xD40
Saki「M-Makoto-kun...? Hey, Makoto-kun...!?」%K%P

0xD4C
Her voice sounds distant.%K%P

0xD58
Once again, I take refuge in the everlasting world of%Nsleep...%K%P

0xD8C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD98
Saki「'If he were resurrected'... I find myself thinking that at%Ntimes.」%K%P

0xDA4
Makoto「... Resurrected!?」%K%P

0xDB8
Saki「Huh!? ... No way... you didn't know!?」%K%P

0xDC4
Saki quickly places her palm over her mouth.%K%P

0xDD0
Saki「... Should I not have said that?」%K%P

0xDDC
Makoto「What are you talking about!?」%K%P

0xDE8
Saki「...」%K%P

0xDF4
Makoto「Saki!?」%K%P

0xE08
Saki「... Ah, geez! But I've already let it slip, so it can't be%Nhelped!」%K%P

0xE14
Saki「In exchange... you absolutely need to keep this a%Nsecret from Yuka.」%K%P

0xE28
I give a silent nod.%K%P

0xE34
Saki stares off into space, hesitant about continuing.%K%P

0xE50
However... before long, she takes a deep breath, as if%Nshe's made a decision, and mutters this.%K%P

0xE78
Saki「That boy...」%K%P

0xE84
Saki「... is dead.」%K%P

0xE90
Makoto「D... Dead?」%K%P

0xE9C
Saki「Yeah...」%K%P

0xEA8
Saki「It was when we were in 9th grade... in June...」%K%P

0xEB4
Saki「We were staying at a hotel while on a field trip, when all of%Nthe sudden...」%K%P

0xEC0
Makoto「Wh-What...?」%K%P

0xECC
Saki「... There was a fire...」%K%P

0xED8
Makoto「A fire...」%K%P

0xEE4
Saki「It started in the office kitchenette on the main building's%Nthird floor...」%K%P

0xEF0
Saki「My group was fortunate enough to be staying towards%Nthe hotel's annex, so we managed to evacuate without%Nany problems, but...」%K%P

0xEFC
Saki「It was definitely... past 2:00 in the middle of the night...」%K%P

0xF08
Saki「The alarm suddenly rang, and we frantically ran out the%Nback...」%K%P

0xF14
Saki「When I looked up at the main building... part of the third%Nfloor was already a sea of flames...」%K%P

0xF20
Saki「No... it was more like... a wall of flames...」%K%P

0xF2C
Saki「... Do you understand why? It's because only the walls in%Nthe space between the second and fourth floors were%Nwrapped up in deep red flames...」%K%P

0xF38
Makoto「So you're telling me that that boy... was on the third floor?」%K%P

0xF44
Saki slowly shakes her head.%K%P

0xF50
Saki「Like my group, he was staying at the annex...」%K%P

0xF5C
Makoto「Then...」%K%P

0xF68
Saki「The ones in the main building... were Yuka's group...」%K%P

0xF74
Makoto「She wasn't in the same group as you!?」%K%P

0xF80
Saki「Right...」%K%P

0xF8C
Saki「Of course, there were other groups and kids from other%Nclasses in the main building, but...」%K%P

0xF98
Saki「It was just bad luck... only Yuka's group were staying in%Nrooms in the dead center of the fourth floor... it was too%Nlate to escape...」%K%P

0xFA4
Saki「The fourth floor was the top floor of the main building, so%Nthey couldn't escape by going up. On the other hand,%Nbelow them was that sea of flames...」%K%P

0xFB0
Saki「We could only watch and pray... as Yuka's group%Ndesperately waved their hands from the room's windows,%Nbegging for help...」%K%P

0xFBC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xFC8
Saki「But then... a lone, determined boy... went plunging into%Nthat fire...」%K%P

0xFD4
Saki「It was that boy...」%K%P

0xFE0
Saki「He kept going in and out of that blazing hellfire, helping%Ngirl after girl out one after another, his face drenched%Nwith sweat the whole time...」%K%P

0xFEC
Saki「And then... he brought out the last one...」%K%P

0xFF8
Saki「He held Yuka in his arms as he staggered out of the%Nentryway... then lost the last of his strength... and died...」%K%P

0x1004
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1010
Saki「He kept going in and out of that building with almost no%Noxygen over and over again...」%K%P

0x101C
Saki「It was perhaps a miracle that he managed to save all the%Nmembers of that group...」%K%P

0x1028
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1034
Saki「I only heard about this part afterwards, but...」%K%P

0x1040
Saki「As that boy held Yuka in his arms, he spoke his last%Nwords...」%K%P

0x1078
... ...%K%P

0x1084
Boy「Yuka... all this time... I've...」%K%P

0x1090
Boy「... I've loved you...」%K%P

0x109C
... ...%K%P

0x10B0
For a while, I can't think about anything.%K%P

0x10BC
No, I don't want to think about anything.%K%P

0x10C8
That shocking truth feels like it just punched me in the%Ngut.%K%P

0x10D4
―I'm similar to that boy...%K%P

0x10E0
―How ironic...%K%P

0x10EC
I suddenly get dizzy, and I feel a pain in my head as if my%Nbrain tissues were oozing pus.%K%P

0x10F8
Strength begins to vanish from my body...%K%P

0x1114
Saki「M-Makoto-kun...? Hey, Makoto-kun...!?」%K%P

0x1120
Her voice sounds distant.%K%P

0x112C
Once again, I fall into an endless void of darkness...%K%P

0x1194
When my eyes suddenly open, my surroundings are%Nalready pitch black.%K%P

0x11A0
I don't even have the energy to raise my arm to check%Nmy watch.%K%P

0x11AC
...%K%P

0x11B8
(That daring and resolute boy, and me, a coward.)%K%P

0x11C4
My heart feels as if its being crushed.%K%P

0x11D0
Although that boy put his life on the line to save Yuka%Nand the other girls...%K%P

0x11DC
I hesitated for one instant.%K%P

0x11E8
In that instant, I was thinking first and foremost about a%Nway for myself to survive.%K%P

0x11F4
That's why I couldn't protect Yuka in time...%K%P

0x1200
Yuka and Saki are making a tremendous%Nmisunderstanding by saying I'm similar to that boy.%K%P

0x120C
I'm not that much of a wonderful person.%K%P

0x1218
Don't say that we're similar...%K%N

0x1224
Don't condemn me that far...%K%P

0x1230
... That boy died telling Yuka that he loved her.%K%P

0x123C
But in the end, Yuka was unable to convey her feelings.%K%P

0x1248
That's why... she tried to go back to the past...%K%P

0x1254
Even so, I... said those horrible things.%K%P

0x1260
Makoto「We've been stuck like this that whole time because of%Nyou recklessly acting upon such ridiculous and childish%Nemotions!」%K%P

0x126C
I writhe in my bed.%K%P

0x1278
I hold my head, and tear at my chest.%K%P

0x1284
As time goes by, the pain only increases.%K%P

0x1290
I tightly shut my eyes, and continue to tremble in the%Ndarkness...%K%P
