I pursue Izumi-san in the intense rain.%K%P

0xF8
For some reason, I feel strangely uneasy.%K%P

0x104
(I have to hurry!) —I urge myself forwards.%K%P

0x164
I arrive out on the coastline road, and look around.%K%P

0x170
—Found her!%K%P

0x17C
I see Izumi-san's small, retreating figure.%K%P

0x188
She's running to the west.%K%P

0x194
I run after her with all my strength, kicking off the wet%Nasphalt...%K%P

0x1F4
Even when I enter the forest path, Izumi-san's speed still%Nhasn't dropped a bit.%K%P

0x200
I run up the hill road as fast as I can.%K%P

0x20C
Izumi-san hasn't looked back once.%K%P

0x218
Despite that, she desperately runs, as if she knows I'm%Nchasing her.%K%P

0x224
I'm unable to close the distance between us.%K%P

0x268
Izumi-san finally stops just as she arrives in the vicinity%Nof the lodge.%K%P

0x29C
Izumi「Stay away!」%K%P

0x2A8
When she notices me, Izumi-san shouts.%K%P

0x2B4
And once again, she goes running off...%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x31C
Izumi-san pushes through the deep thicket while%Nretreating deep into the forest.%K%P

0x328
However, as a result, she slows down.%K%P

0x334
I use this opportunity to quickly catch up to her and%Ncling to her arm.%K%P

0x354
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x360
I tug at her arm, forcing her to turn her around.%K%P

0x36C
Izumi「... Why did you chase after me?」%K%P

0x394
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3A0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x3AC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3B8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x3D0
Makoto「I'm sorry... I went way too far earlier.」%K%P

0x3DC
When I mutter these words, Izumi-san shakes her head.%K%P

0x400
Izumi「Makoto-kun, it was reasonable for you to blame me. It's%Nonly natural that you said those things.」%K%P

0x40C
Izumi「I don't care how badly you think about me.」%K%P

0x420
Izumi「... But... I want you to believe this, if nothing else.」%K%P

0x42C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x438
Izumi「The one thing I couldn't lie about... were my feelings...」%K%P

0x468
Izumi「I love you, Makoto-kun... If nothing else, I want you%Nbelieve... my feelings.」%K%P

0x474
I stare into Izumi-san's eyes.%K%P

0x480
Izumi-san is also looking straight into my eyes.%K%P

0x48C
I can't feel anything that makes it seem like she's lying in%Nthat serious gaze or hers.%K%P

0x498
I remember her words from two nights ago...%K%P

0x4A4
"But... it seems that in spite of that troublesome%Npersonality of yours..."%K%P

0x4B0
"I've fallen in love with you..."%K%P

0x4BC
My blood is boiling.%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「... Then why...?」%K%P

0x4E4
Makoto「Why did you cooperate with them to do all these%Nridiculous things...?」%K%P

0x4F8
Izumi「That's because of...」%K%P

0x504
Then, just as Izumi-san starts to say that...%K%P

0x510
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x51C
Kurumi「Onee-chan!」%K%P

0x528
... I can hear Okuhiko and the others' voices from behind%Nme.%K%P

0x534
I turn around.%K%P

0x55C
In that instant, my attention slips from Izumi-san to the%Nothers.%K%N

0x570
At that time, Izumi-san shakes off my grip.%K%P

0x584
Izumi「I'm so sorry...」%K%P

0x5D0
Izumi-san takes off again.%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「WAIT!!」%K%P

0x5E8
I pursue her.%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi-san steadily advances through the forest.%K%P

0x600
She pushes her way through the plants while heading%Ntowards a treetop that's sticking out...%K%P

0x62C
—But in the blink of an eye!%K%P

0x638
Izumi「!!!」%K%P

0x644
Izumi-san... ... disappears.%K%P

0x650
It's as if she's been spirited away...%K%P

0x678
Makoto「I... Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x684
I run up to the spot where Izumi-san disappeared.%K%P

0x6BC
The ground there is a steep slope slanted downwards.%K%P

0x6C8
In other words... I've come across the farthest end of%Nthe forest...a cliff.%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「No way... no way...」%K%P

0x6E0
I quickly get down on my hands and knees, and slide%Ndown the cliff.%K%P

0x734
I turn my head and survey my surroundings.%K%P

0x740
I find Izumi-san lying a short bit away from me.%K%P

0x74C
Makoto「I... Impossible...」%K%P

0x758
I stagger through the soft mud as I try to run towards%NIzumi-san.%K%P

0x764
(I'm definitely making a misunderstanding about this...)%K%P

0x770
I tell this to myself...%K%P

0x7EC
Izumi-san's cold body is stretched out in the soaking%Nwet mud...%K%P

0x7F8
She... isn't moving.%K%P

0x804
Her heavily dangling palm is clutching onto a small%Nfragment of light.%K%P

0x820
—A bell.%K%P

0x82C
It's that bell...%K%P

0x838
As soon as I see it, I suddenly remember something.%K%P

0x844
Kurumi's words from when we went to see the crab sumo...%K%P

0x850
—"Kurumi just picked up something a little%Ninteresting."%K%P

0x85C
And yesterday, at Lunabeach, Izumi-san told me...%K%P

0x868
—"This morning, I got a present from Kurumi...%NAccording to her, it seems she found it on Princess%NBeach."%K%P

0x874
(Kurumi found this bell... on Princess Beach...)%K%P

0x880
Before long... the bell begins to quietly slip out of the%Npalm...%K%P

0x88C
... It then... 119 :%W%W%W%W

0x8B4
... slips out and falls.%K%P

0x8F4
I tearfully cling to Izumi-san's back as my body's%Ntrembling gradually intensifies.%K%P

0x900
In my arms, I can feel her cold, wet skin...%K%P

0x90C
Looking at her ghastly pale, almost transparent cheeks,%NI feel like she might shatter into a thousand pieces if I%Ntouched her cheek.%K%P

0x918
As if she were a doll made of glass.%K%P

0x934
Izumi「... So please... For this short time, let me love you...」%K%P

0x940
Izumi-san's painful words come back to me...%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「Izumi... san...」%K%P

0x958
Now I finally realize it.%K%P

0x964
Izumi-san wasn't the only one lying.%K%P

0x970
I was also deceiving Izumi-san.%K%P

0x97C
It was because I was scared.%K%P

0x988
The goddess' words were simply way too kind for me...%K%P

0x994
I was unable to honestly accept them...%K%P

0x9A0
(I also... felt the same for Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x9AC
(... I loved her!)%K%P

0x9B8
Why... didn't I tell her?!%K%P

0x9D4
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0x9FC
My hoarse voice alone fills this empty void.%K%P

0xA08
My sadness and self loathing rapidly become more and%Nmore profound.%K%P

0xA14
This hot rage overwhelms me and brutally snatches%Naway my sense of reasoning.%K%P

0xA20
I feel as if I've lost my sense of self.%K%P

0xA48
In the middle of the pelting rain...%K%P

0xA54
... I soon... lose consciousness...%K%P
