Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x7C
Okuhiko's already there.%N

0x88
He's lounging on the sofa, smoking...%K%N

0x94
... Smoking a cigarette?%K%P

0xA0
Up until now, I've never seen Okuhiko in the middle of%Nsmoking.%K%P

0xAC
But none of that matters right now!%K%P

0xB8
I briskly walk over to Okuhiko, suddenly grab him by the%Ncollar, and force him to get up to his feet.%K%P

0xCC
Okuhiko「Wh-What the hell are you doing, Ishihara...」%K%P

0xD8
Makoto「Shut up! Just shut your mouth and answer my question!」%K%P

0xE4
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0xF0
Makoto「What's today's date?」%K%P

0xFC
Okuhiko「... Huh?」%K%P

0x108
Makoto「I'm asking you what today's date is!」%K%P

0x11C
Okuhiko「I-Ishihara... Are you joking?」%K%P

0x154
Makoto「Answer the goddamn question!!」%K%P

0x160
Okuhiko「... It's... April... 1st...」%K%P

0x16C
(That's... impossible...)%K%P

0x178
Makoto「Hey, Okuhiko? I've got one other question for you.」%K%P

0x184
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x190
Makoto「What happened to Kurumi?」%K%P

0x19C
Okuhiko「... K-Kurumi? Kurumi... Wait, isn't that the Japanese word%Nfor chestnut?」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「Don't play dumb!」%K%P

0x1E0
Okuhiko「I-I'm not playing dumb! Why don't YOU tell me what this%N'Kurumi' is, then!?」%K%P

0x1EC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1F8
My mind is still full of confusion.%K%N

0x204
I can't take in the meaning of Okuhiko's words very well.%K%P

0x210
Today is April 1st...%K%N

0x21C
If it's the morning of April 1st, then that means Okuhiko%Nhasn't met Kurumi yet, right...?%K%P

0x230
Okuhiko「A-Are you all right, Ishihara...?」%K%P

0x260
I thrust Okuhiko away, and rush out the front door as%Nswift as a tornado.%K%P

0x2D0
I've decided on my destination.%K%N

0x2DC
Obviously, it's Lunabeach.%K%N

0x2E8
First, I've got to confirm Kurumi's safety.%K%P

0x330
Today is April 1st...%K%N

0x33C
There's no way I can believe that.%K%N

0x348
Thinking about it realistically, it's completely impossible.%K%P

0x354
In my brain, I've got clear memories from the 1st to the 6th.%K%P

0x360
Are those memories false...?%K%N

0x36C
Was everything a dream...?%K%N

0x378
No, that's also probably not right.%K%P

0x384
Then just what is "today"?%K%N

0x390
... I don't know.%K%N

0x39C
I don't know, but...%K%P

0x3D4
... If today really is the 1st, then...%K%N

0x3E0
Then that means Kurumi's... still alive.%K%N

0x3EC
Kurumi's... alive.%K%P

0x3F8
She might be alive.%K%P

0x404
If such a miracle exists, then...%K%N

0x410
If such a miracle turns out to have really happened,%Nthen...%K%P

0x41C
Ah... I don't know what I'll do. I might be so happy that I'll%Ncry.%K%P

0x428
I pray that my watch and Okuhiko's words tell the truth.%K%P

0x434
(Please... be alive... Kurumi...!)%K%P

0x440
Unable to hold back my thriving emotions, I kick off the%Nasphalt and break off into a run...%K%P

0x488
I've arrived in front of Lunabeach.%K%N

0x494
My heart is pounding like crazy.%K%P

0x4A0
(Calm down... calm down...)%K%P

0x4AC
I tell this to myself.%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「Whew...」%K%P

0x4C4
I take three deep breaths.%K%P

0x4D0
... I place a hand on my chest...%K

0x4DC
... and slowly...%K%N

0x4E8
... open...%K

0x4F4
... the door to Lunabeach...%K%P

0x524
Izumi「Welcome～♪」%K%P

0x530
It's Izumi-san, who's the same as always...%K%P

0x53C
Makoto「Umm...」%K%P

0x548
Izumi「Yes?」%K%P

0x554
Makoto「... Is Kurumi... here?」%K%P

0x560
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x56C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x578
Izumi「Um... pardon me, but whom might you be?」%K%P

0x5A0
(I... Izumi... san...)%K%P

0x5AC
She sounds so distant...%K%N

0x5B8
That reserved manner... that formal tone...%K%N

0x5C4
This isn't the normal Izumi-san.%K%P

0x5D0
Complex emotions sprout within me. I'm trying, but I can't%Ncalm myself down.%K%P

0x5DC
There is almost no doubt in my mind that today is April 1st.%K%P

0x5E8
Meaning that Kurumi is really alive...%K%N

0x5F4
But...%K%N

0x600
But...%K%P

0x654
Kurumi「Oh, welcome～♪」%K%P

0x660
Makoto「KURUMI!!!」%K%P

0x66C
When I notice her, I shout.%K%P

0x680
Kurumi「... Y-Yes?」%K%P

0x68C
I instinctively want to embrace her.%K%N

0x698
I want to hug her tightly, and never let go...%K%P

0x6A4
I want to feel her soft hair in my hands.%K%N

0x6B0
I want to feel those small li... no, her nearly transparent%Nskin.%K%N

0x6BC
But...%K%P

0x6C8
Makoto「N-No... i-it's nothing.」%K%P

0x6F8
... I clench my fists tightly and resist those impulses.%K%N

0x704
Izumi-san's suspicious glare is piercing me.%K%N

0x710
She is examining me from head to toe.%K%P

0x71C
Izumi「Kurumi... is he an acquaintance of yours?」%K%P

0x728
Kurumi「Nope... never seen him before.」%K%P

0x734
Kurumi's words are the finishing blow...%K%N

0x740
It feels like I've been struck hard in the gut...%K%P

0x74C
Of course, it's not like this was "completely%Nunexpected," but... actually hearing those words is very%Npainful.%K%P

0x758
―Should I tell them the truth?%K%N

0x764
No, even if I did, that'd be pointless...%K%N

0x770
There's absolutely no way they'd believe me.%K%P

0x77C
It's better that we remain close acquaintances...%K%N

0x788
It's better if we can spend the next six days together%Nas friends...%K%P

0x794
Because right now, to the Morino sisters, I'm just... ...%NNothing more than a stranger.%K%P

0x7A0
Izumi「Why do you know about Kurumi?」%K%P

0x7AC
Izumi-san's gaze is still filled with suspicion.%K%P

0x7B8
Makoto「... I just... heard a rumor...」%K%P

0x7C4
I'm lying through my teeth. But I have no other options%Nright now.%K%P

0x7D8
Izumi「A rumor?」%K%P

0x7E4
Makoto「That there was a girl named 'Kurumi' at this shop who's an%Nexpert at origami... That's what I heard.」%K%P

0x7F0
Izumi「Origami...」%K%P

0x7FC
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x808
Izumi-san and Kurumi exchange glances.%K%P

0x814
Izumi「Ah... then did you hear that from Gen-san?」%K%P

0x820
Gen-san the fisherman, huh...?%K%P

0x82C
Makoto「... Gen-san? ... Oh, so that man's name was Gen-san?」%K%P

0x838
I'll go along with that.%K%P

0x84C
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x860
Izumi「Kurumi, you gave Gen-san, the fisherman, one of those%Norigamis you folded, remember...?」%K%P

0x874
Kurumi「Ah... you mean that fisherman...?」%K%P

0x880
Kurumi「Yep, yep. Kurumi folded a tuna and a whale shark and%Ngave it to him!」%K%P

0x894
Izumi「Gen-san would definitely have spread a rumor about%Nthat around the island... That's just the kind of person he%Nis.」%K%P

0x8A0
Kurumi「Hmm... so that's it...」%K%P

0x8B4
Izumi「Well, it's good publicity for this place, so I'm happy about%Nit...」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「... Well then... please excuse me.」%K%P

0x8D4
Izumi「Huh? Are you leaving?」%K%P

0x8E0
Makoto「Yes... I just remembered that there's something I have to%Ndo...」%K%P

0x8EC
Izumi「I see... that's unfortunate...」%K%P

0x900
Izumi「Well then, the next time you're free, would you come here%Nto eat?」%K%P

0x90C
Makoto「Yes... I'll definitely come back! ... Sometime in the near%Nfuture!」%K%P

0xA54
I decide not to return to the lodge yet.%K%N

0xA60
Before that, I need to sort out the confusion in my mind.%K%P

0xA6C
I begin to think as I walk...%K%N

0xA78
...%K%P

0xAA0
Kurumi is alive―finding that out was the happiest%Nmoment of my life.%K%P

0xAAC
I'm so ecstatic that it feels as if every fiber of my being%Nis dancing in joy.%K%P

0xAB8
But...%K%N

0xAC4
... At the same time, I can't get rid of this profound feeling%Nof loneliness whirling around in my heart.%K%P

0xAD0
"Nope... never seen him before."%K%N

0xADC
Kurumi's words were incredibly painful...%K%P

0xAE8
(Why did this happen?)%K%P

0xAF4
I don't know the reason.%K%N

0xB00
I don't know the reason, but there's just two things I've%Nconfirmed.%K%P

0xB0C
―I time traveled.%K%N

0xB18
On that day... on that rainy morning, I leapt through time,%Nback into the past.%K%P

0xB24
That's why I'm re-experiencing the morning of the 1st%Nright now.%K%P

0xB30
And the other thing I've confirmed is...%K%N

0xB3C
―This is an infinite loop.%K%N

0xB48
This is definitely not the first time I've time traveled.%K%P

0xB54
The reason why I can say this is because of that%Nhopeless dream I had on the morning of the last 1st...%K%N

0xB60
That scene was exactly the same scene from%N"yesterday"...%K%P

0xB6C
If that's the case, then before the last loop, I must have%Nexperienced those same six days before.%K%P

0xB78
And if I take that to its logical conclusion, then they%Nhappened again before that, and before that... In other%Nwords, I've been living through those six days an infinite%Nnumber of times.%K%P

0xB84
And if I think about it conversely, then after this, those%Nsame six days will repeat endlessly for all of eternity...%K%P

0xB90
No... that's wrong...%K%N

0xB9C
... There's one very clear difference from the "me" of%Ntoday and the "me" of the last loop's 1st.%K%P

0xBA8
―My memories.%K%N

0xBB4
I clearly remember what happened in those last six%Ndays, don't I?!%K%P

0xBC0
In that case, then there's no way I'm gonna let history%Nrepeat itself!%K%N

0xBCC
That's right! With these hands, I can change history!%K%P

0xBD8
Why did I time travel?%K%N

0xBE4
The reason doesn't matter now.%K%P

0xBF0
All that matters is that this is my chance. This is my last%Nchance to cosign that repulsive history into oblivion.%K%P

0xBFC
I don't know if there'll be another 1st or not.%K%N

0xC08
For argument's sake, even if there is, I might not have my%Nmemories, just like the last loop.%K%P

0xC14
That's why this is my last chance...%K%P

0xC20
―I won't make the same mistake again!%K%N

0xC2C
―I will definitely protect Kurumi!%K%N

0xC38
―I won't let Kurumi's smile disappear!%K%P

0xCC4
(But even though I said I'll change history, what should I%Ndo first?)%K%P

0xCD0
Should I tell everyone I time traveled?%K%N

0xCDC
No, even if I told them, I don't think anyone would believe%Nme.%K%P

0xCE8
In order to make them believe, I would have no choice but%Nto tell them everything...%K%P

0xCF4
Doing that would mean having to tell Kurumi about those%Ntragic events that will happen soon.%K%P

0xD00
There's no way in hell...%K%N

0xD0C
"On the morning of April 6th, Kurumi died!"%K%N

0xD18
... that I can say something like that.%K%P

0xD24
I don't want to terrify Kurumi. Plus, what would Izumi-san%Nthink of me if I tell them...?%K%P

0xD30
I'll try to keep this quiet from everyone...%K%N

0xD3C
There's no way I can get the others involved in this.%K%N

0xD48
This is my problem and mine alone.%K%P

0xDB0
Well then... What's the quickest solution...?%K%P

0xDBC
Hold on...%K%N

0xDC8
In the first place, isn't this island a dangerous place?%K%P

0xDD4
Then what if I force Kurumi to come with me and take her%Naway from the island...?%K%N

0xDE0
... No, that won't work.%K%P

0xDEC
If my memory serves me right, on the last 1st, Izumi-san%Nsaid "There's high waves, so the boats can't leave,"...%K%N

0xDF8
Great...%K%P

0xE04
Then what should I do?%K%N

0xE10
What should I do?%K%N

0xE1C
What should I do?%K%P

0xE38
―!!!%K%N

0xE44
Something suddenly flashes through my mind...%K%N

0xE50
I immediately break off into a run...%K%P

0xEC4
―I'll destroy the shrine itself!%K%N

0xED0
I run up to the shrine.%K%N

0xEDC
I look up at its overbearing image from below.%K%P

0xEE8
Suddenly, the scene from yesterday surfaces to the%Nforefront of my mind...%K%P

0xEFC
Kurumi...%K%P

0xF10
I feel my anger being resurrected.%K%P

0xF1C
(Because of this...)%K%P

0xF28
(Because of this godforsaken shrine... Kurumi...!)%K%P

0xF34
My blood is boiling... As my anger rises, I channel it into%Npower, and kick one of the pillars as hard as I can.%K%P

0xF40
I launch an assault run, ramming the pillar with my%Nshoulders. I do this over and over again as I put all my%Nbody weight into smashing the pillar.%K%P

0xF4C
...%K%N

0xF58
But the building is undaunted. I've only succeeded in%Ncausing the dust that's accumulated on the pillars to%Nflutter down.%K%P

0xF64
Even though this shrine has deteriorated so intensely, I%Nsuppose that my strength alone can't compare to an%Nearthquake...%K%P

0xF70
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0xF7C
I heavily sigh.%K%N

0xF88
I droop my shoulders as I leave the shrine grounds in%Ndefeat.%K%P

0x1004
Wait... this is nothing to get so depressed over, is it?%K%N

0x1010
After all, I still have vivid memories from before.%K%P

0x101C
I know the future so well I could take it in my hands.%NChanging history will be simple, right?%K%P

0x1028
There's nothing to be scared of!%K%N

0x1034
The most important matter is to take away the true scar%Nthat lies inside Kurumi.%K%P

0x1040
This time, I have to completely cure her emotional scars...%K%P

0x104C
Furthermore, is it really true that Kurumi and Izumi-san%Naren't related by blood? ―I need to determine%Nwhether that's true or not.%K%P

0x1058
If possible, it'd be nice if I could prove that those two%Nare true sisters.%K%P

0x1064
If I can get that proof, then I can fill up those emotional%Nscars, ensuring that tragedy doesn't happen again!%K%P

0x1070
... Be that as it may, there's way too many things that I%Ndon't know right now.%K%P

0x107C
Well then, what should I do?%K%N

0x1088
I don't even need to think about it.%K%N

0x1094
I need to properly hear Izumi-san's story from beginning%Nto end.%K%P

0x10A0
If I do that, then I feel that I can settle everything.%K%N

0x10AC
What I should be doing right now is building up my%Nrelationship with Kurumi again right from square one.%K%P

0x10B8
I'll recreate all those many fun memories with her once%Nagain...%K%P

0x10C4
Until my time limit is up, I'll devote everything I have into%Ndoing that.%K%P

0x10E0
...%K%N

0x10EC
By the time I arrive at the lodge, I've completely calmed%Ndown...%K%P

0x117C
I open the front door, and enter the living room.%K%N

0x1188
Okuhiko is lying on the floor, and seems to be writhing in%Nsevere agony...%K%P

0x1194
Makoto「I'm back!」%K%P

0x11A0
I call out.%K%P

0x11AC
Yuka turns from washing the dishes in the kitchen as%Nshe happily hums a song.%K%P

0x11C0
Yuka「Geez... where did you go...?」%K%P

0x11CC
Yuka「We already ate breakfast, you know?」%K%P

0x11D8
I see... So that means Okuhiko became the victim of%NYuka's cooking this time...%K%N

0x11E4
I almost feel sorry for Okuhiko, who's writhing in pain on%Nthe floor.%K%P

0x11F0
(Huh? What about Haruka?)%K%P

0x11FC
I look around for her.%K%P

0x1208
... Haruka is brushing her teeth in front of the sink right%Nnow.%K%P

0x1214
Judging from her condition, Haruka seems to have%Nsafely escaped this time as well.%K%P

0x1254
Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Since I'm standing in front%Nof the door, I open it without thinking.%K%P

0x12E8
Kurumi「Thank you very much for your continued patronage～♪」%K%P

0x12F4
Makoto「K... Kurumi...!」%K%P

0x1300
I quickly glance at my watch―"11:32 A.M."%K%P

0x130C
That's right...%K%N

0x1318
I completely forgot... At this time, Kurumi delivered the%Npizza...%K%P

0x1324
Kurumi「Oh, you're that guy from earlier...」%K%P

0x136C
I turn my head around and glance at the others.%K%N

0x1378
Okuhiko is dying on the floor, Yuka is standing in the%Nkitchen, and Haruka is brushing her teeth.%K%P

0x1384
Fortunately, none of them can hear my conversation with%NKurumi.%K%P

0x13D4
Kurumi「So you're staying at this lodge...」%K%P

0x13E0
Makoto「Y-Yeah... well, for the time being...」%K%P

0x13EC
Kurumi「All right♪ Anyway, here's the seafood pizza you%Nordered～♪」%K%P

0x13F8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1404
Kurumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0x1410
Wh-What should I do...?%K%N

0x141C
Should I say "I never ordered anything like that," like last%Ntime...?%K%P

0x1428
Or should I try redirecting her to Saki's place...?%K

0x3AB0
"I didn't order that."

0x3ABC
Redirect her to Saki's place.

0x1468
I decide to stay faithful to history.%K%N

0x1474
In the first place, if I don't, then we won't meet Saki...%K%P

0x1480
Makoto「Seafood pizza? I never ordered anything like that...」%K%P

0x148C
I play dumb.%K%P

0x1498
Kurumi「What!?」%K%P

0x14A4
A disturbed expression clouds Kurumi's face as she%Nsearches through her pocket with her free hand until%Nshe pulls out a scrap of paper.%K%P

0x14B0
Kurumi「But the receipt definitely says you ordered a 'Seafood%NPizza', didn't you?」%K%P

0x14BC
(Well, that's certainly what it says on the receipt.)%K%P

0x14C8
As I think that...%K%P

0x14D4
Makoto「I'm telling you that that's not what I mean. You see, I didn't%Norder anything.」%K%P

0x14E0
Kurumi「But...」%K%P

0x14EC
Kurumi「... This is definitely the right address.」%K%P

0x14F8
As she says this, Kurumi shows me the receipt.%K%N

0x1504
I ignore it and answer.%K%P

0x1518
I really should just be nice and point out her mistake.%K%P

0x1524
Makoto「I think... that there's probably been a mistake.」%K%P

0x1530
I say this.%K%P

0x153C
Kurumi「What!?」%K%P

0x1548
A disturbed expression clouds Kurumi's face as she%Nsearches through her pocket with her free hand until%Nshe pulls out a scrap of paper.%K%P

0x1554
Kurumi「But the receipt definitely says you ordered a 'Seafood%NPizza', didn't you?」%K%P

0x1560
Makoto「I'm telling you that that's not what I meant. I think you were%Nsupposed to deliver this to that summer house from%Nearlier.」%K%P

0x156C
Kurumi「The summer house from earlier...?」%K%P

0x1578
Okay... So far, so good...%K%N

0x1584
I just need to pick my next words carefully so that it%Nseems like I don't know too much.%K%P

0x1590
Makoto「Right... The summer house from earlier...」%K%P

0x159C
Makoto「You might not have seen it, but there's this summer%Nhouse nearby that you should have passed earlier...」%K%P

0x15A8
Makoto「... I think that... you were supposed to deliver this pizza%Nthere instead...」%K%P

0x15B4
Kurumi「Huh???」%K%P

0x15C0
Makoto「Hey, Kurumi... chan? What's the name written where it says%N'receiver's address'?」%K%P

0x15CC
Kurumi looks at the receipt one more time.%K%P

0x15D8
Kurumi「A-S-A-K-U-R-A... it says Asakura.」%K%P

0x15E4
Makoto「Right? So as you see, there isn't anyone here named%NAsaku-」%K%P

0x15F0
Okuhiko「H-Hold it right there...」%K%P

0x1630
Okuhiko had walked over without me noticing it, and is%Ncurrently standing next to me.%K%P

0x163C
Okuhiko「Ah... thank you... for all your trouble.」%K%P

0x1648
Okuhiko「I'm... Okuhiko... Asakura.」%K%P

0x1654
Okuhiko says this in a pained voice.%K%P

0x1660
Okuhiko「So... where's the pizza?」%K%P

0x167C
Kurumi「R-Right...」%K%P

0x1698
Slightly flustered, Kurumi pulls out a thin box out of the%Nsilver bag.%K%P

0x16AC
Kurumi「Here is your order!」%K%P

0x16B8
Okuhiko takes the pizza as he staggers on unsteady%Nfeet, then proceeds to ask her...%K%P

0x16C4
Okuhiko「H... How much is it...?」%K%P

0x16D8
Kurumi「1200 yen.」%K%P

0x16E4
Okuhiko takes some money out of his pocket, and gives%Nit to Kurumi...%K%P

0x16F8
Kurumi「Thank you very much♪」%K%P

0x170C
... who then gives a deep bow before energetically%Nrunning off.%K%P

0x1718
Looking at Okuhiko's face from the side as he sees her%Noff, I notice just how ghastly pale it is.%K%P

0x1724
I can kinda understand where Okuhiko's coming from.%K%P

0x1730
Anybody would want to "clean their palette", so to%Nspeak, in order to get rid of the terrible taste left in their%Nmouths from bad food, such as Yuka's cooking...%K%P

0x173C
That's probably what his ulterior motive was this time...%K%P

0x17D0
After that...%K%N

0x17DC
The four of us finish eating the pizza, and head for the%Ntennis courts.%K%N

0x17F8
Okuhiko and Haruka head for Princess Beach while Yuka%Nand I end up playing tennis again.%K%N

0x1804
The reason is simple... I'm still sore from my loss to Yuka%Nlast time.%K%N%N

0x1810
―So this time, I will definitely have my revenge!!%K%N%P

0x1824
But despite my enthusiasm, the result is still the same%Ncrushing defeat I suffered last time...%K%N

0x1830
In the end, I realize that I'll never match up to Yuka.%K%N

0x183C
After the match, Yuka smiles very happily.%K%N

0x1848
When I look at that smile, I begin to think...%K%P

0x185C
And Haruka and I go to Princess Beach again...%K%N%N

0x1868
Once again, Haruka tells me that she has "no heart".%K%N%N

0x1874
When I hear those words, I vow to take Haruka fishing%Nagain this time.%K%P

0x1888
Her problem has nothing to do with her "heart."%K%N%N

0x1894
Whether she does or doesn't have a heart, Haruka still%Nhad a beaming smile on when we went fishing.%K%N%N

0x18A0
There's no way I can take away that happy time from her.%K%N

0x18AC
I've got to teach Haruka the fun of fishing one more time...%K%P

0x18C0
It's clear that I now have to change history.%K%N

0x18CC
I have to prevent that tragedy, no matter what it takes.%K%N

0x18D8
Still, it doesn't mean that I can just ignore all the girls%Nexcept Kurumi.%K%N%N

0x18E4
It may account to nothing, but I want everyone to be as%Nhappy as possible.%K%P

0x18F8
For example, there's the incident where Saki got%Nswallowed by a wave ―Since I know about it, there's%Nno way I can feign ignorance and watch it happen%Nagain.%K%N

0x1904
The same goes for Saki and Haruka's quarreling. I want to%Nchange that too, if possible.%K%N%N

0x1910
... Right now, I'm the only one who knows what will happen%Nin the future.%K%N

0x191C
I'm the only one who can change the future.%K%P

0x1930
In other words, it's all up to me whether everyone%Nbecomes happy or miserable.%K%N

0x193C
To put it rather dramatically, I guess I could say that, "I'm%Nthe one who holds everyone's fate in my hands."%K%N%N

0x1948
From now on, these next six, no, seven days will be%Nhappy ones...%K%N

0x1954
I will guide them to happiness...%K%P

0x1968
That might be the other important mission that has been%Nbestowed upon me.%K%N

0x1974
Embracing this newfound sense of purpose cheers me%Nup.%K%N

0x1980
I'm starting to feel more confident and brave...%K%P

0x19F8
Before long, the sun turns red.%K%P

0x1A04
The four of us met on the coastline road, and now we're%Nwalking alongside Moon Beach.%K%P

0x1A50
I hear a loud thud from behind me, causing me to turn%Naround.%K%N

0x1A5C
On the sandy beach is Haruka, who has hit the ground.%K%P

0x1A68
A cloud of dust soundlessly stirs up into the empty sky.%K%P

0x1A74
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0x1A80
I let out a sound that's a combination between a sigh%Nand a laugh.%K%N

0x1A8C
This no longer surprises me.%K%N

0x1A98
This is a natural event, after all...%K%P

0x1AA4
I walk over to the confused Haruka's side, grab her%Nhand, and then help her up.%K%P

0x1AB0
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x1ABC
I say this on purpose.%K%N

0x1AC8
I myself may not have realized it, but maybe I've%Nsubconsciously decided to allow myself to have a little%Nfun with this reality.%K%P

0x1AD4
As if nothing had happened, she gives me a curt nod in%Nreply.%K%P

0x1AE0
Her clear embarrassment that she's trying to hide... her%Nblushing cheeks... This is kinda nostalgic...%K%P

0x1AEC
As if trying to cover up her trembling, Haruka quickly%Ngets to her feet and moves past me.%K%P

0x1B10
Almost there...%K%N

0x1B1C
In just a short bit, our true reunion, no, our meeting, will%Noccur.%K%P

0x1B28
My heart is pounding.%K%P

0x1B34
I feel extreme ecstasy over the thought of finally being%Nable to tell her my own name.%K%P

0x1B40
I quickly look up to see the red western skies are%Nburning dark red.%K%P

0x1B68
The sound of the waves breaking on shore are gentler%Nthan a lullaby...%K%P

0x1BE8
Yuka「Oh, to think there'd be a caf▲ here...」%K%P

0x1C0C
Okuhiko「It's got pretty good taste.」%K%P

0x1C18
Kurumi「Huh? Could you be...」%K%P

0x1C24
Kurumi places her broom against the wall, and runs up to%Nus.%K%P

0x1C40
Kurumi「Umm... you're... the people who ordered the seafood%Npizza... right?」%K%P

0x1C54
Okuhiko「Huh...? R-Right, thanks for doing that...」%K%P

0x1C60
A crooked grin slowly emerges on Okuhiko's face.%K%P

0x1C7C
Yuka「Hmm... What's this? You two know her?」%K%P

0x1C88
Makoto「She's the girl... who delivered the pizza around noon.」%K%P

0x1C94
Yuka「Ah. Okay.」%K%P

0x1CA8
Kurumi「Eheheh... thank you very much for your continued%Npatronage♪」%K%P

0x1CB4
Yuka「Hey. Since we're just standing here talking, why don't we%Ntake a little rest here?」%K%P

0x1CC0
Now that I think about it, if Yuka hadn't proposed this,%Nthen Kurumi, Izumi-san, and Saki might never have met.%K%P

0x1CCC
When I think that, I find the flow of time truly amusing.%K%P

0x1CE8
Okuhiko「You're right, I'm a little tired from all that walking. Yeah,%Nlet's do that.」%K%P

0x1CFC
Kurumi「Ah, yeah, yeah. Do it～♪」%K%P

0x1D18
Yuka「Makoto? What about you?」%K%P

0x1D24
Makoto「I'm definitely okay with this!! I would have gone in even if%Nyou had said not to!!」%K%P

0x1D30
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x1D3C
Yuka tilts her head curiously, but then...%K%P

0x1D50
Yuka「Haruka? Are you okay with this?」%K%P

0x1D5C
... seeks Haruka's approval.%K%P

0x1D78
Haruka「I'll... I'll pass... I'll head on back.」%K%P

0x1D84
Makoto「Huh!? What are you saying, Haruka!? You can't do that!%NYou absolutely can't do that!」%K%P

0x1D90
I unintentionally lose my composure...%K%P

0x1D9C
Crap... when I regain my composure and think about it, I%Nremember that Haruka ended up going into Lunabeach in%Nthe end anyway.%K%P

0x1DA8
I didn't need to get so flustered over it.%K%P

0x1DC4
Yuka「Hey, Makoto? Why are you so anxious about going into%Nthis shop?」%K%P

0x1DD0
Yuka unexpectedly questions me.%K%P

0x1DDC
Makoto「Th-That's...」%K%P

0x1DF8
Kurumi「Because you promised, right?」%K%P

0x1E04
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1E10
Kurumi「This morning... 'I'll definitely come in the near future'.%NThat's what you promised, right?」%K%P

0x1E1C
Makoto「Y-Yeah... right, right, right, right, right!」%K%P

0x1E28
Yuka「So you went to this shop this morning, Makoto?」%K%P

0x1E34
Makoto「W-Well, yeah...」%K%P

0x1E40
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x1E4C
Makoto「So won't you come with us as well, Haruka?」%K%P

0x1E68
Haruka「... All right.」%K%P

0x1E74
After pondering it for a while, Haruka mutters her consent.%K%P

0x1E80
Kurumi「Well then, time to give you four a tour of Lunabeach♪」%K%P

0x1E8C
Kurumi guides us through Lunabeach's entrance.%K%P

0x1E98
(Whew... that was close...)%K%P

0x1F24
Kurumi「Onee-chan, we have customers～♪」%K%P

0x1F30
Izumi「What's this? It's rare for Kurumi to attract customers.」%K%P

0x1F3C
Yuka「Huh? You said 'Onee-chan', so does that mean you two%Nare... sisters?」%K%P

0x1F48
Kurumi「That's right. Onee-chan and Kurumi are true%Nblood-related sisters.」%K%P

0x1F54
Kurumi sticks out her chest and answers.%K%P

0x1F60
"True blood-related sisters,"...%K%P

0x1F6C
I suddenly become depressed.%K%P

0x1F78
It feels like something is crushing my heart...%K%P

0x1F84
Izumi「Oh♪ Now that I've gotten a closer look at you, I think%Nthat you're the one from this morning... I'm sorry, I never%Ngot your name.」%K%P

0x1F90
Makoto「... It's... Ishihara.」%K%P

0x1F9C
Izumi「Ishihara-kun...」%K%P

0x1FA8
Makoto「No, it's Makoto!」%K%P

0x1FB4
Izumi「Huh? ... O-Oh... then... Makoto Ishihara?」%K%P

0x1FC0
I silently nod.%K%P

0x1FCC
Izumi「'In the near future'... still, I didn't think you'd come back%Nthis quickly♪」%K%P

0x1FD8
Izumi「And you brought such a large group... Thank you very%Nmuch♪」%K%P

0x1FE4
Izumi「Oh, I'm sorry, where are my manners? I'm 'Izumi Morino', a%Npart-time worker for this shop.」%K%P

0x1FF0
Izumi「This is Kurumi... Oh, but you already know her, right,%NMakoto-kun?」%K%P

0x1FFC
Makoto「... R-Right.」%K%P

0x2008
When Izumi-san smiles, the other three introduce%Nthemselves to Kurumi.%K%P

0x2048
Izumi「Kurumi sometimes helps me with the shop. Come on,%NKurumi, go ahead and properly say 'Hello'.」%K%P

0x2054
Kurumi「Ah... Umm... I'm 'Kurumi Morino'. Right now, since Kurumi's on%Nschool break, she came here to have fun with%NOnee-chan.」%K%P

0x2060
Kurumi「When the shop gets busy, Kurumi helps out with various%Nthings.」%K%P

0x206C
Kurumi「Today, we had a party of tourists come in for lunch...%NWithout Kurumi, we would really have had a lot of trouble%Nwith them...」%K%P

0x2088
Yuka「Kurumi-chan, you're amazing♪」%K%P

0x2094
Yuka pats Kurumi's head and rustles through her hair.%K%P

0x20A8
Kurumi「Yep! After all, Kurumi's all grown up!」%K%P

0x20C4
Okuhiko「Kurumi-chan, what grade are you in right now?」%K%P

0x20D0
Kurumi「Huh? Oh, Kurumi's a third year.」%K%P

0x20DC
Okuhiko「I see, I see, a third year in middle school, huh? You'll be%Ntaking your high school entrance exams soon... that'll be%Ntough.」%K%P

0x20E8
Makoto「Are your eyes messed up, Okuhiko!?」%K%P

0x20FC
Okuhiko「Huh?」%K%P

0x2108
Makoto「Kurumi is in high school! She's a third year in high...」%K%P

0x2114
(Shit...)%K%P

0x2120
Damn me and my big mouth...%K%P

0x212C
Is it because of the irritation I'm feeling from the%Nsensation that's like my heart is being crushed?%K%P

0x2140
Kurumi「Oh... did that fisherman tell you that too?」%K%P

0x214C
Makoto「... Y-Yeah... he did...」%K%P

0x2160
Izumi「Gen-san really does have a loose tongue...」%K%P

0x216C
I break out into cold sweat...%K%P

0x2178
(It'd be best if I just kept my mouth shut for now...)%K%P

0x2184
In order to make sure I don't carelessly say anything%Nunnecessary, I just silently watch over the others as%Nthey talk.%K%P

0x2190
Izumi「... And what about all of you? From the looks of it, you're%Nall college students, right?」%K%P

0x21AC
Yuka「You're right. We should also introduce ourselves...」%K%P

0x21B8
Yuka clears her throat with a small cough before%Npromptly doing so.%K%P

0x21C4
She tells them about our college... about the Seminar...%Nabout the lodge... and just after she tells them Haruka's%Nname...%K%P

0x21E0
Okuhiko「Well then, I am...!」%K%P

0x21EC
... Okuhiko loudly gives his name.%K%P

0x21F8
(It's almost time... for Saki's entrance...)%K%P

0x2204
Okuhiko「The always invigorated youth, the gallant man with a%Ntender heart, the warrior of justice sent by God himself%Nfor the sake of protecting the Earth... his name is%N'Okuhiko Iida'!!!」%K%P

0x2220
Kurumi「... Did you say... Iida?」%K%P

0x222C
Kurumi「Huh? But earlier, you said it was... 'Asakura'.」%K%P

0x2240
Okuhiko「Uh, no, I, uh...」%K%P

0x2278
Saki「My name is 'Asakura'. Is the manager here?」%K%P

0x2284
... ... ...%K%P

0x2290
After that, things play out the exact same way they did%Nlast time.%K%P

0x22AC
Saki snarls and nags at Izumi-san...%K%P

0x22C0
... Yuka realizes that they went to the same middle%Nschool...%K%P

0x22CC
Izumi「Well then, I'll treat you to dinner tonight. It'll be a%Ncelebration for your reunion!」%K%P

0x22D8
... We accept Izumi-san's invitation.%K%P

0x22E4
Izumi「We have paella and Italian salad, as well as pumpkin%Nsoup!」%K%P

0x22F0
(Making paella will be impossible.)%K%P

0x22FC
I mutter these words in my mind as I struggle to keep my%Nmouth shut.%K%P

0x2308
By coming here, I might have finally acquired the secrets%Nof success for getting through this strange world.%K%P

0x2314
Well, because I don't say anything, Izumi-san doesn't%Nrealize that she's out of rice until after she's made the%Nother preparations...%K%P

0x23AC
Like last time, I invite Yuka to go out shopping with me.%K%P

0x23B8
The two of us ride the bike...%K%P

0x2408
Like last time, I invite Haruka to go out shopping with me.%K%P

0x2414
The two of us ride the bike...%K%P

0x2464
Like last time, I invite Saki to go out shopping with me.%K%P

0x2470
The two of us head there...%K%P

0x247C
During that time, Kurumi's words run through my head%Nover and over again.%K%P

0x2488
Kurumi「That's right. Onee-chan and Kurumi are true%Nblood-related sisters.」%K%P

0x24E0
Even after we've finished Izumi-san's home cooked%Ndinner, I still can't calm down.%K%P

0x24F4
Kurumi「Kyahahahaha! Wrong, wrong!」%K%P

0x2500
Kurumi「We've been completely open this whole time! This is%Nnormal for the shop!」%K%P

0x2514
Kurumi「In other words, we're open, but not getting any business.」%K%P

0x2520
Kurumi「That's because almost everyone goes to... Tsukiya.」%K%P

0x252C
Kurumi「You can see it from here. It's that huge building!」%K%P

0x2538
Kurumi「That's Tsukiya Hotel. It's this shop's main competition.」%K%P

0x2544
Kurumi「It may look extravagant, but it's actually an%Neconomically priced hotel.」%K%P

0x2550
Kurumi「On the top floor is a viewpoint restaurant, which is not%Nonly cheaper than here, but the view is simply amazing...」%K%P

0x255C
Kurumi「Besides, they've got a heated pool there as well!」%K%P

0x2570
I can only hear Kurumi's voice.%K%N

0x257C
Kurumi's cheerful laughter pierces my heart.%K%P

0x2588
I won't let her smile disappear...%K%N

0x2594
I won't hurt her ever again...%K%P

0x25A0
As I look at Kurumi, these feelings only grow more and%Nmore.%K%P

0x25F8
Even when we arrive at the pool, my gaze is still fixed on%NKurumi.%K%P

0x260C
Kurumi「Geez, c'mon, try and catch Kurumi!」%K%P

0x2620
Izumi「Hold on Kurumi, don't shout.」%K%P

0x262C
On the opposite side of the pool, the two happy sisters%Nare playing together...%K%P

0x2638
As I think, the gentle evening breeze brushes against%Nmy skin...%K%P

0x2644
It's filled with the scent of spring...%K%P

0x2650
Izumi「Hey! If you don't cut it out, I'll get mad!」%K%P

0x265C
Kurumi「Heh heh, catch Kurumi if you can!」%K%P

0x2668
Kurumi stands close by the pool's edge, egging%NIzumi-san on.%K%P

0x2674
I silently watch the two of them play.%K%P

0x2680
I don't say a word about the earthquake that will hit soon%Nor that Izumi-san will fall in the water...%K%P

0x268C
Izumi「There, I've got you now!」%K%P

0x26F8
The giant sheet of water...%K%P

0x2704
Izumi-san's face emerging out of the water with a%Nfrightened look...%K%P

0x2710
... Soon enough, the ground calms back down...%K%P

0x2740
... The surface of the pool is once again still...%K%P

0x27A8
Izumi-san has climbed out of the pool, and is completely%Nsoaked from head to toe.%K%P

0x27B4
The completely dry Kurumi, and the utterly soaked%NIzumi-san...%K%P

0x27C0
The sisters stare at each other's faces... And suddenly,%Nthey begin to laugh.%K%P

0x27D4
Izumi-san has climbed out of the pool, and is completely%Nsoaked from head to toe.%K%P

0x27E0
The completely dry Kurumi, and the utterly soaked%NIzumi-san...%K%P

0x27F4
The sisters stare at each other's faces...%K%N

0x2808
... And suddenly, they begin to laugh.%K%P

0x2814
They laugh happily.%K%N

0x2820
Those two continue to laugh with no signs of stopping...%K%P

0x282C
No, wait, that's not true. They're about to be interrupted.%K%P

0x2838
Right... in the next instant...%K%P

0x285C
Security guard「HEY!!!」%K%P

0x28E0
And so, we all scurry back to Lunabeach.%K%N

0x28EC
The other six, with the exception of me, are all having%Nfun, having hit it off almost unthinkably well after only%Ntheir first meeting.%K%N

0x28F8
Unable to join in with the others, I just lower my face and%Nstay out of it.%K%N%N

0x2904
But...%K%N

0x2910
I can't stay like this.%K%P

0x2924
If I stay depressed like this, then what will the others%Nthink of me?%K%N

0x2930
To the other girls, this is the first time we've met.%K%N

0x293C
"I don't really know him, but he's a pretty gloomy guy,"...%Nthat might be what they're thinking.%K%N%N

0x2948
Especially Kurumi―Ever since I went flying back in time,%NI've barely spoken to her.%K%P

0x295C
Why was it that Kurumi trusted me the last time?%K%N

0x2968
There's no way I want Kurumi's impression of me to be of%Nsuch a stony-faced guy.%K%N

0x2974
At this rate, history will head in a bad direction!%K%P

0x2988
(Haah... Haah...)%K%N%N

0x2994
Hoping that no one is looking, I take three deep breaths.%K%N%N

0x29A0
(Everything will go well...!)%K%N

0x29AC
(There's nothing to be afraid of...!)%K%N%N

0x29B8
I cheer myself up. and quickly lift my face.%K%P

0x2A54
Saki「... Well, isn't it about time we all went home?」%K%P

0x2A60
Makoto「H-Huh!?」%K%P

0x2A6C
I unintentionally let out a cry of lament.%K%P

0x2A78
Even though I just finally pulled myself together... it's%Nalready this late?%K%P

0x2A84
Saki「After all... Izumi-san, aren't we taking up your time?」%K%P

0x2AA0
Izumi「But this shop will be closed tomorrow. Don't worry about%Nme, it's fine!」%K%P

0x2AAC
Makoto「You see?」%K%P

0x2AC8
Yuka「... Oh! If that's the case, then I've got an idea!」%K%P

0x2AD4
Yuka「Why don't we try going to the pool tomorrow?」%K%P

0x2AE0
Yuka's words make me remember something, which takes%Nme aback.%K%P

0x2AF4
On that beautiful starry night... Kurumi said this...%K%P

0x2B00
Kurumi「The truth is... Kurumi... really wanted to go with everyone...」%K%P

0x2B0C
Kurumi「To the pool... and the hot springs...」%K%P

0x2B18
If we decide to go to the pool here, then won't Kurumi get%Nlonely as a result?%K%P

0x2B24
I glance at Kurumi's face.%K%P

0x2B38
As I thought, Kurumi's face looks a bit uneasy.%K%N

0x2B44
Therefore...%K%P

0x2B50
Makoto「I think it'd be best if we didn't go!」%K%P

0x2B5C
... I say this.%K%P

0x2B70
Yuka「Why?」%K%P

0x2B7C
Makoto「... Won't it be cold?」%K%P

0x2B88
Yuka「Geez, Makoto... didn't you hear what Kurumi-chan said%Nearlier?」%K%P

0x2B94
Yuka「That pool's heated, remember?」%K%P

0x2BA0
Makoto「But...」%K%P

0x2BB4
Kurumi「Kurumi... wants to go to the pool.」%K%P

0x2BC0
―Huh!?%K%P

0x2BCC
Are my ears deceiving me?%K%P

0x2BE8
Haruka「Me too...」%K%P

0x2C04
Saki「I'm in favor as well.」%K%P

0x2C20
Yuka「Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x2C3C
Izumi「Well... If Kurumi says she's going, then yes...」%K%P

0x2C48
Yuka「You see? Everyone except Makoto is in favor of going.」%K%P

0x2C54
Okuhiko「Incidentally, I plan on going diving tomorrow...」%K%P

0x2C60
However, Yuka doesn't even try to look at Okuhiko...%K%P

0x2C6C
Yuka「As I was saying, EVERYONE except Makoto is in favor of%Ngoing.」%K%P

0x2C78
... She repeats this with emphasis.%K%P

0x2C84
Makoto「... I get it...」%K%P

0x2C90
Like Izumi-san, as long as Kurumi says she's going, then I%Nhave no reason to oppose.%K%P

0x2CA4
Yuka「Glad to hear it♪ Then it's decided.」%K%P

0x2CB0
Yuka's in a very good mood.%K%P

0x2CBC
Okuhiko「Incidentally, I plan on going diving tomorrow...」%K%P

0x2CC8
Yuka「Then we'll meet up here tomorrow...」%K%P

0x2CD4
Once again, she ignores Okuhiko's comment.%K%P

0x2CE0
Yuka「As for now, I guess we'll call it a day and go back.」%K%P

0x2CEC
Izumi「Right. Well then, please be careful.」%K%P

0x2D08
Kurumi「Bye-bye♪」%K%P

0x2D14
We say goodbye to Kurumi and Izumi-san, then leave%NLunabeach.%K%P

0x2D20
Honestly, I would have liked to stay with Kurumi a little%Nlonger...%K%P

0x2DA4
We decide to walk down Moon Beach instead of the%Npaved road.%K%P

0x2DB0
As I am the last one to leave the shop, I follow the others%Nfrom behind.%K%P

0x2DBC
At the head are Yuka and Saki, who are talking about%Nstories from their past.%K%P

0x2DC8
Okuhiko, true to his skirt-chaser nature, looks at%NHaruka's face again and again while attempting to strike%Nup a conversation.%K%P

0x2DD4
... Suddenly, I stop walking.%K%P

0x2DE0
Now that I think about it, it was right about now that I%Nfound that "bell" washed up on the beach!%K%P

0x2DEC
I threw the bell back into the ocean... and somehow%NKurumi picked it up on Princess Beach.%K%P

0x2DF8
Why on Princess Beach? ―That's not the current%Nproblem!%K%P

0x2E04
The important part is the fact that "in my dream on the%Nmorning of the 1st in the last loop, that bell was there."%K%P

0x2E10
And yesterday, it was in Kurumi's palm as well...%K%P

0x2E1C
Perhaps if it weren't for that bell, that tragedy might not%Nhave occurred.%K%P

0x2E28
No, that's definitely true.%K%P

0x2E34
Of course, it's not like the bell was the direct cause of%Nthat incident...%K%P

0x2E40
... But if I could annihilate that bell from this world, then I%Nshould be able to sever the infinite loop!%K%P

0x2E4C
If that bell is gone, then the chances of the%Ncircumstances being the same as that dream will%Nbecome 0％.%K%P

0x2E58
In other words, it would be absolutely impossible for the%Nsame event as that dream to occur!%K%P

0x2E64
Why didn't I realize such an important thing until now?%K%P

0x2E70
Because I've been thinking too much today, my head's%Nbeen going in circles!%K%P

0x2E7C
Well, that doesn't matter.%K%P

0x2E88
―Anyway, I've got to hurry and look for the bell!%K%N

0x2E94
... Be that as it may, it still doesn't change the fact that%Nit's been six days.%K%P

0x2EA0
I've forgotten exactly where the bell was.%K%P

0x2EAC
I decide to check only the wet sand, where the waves%Nare washing up...%K%P

0x2EB8
As I begin to look, I totter and meander on the sand as I%Nbegin investigating...%K%P

0x2EC4
... ... ...%K%P

0x2ED0
―It's not here!%K%N

0x2EDC
Why isn't it here!?%K%P

0x2EE8
I retrace my steps one more time, concentrating as hard%Nas I can while looking more carefully at my feet...%K%P

0x2F2C
??「What are you doing?」%K%P

0x2F38
Someone suddenly calls out to me from behind.%K%P

0x2F44
When I turn around in surprise...%K%P

0x2F58
Makoto「K-Kurumi...!」%K%P

0x2F64
Kurumi「You looking for something?」%K%P

0x2F70
Makoto「N-No... just jellyfish.」%K%P

0x2F7C
Kurumi「You were looking for jellyfish in a place like this?」%K%P

0x2F88
Makoto「P-Perhaps one of them washed ashore, you know...?」%K%P

0x2F94
Kurumi「Is there any sort of jellyfish even stupid enough to be%Nthis close?」%K%P

0x2FA0
Makoto「They're very rare... I heard long ago that there were%Nsome here, so I thought I'd look here.」%K%P

0x2FAC
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x2FB8
Makoto「Hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x2FC4
I attempt to fake a laugh.%K%P

0x2FD0
Kurumi「... Do you like jellyfish?」%K%P

0x2FDC
Makoto「You could say I'm quite the jellyfish maniac.」%K%P

0x2FF0
Kurumi「Wow～. Then you're the same as Kurumi.」%K%P

0x2FFC
Makoto「I see... what an unexpected coincidence...」%K%P

0x3008
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x3014
Kurumi smiles... Such a nostalgic smile...%K%P

0x3020
My heart beats faster.%K%P

0x302C
Makoto「... Come to think of it, what were you doing here?」%K%P

0x3040
Kurumi「Well, you see, there's something that Kurumi forgot to tell%NOkuhiko-kun...」%K%P

0x304C
Makoto「Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x3058
Kurumi「That tomorrow, there will be high waves, so he can't go%Ndiving!」%K%P

0x3064
Oh, I see... that was it...%K%P

0x3070
Makoto「Then do you want me to tell him?」%K%P

0x307C
Kurumi「Nope. Kurumi already did that, so it's fine.」%K%P

0x3088
When did she...%K%P

0x3094
Ah, I get it... up until now, I've been looking down this whole%Ntime, so I didn't notice her...%K%P

0x30A0
Kurumi「Well then, Kurumi will be going now.」%K%P

0x30AC
Makoto「Sure... I'll see you tomorrow.」%K%P

0x30B8
Kurumi「Good night～♪」%K%P

0x30DC
Kurumi runs down the beach.%K%P

0x30E8
Yuka「Geez, Makoto! How long do you plan on making us wait!?」%K%P

0x30F4
Yuka's voice reaches me from the end of the beach.%K%P

0x3100
Makoto「Sorry... don't wait up for me!!」%K%P

0x310C
I shout this back.%K%P

0x3118
Yuka draws a check sign on her forehead to show she%Nunderstands.%K%N

0x3124
Everyone goes down the banks one by one, and%Ndisappears.%K%P

0x3130
(There's no way I can go back until I find that bell...)%K%P

0x313C
...%K%N

0x3148
I continue to search for the bell for two more hours...%K%P

0x31DC
In the end, I never found the bell.%K%P

0x31E8
But strangely, I don't feel bad about it.%K%P

0x31F4
On the other hand, I'm feeling quite happy.%K%P

0x3200
If I couldn't find the bell after all of that, then that means%N"the bell is gone."%K%P

0x320C
"The bell is gone,"―in other words, it means that%Nhistory has changed.%K%P

0x3218
That bell probably won't appear in this world ever again.%K%P

0x3224
And if that bell is gone, then that tragedy won't...%K%P

0x3230
I fall asleep feeling at peace...%K%P
