Kurumi「Ready! ... Go!」%K%P

0x160
Before long, the two crabs begin to sumo on a flat rock%Nbeing used as the arena.%K%P

0x16C
Kurumi is serving as the referee, and I am the audience.%K%P

0x178
Kurumi「Go, go!」%K%P

0x184
Kurumi holds her breath in anticipation.%K%P

0x190
Kurumi「GOOOO!」%K%P

0x19C
... The small crab pushes off the larger crab with its small%Nclaws!%K%P

0x1B8
Kurumi「Ring out! Sumo Crab wins♪」%K%P

0x1C4
Kurumi pets both the winning and losing crabs equally.%K%P

0x1D0
After that, she lets the losing crab go while waving%Nsorrowfully at it...%K%N

0x1DC
... It's quite a pleasant scene...%K%P

0x1E8
The "something" that started to sprout within me that%Nday has grown in the blink of an eye, and has now burst%Nopen, having almost completely ripened.%K%P

0x1F4
I want to watch Kurumi as she is right now forever.%K%N

0x200
Because Kurumi's smile is like an angel's...%K%P

0x20C
Yes. This is the second time I've been able to see that%Nangelic smile.%K%P

0x218
So does that mean my wish is to reach heaven?%K%N

0x224
That way, I could fulfill my desire to always watch over%NKurumi for all of eternity...%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「Wow, I'm so hungry.」%K%P

0x288
I say this on purpose.%K%P

0x294
My target is, of course... "that".%K%P

0x2A0
Kurumi「Hee hee hee hee hee...」%K%P

0x2AC
Kurumi「Kurumi thought this would happen...」%K%P

0x2C0
Kurumi「Ta-da～♪ It's a KuruKuru Kurumiracle～♪」%K%P

0x2CC
Kurumi opens the basket she's been holding.%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「Whoa! Caviar!」%K%P

0x2EC
Kurumi「Huh? Caviar?」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Yeah, caviar... I had a feeling you put some in...」%K%P

0x304
Kurumi「Put caviar... in the rice balls?」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「... Huh? Was I wrong?」%K%P

0x31C
Kurumi「Either way, there wasn't any caviar with the rice ball%Nmaking tools, you know?」%K%P

0x328
(Which means... what is this?)%K%P

0x334
I try taking a bite.%K%P

0x340
Munch, munch... munch, munch...%K%N

0x34C
Munch, munch... munch, munch...%K%P

0x358
Huh? What's this texture?%K%N

0x364
Lying on my tongue is some kind of creamy substance...%K%N

0x370
It's has a rich aroma that's spreading all over my mouth...%K%P

0x37C
I've never tasted it before, but it's so good that I feel%Nlike I've died and gone to heaven!%K%P

0x388
Makoto「Kurumi... what's... in these?」%K%P

0x39C
Kurumi「Foie gras.」%K%P

0x3A8
Makoto「Ah... foie gras... So that's why it's so good...」%K%P

0x3B4
Makoto「FOIE GRAS!? You mean one of the three greatest%Ndelicacies in the world!?」%K%P

0x3C0
Kurumi「That's right.」%K%P

0x3CC
Makoto「Is it the real deal?」%K%P

0x3E0
Kurumi「Of course♪ It was in the fridge at the shop, so Kurumi%Nborrowed some♪」%K%P

0x3EC
Makoto「Izumi-san... doesn't know, does she...?」%K%P

0x3F8
Kurumi「It's all right, it's all right. Onee-chan isn't the kind of%Nperson who will notice it...」%K%P

0x404
(Well, you're in for quite the surprise later...)%K%P

0x410
Kurumi「Ah... Hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x41C
Kurumi「When we're done eating, you wanna do something fun?」%K%P

0x428
Makoto「Sure!」%K%P

0x4B8
When we walk down the road surrounded by cherry%Nblossom trees, Kurumi suddenly asks me something.%K%P

0x4C4
Kurumi「Hey? Do you want Kurumi to show you something%Ninteresting?」%K%P

0x4D0
Huh?%K%N

0x4DC
This is strange...%K%N

0x4E8
Wasn't she supposed to talk about her "dream" here...?%K%P

0x4F4
Kurumi「Well? Do you want Kurumi to show you?」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x50C
Kurumi「Then you can... if you beat Kurumi in%NRock-Paper-Scissors♪」%K%P

0x518
Rock-Paper-Scissors???%K%P

0x524
Kurumi「Let's go～♪ Rock, Paper, Scissors...」%K%P

0x530
Makoto「Go!」%K%P

0x53C
In that instant, I remember that I lost by using "paper"%Nlast time, so I instantly go with "rock".%K%P

0x550
Kurumi「Yay～, Kurumi won～♪」%K%P

0x55C
She's right... Kurumi has "paper".%K%P

0x568
Kurumi「Like Kurumi said, you don't get to see it, Onii-chan～」%K%P

0x574
...%K%N

0x580
Nah, it can't be...%K%N

0x58C
...%K%P

0x598
Nevertheless, it seems that history has subtly changed,%Nwhat with the lack of caviar and Kurumi not telling me%Nabout her dream...%K%P

0x5A4
I wonder why?%K%N

0x5B0
Or rather, I wonder if it's stranger that those are the only%Nthings that have changed today so far.%K%P

0x5BC
Up until now, things have been completely different than%Nthey were the first time.%K%P

0x5C8
For example, Kurumi still hasn't gone to the shrine once%Nthis time.%K%N

0x5D4
She also never told me about her scar.%K%P

0x5E0
This is also the first time we've been to Viewpoint Park...%K%N

0x5EC
... Well, whatever...%K%N

0x5F8
If everything was just exactly the same, it'd be boring.%K%P

0x604
It's precisely because unexpected things occur that%Neveryday life is made interesting.%K%P

0x610
Kurumi「C'mon, let's hurry up and do that 'something fun'♪」%K%P

0x61C
Kurumi grabs my hand, and then steadily guides me%Ntowards Viewpoint Park...%K%P

0x628
Just like the last 5th, my heart is as clear as a blue sky%Non a sunny day...%K%P

0x6C4
Kurumi and I arrive at Viewpoint Park, and sit down on the%Ntiles with a thump.%K%P

0x6D0
When we do, Kurumi reaches into the bottom of the empty%Nbasket, and slowly takes something out.%K%P

0x6DC
Kurumi「Ta-da♪ It's KuruKuru Kurumi Magic♪」%K%P

0x6E8
Makoto「That's origami, isn't it?」%K%P

0x6F4
Kurumi「Bingo～♪」%K%P

0x700
Kurumi「By the way, Onii-chan, can you fold origami?」%K%P

0x70C
Makoto「Yeah! Leave it to me! I'm a master at folding origami%Nturtles!」%K%P

0x720
Kurumi「Wha～at! No way～!」%K%P

0x72C
She stares at me with doubt...%K%P

0x738
Kurumi「Even veterans fail with turtles sometimes, you know?」%K%P

0x744
Makoto「I know. They say it takes about three years to perfect a%Npeach and chestnut tree, and about eight years to%Nperfect a turtle, right?」%K%P

0x750
Kurumi「Ah... how did you know something only origami maniacs%Nknow?」%K%P

0x75C
Makoto「I heard it once in the past from this girl who was an%Norigami maniac.」%K%P

0x768
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x774
Kurumi「But just knowing isn't enough to fold origami. It's a world%Nwhere experience and good sense mean everything...」%K%P

0x780
Those eyes of hers are dubious again...%K%P

0x78C
Makoto「I really can fold it! I remember perfectly how to!」%K%P

0x798
(Kurumi... you were the one who taught me, after all!)%K%P

0x7A4
Kurumi「Okay. Then try folding one.」%K%P

0x7B0
Kurumi hands me a sheet of origami paper.%K%P

0x7BC
Makoto「All right. Watch carefully!」%K%P

0x7D0
Kurumi「Yeah. Well then, let's see what you've got...」%K%P

0x7DC
I begin to fold a turtle using the technique that Kurumi%Nhad taught me.%K%P

0x7E8
Fold, fold... fold, fold... Fold, fold... fold, fold...%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「And this is the part where I turn it inside out, then only%Nfold the left side like a valley...」%K%P

0x800
Kurumi「Ah... impressive. Even though that's the most difficult%Npart...」%K%P

0x80C
Her praise makes me a little proud.%K%P

0x818
Humm, humm～♪ Humm, humm～♪ Humm, humm, humm～♪%K%P

0x824
Fold, fold... fold, fold... Fold, fold... bend, bend...%K%N

0x830
―Rip.%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「Ah...」%K%P

0x850
Kurumi「Aah～! Why is it completely torn off!」%K%P

0x85C
Kurumi「You can't do it after all～!」%K%P

0x868
Makoto「No... This is...」%K%P

0x874
Kurumi「You're helpless. Kurumi will teach you～♪」%K%P

0x880
Makoto「... Sure...」%K%P
