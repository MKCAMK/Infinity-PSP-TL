An hour passes until Yuka stops weeping her eyes out.%NHer tears have finally dried and her eyes are no longer%Nred.%K%P

0x34
She's completely regained her composure now.%K%P

0x40
Those many tears were clearly the result of Yuka rinsing%Nout her heart.%K%P

0x4C
Makoto「Yuka... I have to confirm something with you...」%K%P

0x58
Makoto「Do you also remember everything from before?」%K%P

0x64
Makoto「Do you remember what happened to us?」%K%P

0x78
Yuka gives a nod.%K%P

0x84
Makoto「Then you didn't forget anything else before that, right?%NWhat happened in the past six days, that is...?」%K%P

0x90
Yuka「No, I remember it all...」%K%P

0x9C
Yuka「The taste of Izumi-san's paella...」%K%P

0xA8
Yuka「Saki almost drowning at the pier...」%K%P

0xB4
Yuka「The shock I felt from learning Haruka was a clone...」%K%P

0xC0
Yuka「Kurumi-chan's disappearance, and then finding her at%Nthe shrine...」%K%P

0xCC
Yuka「Now that I think about it, that might have been when all of%Nthis began...」%K%P

0xD8
Yuka「If we hadn't gone to the shrine back then...」%K%P

0xEC
(If we hadn't gone to the shrine...)%K%P

0xF8
That... might be true.%K%P

0x104
That's why back then, when I tried to go to the shrine,%NYuka desperately tried to stop me...%K%P

0x118
Yuka「I also remember that night too...」%K%P

0x124
Yuka「When you and I... looked at the starry sky... that night...」%K%P

0x130
My heart beats very loudly at those words.%K%P

0x13C
That was the night I made that vow...%K%P

0x148
To... protect Y―%K%P

0x15C
Yuka「It looks like we've gone back to the starting point.」%K%P

0x168
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x174
Yuka「But I wonder... is that really true?」%K%P

0x180
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x18C
Yuka「Well, perhaps your watch might be malfunctioning.」%K%P

0x198
Yuka「We can't be certain from the watch alone.」%K%P

0x1A4
Yuka「We've got to confirm it from other sources.」%K%P

0x1B0
Makoto「... Confirm what?」%K%P

0x1C4
Yuka walks briskly to the door, and starts to grab the%Ndoorknob.%K%P

0x1D0
Yuka「If we really time traveled...」%K%P

0x1DC
Makoto「... H-Hold on!」%K%P

0x1F0
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x1FC
Yuka turns around.%K%P

0x208
Makoto「Don't tell me that you're planning to tell Haruka and%NOkuhiko everything?」%K%P

0x214
Yuka「No way...」%K%P

0x220
Yuka「I think it'd be best if we still kept this quiet.」%K%P

0x22C
Yuka「So pretend that nothing's happened and act like your%Nusual self...」%K%P

0x238
Pretend that nothing's happened... Can I really do that...?%K%P

0x244
Yuka「Anyway, our first priority right now is to confirm the date...」%K%P

0x250
Yuka「... Even if we talk afterwards, it won't be too late, right?」%K%P

0x280
With that, Yuka ventures out into the living room.%K%P

0x28C
I immediately follow after her.%K%P

0x304
Yuka「Good morning!」%K%P

0x310
I am surprised by her tone.%K%P

0x31C
In a matter of seconds, she's gone from an extremely%Nserious tone to an almost unimaginably cheerful voice.%K%P

0x328
"Pretend that nothing happened."―Yuka is really%Ntrying her best to do so.%K%P

0x344
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x350
Okuhiko's greeting still sounds like a dictator looking%Ndown on his people.%K%P

0x35C
Okuhiko「You woke up really late, huh?」%K%P

0x370
Okuhiko「Is it my imagination, or did the two of you just come out of%Nthe same room?」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x390
Okuhiko「It can't be that you were...」%K%P

0x3A4
Okuhiko「... Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x3B8
While laughing, he glares at me.%K%P

0x3C4
(Dammit, Okuhiko's the same as always...)%K%P

0x3D8
Okuhiko is sitting down next to Haruka on the sofa.%K%P

0x3E4
There's about 50 cm between him and Haruka.%K%P

0x3F0
It's the exact same scene from the 1st...%K%P

0x3FC
This feels kind of strange.%K%P

0x408
It feels like changing the TV channel during commercial%Nbreak, only to find the same commercial playing on that%Nother channel.%K%P

0x414
It's a little creepy...%K%P

0x420
Yuka「Hey, Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0x42C
Yuka speaks up.%K%P

0x438
Yuka「What's today's date again?」%K%P

0x44C
Okuhiko「Huh!? Hey, what's wrong, Yuka-chan? Did you hit your%Nhead?」%K%P

0x458
Yuka「H-Hmm... Lately, I've been awfully forgetful...」%K%P

0x46C
Okuhiko「Forgetful, huh... I didn't think you were that ditzy...」%K%P

0x478
Okuhiko smiles as if he's saying, "Oh brother."%K%P

0x484
Okuhiko「Oh well...」%K%P

0x490
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara? Do this young lady a favor and tell her.」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「H-Huh!? ... T-Tell her what!?」%K%P

0x4B0
Okuhiko「Today's date, obviously!」%K%P

0x4BC
Th-This is bad...%K%P

0x4C8
How should I answer???%K

0x1D28
It's Monday, April 1st.

0x1D34
It's Sunday, April 7th.

0x1D40
I forgot.

0x1D4C
Ask Haruka.

0x528
Makoto「It's Monday, April 1st. Isn't that obvious?」%K%P

0x534
I try to play dumb.%K%P

0x540
It's a trifling bet, but I'm confident in it.%K%P

0x54C
Okuhiko「Right. And that's how it is.」%K%P

0x568
Yuka「Y-Yeah... Of course. Right, right, right, right...」%K%P

0x574
Yuka「What was I saying... I wonder if I'm still half asleep.」%K%P

0x580
Okuhiko「Forgetting the date on the first day of the Camp... are%Nyou really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0x594
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x5A0
Yuka fakes a laugh.%K%P

0x5AC
Okuhiko「I can just tell it's going to be hard going... Hang in there,%Nleader.」%K%P

0x5C8
Makoto「Perhaps it's Sunday, April 7th...?」%K%P

0x5D4
I say this timidly.%K%P

0x5E0
Right as I say that, Yuka stomps on my tiptoes!%K%P

0x5EC
―Damn, this really hurts! ... But I've got to endure it!%K%P

0x600
Okuhiko「Huh!?」%K%P

0x61C
Okuhiko「Ishihara... that's lame...」%K%P

0x628
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x634
Okuhiko「Was that supposed to be your idea of a joke?」%K%P

0x640
Then, that means it's really...%K%P

0x65C
Yuka「A-Ah... I remember now!」%K%P

0x668
Yuka「Today's Monday, April 1st, right?」%K%P

0x674
Yuka immediately follows up.%K%P

0x688
Okuhiko「Ha ha, isn't that obvious?」%K%P

0x694
Okuhiko「Forgetting the date on the first day of the Camp... are%Nyou really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0x6A8
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x6B4
Yuka fakes a laugh.%K%P

0x6C0
Okuhiko「I can just tell it's going to be hard going... Hang in there,%Nleader.」%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「I forgot.」%K%P

0x6E0
I give a short answer.%K%P

0x6EC
I have no choice but to turn upon Okuhiko.%K%P

0x6F8
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x704
But Okuhiko doesn't answer.%K%P

0x710
(Hmm???)%K%P

0x71C
Just then...%K%P

0x730
Okuhiko「Ah ha... I see.」%K%P

0x73C
Okuhiko「So the two of you are trying to make fun of me?」%K%P

0x748
Yuka「N-No, it's not like that, really!」%K%P

0x754
Okuhiko「Are you going to say you really forgot?」%K%P

0x760
Okuhiko「No matter what, that's impossible.」%K%P

0x76C
Okuhiko「Today's the first day of the Camp, so there's no way%Nanyone could have forgotten the date.」%K%P

0x778
Then, that means it's really...%K%P

0x794
Yuka「A-Ah... I remember now!」%K%P

0x7A0
Yuka「Today's Monday, April 1st, right?」%K%P

0x7B4
Okuhiko「Isn't that obvious!?」%K%P

0x7C0
Okuhiko「Too bad, but it'll take more than that to trick me!」%K%P

0x7D4
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka fakes a laugh...%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「R-Right... today's date? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...」%K%P

0x800
Makoto「You okay, Yuka? You must be seriously ill to forget%Nsomething like that, huh?」%K%P

0x80C
Makoto「Right, Haruka?」%K%P

0x818
I indirectly bring the subject up to Haruka.%K%P

0x834
Haruka「She's probably... still half asleep.」%K%P

0x840
Makoto「Yes, I see, you might be right.」%K%P

0x84C
Haruka「Today is... Monday, April 1st.」%K%P

0x858
Yuka「A-Ah... r-r-r-r-r-r-right, of course!」%K%P

0x864
Yuka「What am I saying...」%K%P

0x870
Okuhiko「Forgetting the date on the first day of the Camp... are%Nyou really all right, Yuka-chan...?」%K%P

0x87C
Yuka「Haha, haha, hahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x888
Yuka fakes a laugh.%K%P

0x894
Okuhiko「I can just tell it's going to be hard going... Hang in there,%Nleader.」%K%P

0x8A8
Our guess was right after all.%K%P

0x8B4
Today is Monday, April 1st ―My watch was correct.%K%P

0x8C8
Yuka「Ah!」%K%P

0x8D4
Yuka suddenly shouts.%K%P

0x8E8
Yuka「Come on, Makoto!」%K%P

0x8F4
She points at the terrace.%K%P

0x900
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x924
Without giving me time to think, she suddenly grabs my%Nhand, and starts walking out to the terrace...%K%P

0x994
Makoto「Wh-What is it, Yuka? Is there something here?」%K%P

0x9A8
Yuka「Of course not! Why would there be?」%K%P

0x9B4
Makoto「Then why...?」%K%P

0x9C0
Yuka「Because I don't want them to overhear us.」%K%P

0x9CC
Makoto「Ah... so that was it?」%K%P

0x9D8
Yuka「Geez, you're so thickheaded...」%K%P

0x9E4
Makoto「... So what should we do? We've confirmed that today is%Nthe 1st, but...」%K%P

0x9F8
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0xA04
Makoto「Wouldn't it be best to tell them everything after all?」%K%P

0xA18
Yuka「We can't!」%K%P

0xA24
Makoto「Why not?」%K%P

0xA38
Yuka「There's no time right now. I'll tell you later.」%K%P

0xA44
Yuka「If we spend too much time here, they may get suspicious%Nof us...」%K%P

0xA60
Yuka「For now, just act normally.」%K%P

0xA6C
Yuka「Never say anything like what you said earlier again, all%Nright!?」%K%P

0xA80
Yuka「For now, can you act like you usually do, like you did just%Nnow?」%K%P

0xA8C
Makoto「But―」%K%P

0xAA0
Yuka「It's fine! Just do as I say!」%K%P

0xAAC
Yuka「Anyway, act normal... Okay? Do you understand?」%K%P

0xADC
Yuka has gone back inside without listening to my%Nanswer.%K%P

0xAE8
(Mmm...)%K%P

0xAF4
(Well, for the time being, I'll just do what Yuka says...)%K%P

0xB7C
Okuhiko「Was there something on the terrace?」%K%P

0xB88
Yuka「Yeah, a bush warbler. It was perched on the railing...」%K%P

0xB94
Yuka tells a quick lie.%K%P

0xBA8
Okuhiko「Oh, a bush warbler... Really makes you feel that it's the%Nstart of spring, huh...?」%K%P

0xBC4
Yuka「Ah, that's right!」%K%P

0xBD0
Yuka「Guys, you haven't had breakfast yet, right?」%K%P

0xBDC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBE8
Okuhiko「Yeah. Now that you mention it, my stomach's been%Ngrowling for a while.」%K%P

0xC0C
Yuka「Well then, I'll start making something now.」%K%P

0xC18
Makoto「WHAT!?」%K%P

0xC48
Yuka「What, is there something wrong?」%K%P

0xC54
Makoto「You're damn right there is! I can't let you do that!」%K%P

0xC68
Yuka「Wh-Why!?」%K%P

0xC74
Makoto「I don't need to tell you!」%K%P

0xC88
Yuka「What's your reason!?」%K%P

0xC94
Makoto「The reason doesn't matter!」%K%P

0xCA0
Makoto「In the first place, what do you plan on making!?」%K%P

0xCB4
Yuka「Well, in the fridge, there's eggs, tomatoes, corn beef...」%K%P

0xCC0
Yuka「... Fermented soybeans, enoki mushrooms, mayonnaise...」%K%P

0xCCC
Yuka「... Chocolate, ice cream, and muscat jelly, so...」%K%P

0xCE0
Yuka「... I'll put it all in a mixer and cook it in a frying pan. What do%Nyou think...?」%K%P

0xCEC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xCF8
Okuhiko「S-Sorry, but... I'll pass...」%K%P

0xD04
Haruka「M-Me too...」%K%P

0xD10
Makoto「See what I mean?」%K%P

0xD24
Yuka「Why!? It'll definitely taste good!」%K%P

0xD30
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD3C
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0xD48
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xD74
Yuka「Fine! Then I'll add some toast to it!」%K%P

0xEC0
Somehow, the three of us managed to convince her to%Ngive up.%K%P

0xECC
... After that, we washed our faces, brushed our teeth,%Nand changed our clothes.%K%P

0xED8
Okuhiko turns on the TV in the corner of the room.%K%P

0xEE4
The image I'm seeing from the cathode ray tubes is a%Nfamiliar one... it's the image of a small stream flowing.%K%P

0xEF0
Okuhiko quickly changes the channel.%K%P

0xEFC
This time, an image of a cooking show appears.%K%P

0xF08
In the upper right hand corner of the screen is the title%Nlogo, "A Healthy YOUtopia".%K%P

0xF14
Okuhiko changes the channel again, but all we see is the%Nriver from earlier.%K%P

0xF28
Okuhiko「It seems like all they've got is this local broadcasting%Ncrap...」%K%P

0xF3C
Okuhiko changes the channel back to "A Healthy%NYOUtopia".%K%P

0xF50
Haruka「What should we do... about food?」%K%P

0xF5C
The cooking on screen only doubles Haruka's hunger.%K%P

0xF78
Okuhiko「We finally got dressed and everything, so how about%Ngoing out to eat?」%K%P

0xF84
Makoto「No, if we eat now, then we'll just get hungry again too%Nearly in the afternoon, right?」%K%P

0xF90
Makoto「If we're going to go out, then wouldn't it be best to wait a%Nlittle bit? Like, say... another half hour...」%K%P

0xF9C
Of course, I have a plan.%K%P

0xFA8
Okuhiko「Well, you've got a point...」%K%P

0xFB4
Okuhiko says this.%K%P

0xFC0
Haruka also gives a nod of agreement.%K%P

0xFD4
This plan seems to bewilder Yuka and causes her to tilt%Nher head in confusion.%K%P

0xFE0
I mouth the words 'That'!" However, as it's only one%Nsyllable, Yuka doesn't get it. Therefore, I mouth the%Nletters "T-H-A-T".%K%P

0xFEC
But Yuka still doesn't seem to understand what I mean.%K%P

0xFF8
She probably doesn't remember...%K%P

0x1004
That's right... in half an hour, "that" will arrive...%K%P

0x1074
The doorbell rings.%K%P

0x1080
Just on time.%K%P

0x108C
The four of us look towards the front door all at once.%K%P

0x10B4
Makoto「Ah, I'll get it.」%K%P

0x10C0
I stand straight up, and walk to the door.%K%P

0x1164
Kurumi「Thank you for your continued patronage♪」%K%P

0x1170
Kurumi「Here's the seafood pizza you ordered!」%K%P

0x117C
Makoto「Oh, thank you!」%K%P

0x1188
Okuhiko「Huh? Ishihara, when did you order that?」%K%P

0x1194
Makoto「Huh? O-Oh... earlier.」%K%P

0x11A0
Okuhiko「Earlier?」%K%P

0x11AC
Okuhiko「... Oh, so that's why you said 'it'd be best if we waited half%Nan hour'...」%K%P

0x11B8
Okuhiko「Then you should have just said so from the beginning...」%K%P

0x11C4
Kurumi「Huh? Did something happen?」%K%P

0x11D0
Makoto「No, it's nothing. Just talking amongst ourselves...」%K%P

0x11DC
Yuka「Hold on, Makoto! It's not nothing, is it!?」%K%P

0x11E8
Makoto「... Huh???」%K%P

0x1228
Yuka「Isn't the pizza a mistake?」%K%P

0x1234
(Ahh! Don't say that!)%K%P

0x1250
Kurumi「Huh!? A mistake!?」%K%P

0x125C
A disturbed expression clouds her face as she%Nsearches through her pocket with her free hand until%Nshe pulls out a scrap of paper.%K%P

0x1270
Kurumi「But the receipt definitely says you ordered a "Seafood%NPizza", didn't you?」%K%P

0x127C
Yuka「I'm telling you, that's not what I meant. I'm saying we didn't%Norder anything.」%K%P

0x1288
Kurumi「But...」%K%P

0x1294
She checks the receipt again...%K%P

0x12A0
Kurumi「... This is definitely the right address.」%K%P

0x12AC
Yuka「Well then, what's the name on the receiver's address?」%K%P

0x12B8
Kurumi「A-S-A-K-U-R-A... it says Asakura here.」%K%P

0x12CC
Yuka「See? Unfortunately, there isn't anyone here named―」%K%P

0x12D8
Haruka「Wait...」%K%P

0x12F4
Haruka「Wait a... minute.」%K%P

0x1300
Suddenly, Haruka cuts in.%K%P

0x1314
Haruka「I-I...」%K%P

0x1320
Haruka「I'm Asakura...」%K%P

0x132C
Yuka「!?」%K%P

0x1338
Okuhiko「!?」%K%P

0x1344
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x1358
Kurumi「Whew... that's a relief♪」%K%P

0x1364
Kurumi「That was a little alarming when you said it was a 'mistake'.」%K%P

0x1378
Kurumi「All right! Well then...」%K%P

0x1384
Kurumi takes a thin box out of the silver bag.%K%P

0x1390
Kurumi「It'll be 1200 yen!」%K%P

0x13A4
Haruka takes some money out of her pocket, and gives%Nit to Kurumi.%K%P

0x13B8
Kurumi「Thank you very much♪」%K%P

0x13CC
Kurumi gives a deep bow before she energetically runs%Noff...%K%P

0x1448
The four of us eat the pizza.%K%P

0x1454
Yuka eats the pizza in content, even though she had%Ntried to sabotage my plan to take the pizza and almost%Nscrewed everything up.%K%P

0x1460
I suddenly wonder how hungry the waiting Saki is right%Nnow.%K%P

0x146C
I feel kind of guilty.%K%P

0x1478
But I did what I had to do.%K%P

0x1484
I convince myself what I did was a necessary evil... our%Nstomachs just couldn't fight off the hunger...%K%P

0x14F0
Announcer「Today is Monday, April 1st. This is the afternoon news.」%K%P

0x14FC
We hear a polite voice from the announcer on the TV,%Nwhich is still on.%K%P

0x1508
At the same time, that awful bird chirping noise starts...%K%P

0x1520
Suddenly, I remember when I saw the cherry blossoms.%K%P

0x152C
Yuka said... that her first love was similar to me.%K%P

0x1538
"If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid."%K%P

0x1544
I don't think I could be similar to a guy who'd use a cheap%Nline like that.%K%P

0x1550
It feels more like something Okuhiko would say rather%Nthan me.%K%P

0x155C
I think this as I casually look towards Yuka.%K%P

0x1568
She looks distracted, as if she's trying to avoid eye%Ncontact with someone or something.%K%P

0x158C
Okuhiko「Hey, shouldn't we go now?」%K%P

0x1598
As he rises, Okuhiko flicks his long bangs away from his%Nface.%K%P

0x15B4
Yuka「'Go'... where?」%K%P

0x15C8
Okuhiko「Huh? What are you saying, Yuka-chan? We talked about%Nit last night, right...?」%K%P

0x15D4
Okuhiko「To play tennis. T-E-N-N-I-S!」%K%P

0x15E8
Yuka「A-Ah... that?」%K%P

0x15F4
Yuka「Right, right... then shall we go play tennis...?」%K%P

0x1600
Makoto「But... Haruka, you don't want to play, do you?」%K%P

0x1614
In the instant I say that, Yuka glares at me.%K%P

0x1630
Haruka「Huh...? Y-Yes, that's right.」%K%P

0x1644
Haruka「Instead of tennis... I want to see the ocean.」%K%P

0x1660
Okuhiko「The ocean!? ... I see, the ocean, huh...」%K%P

0x166C
After thinking for a little while, he suggests this...%K%P

0x1680
Okuhiko「Then I'll go to the ocean, too.」%K%P

0x168C
Okuhiko「We're finally by the ocean, so it's only natural that we%Nought to see it first!」%K%P

0x16A0
Yuka「Hmmmmmmm... Yeah! I've got it!」%K%P

0x16AC
