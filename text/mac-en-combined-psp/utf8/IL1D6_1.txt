I'm sitting on a dining chair, staring at Izumi-san from%Nbehind.%K%P

0x154
Izumi-san is silently looking out the window right now,%Nsoftly touching the glass with her palm.%K%P

0x168
Izumi「Oh? It's raining...」%K%P

0x174
Makoto「What...? Rain?」%K%P

0x180
I walk up next to Izumi-san while saying this.%K%P

0x194
I look outside the window.%K%P

0x1A0
Just as Izumi-san said, raindrops have started to fall.%K%P

0x1AC
The two of keep silent as we watch the drizzling rain%Ncontinue to fall.%K%P

0x1B8
The awkward atmosphere from this evening has%Nreturned, wrapping both of us up in it.%K%P

0x1C4
I can't stand this silence...%K%N

0x1D0
... I decide to tell her about my premonition for tomorrow.%K%P

Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x29C
Makoto「Please... trust me...」%K%P

0x2C0
The silence returns...%K%P

0x2E8
Before we know it, the rain picks up.%K%P

0x2F4
The sound of the rain striking the earth echoes in this%Ndark room.%K%P

0x300
Mixed in with the sound of the rain is the faint sound of%NIzumi-san's cold sighs.%K%P

0x30C
Before long...%K%P

0x354
Izumi「I understand... but...」%K%P

0x360
Izumi「I can't just not 'take a single step outside', right? I have%Nto go back to the shop...」%K%P

0x36C
... Izumi-san answers.%K%P

0x378
Makoto「But!」%K%P

0x39C
Izumi「It's all right. Besides... if you're that worried, then you can%Nbe my bodyguard.」%K%P

0x3A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3B4
Izumi「Will you help out at the shop tomorrow as well?」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「Y-Yes... But...」%K%P

0x3CC
Makoto「But Izumi-san... do you believe me?」%K%P

0x3D8
Izumi-san slowly nods.%K%P

0x3E4
Makoto「Then I'll trust you too...」%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「No matter what happens... I'll trust you!」%K%P

0x404
Izumi-san looks a little surprised,%K%P

0x418
but she soon returns with a calm smile.%K%P

0x464
...%K%P

0x470
Afterwards, Izumi-san and I briefly watch the rain fall from%Nby the window in silence.%K%P

0x47C
Then, a little over an hour later, Izumi-san heads up to%Nthe loft...%K%P

0x500
Early in the morning, Izumi-san and I return to Lunabeach%Ntogether.%K%P

0x50C
I help set up the shop before it opens... and before long,%Nopening time arrives.%K%P

0x518
But today's so slow that it makes it seem like the rush of%Ncustomers yesterday never happened.%K%P

0x524
An hour has passed since the shop opened, but there%Nstill hasn't been a single customer.%K%P

0x530
Is it the weather's fault?%K%P

0x53C
Last night's rain hasn't lifted at all.%K%P

0x5CC
After a while, the rest of the group arrives at the shop.%K%P

0x5D8
They rest their hands on their chins as time blankly%Npasses by.%K%P

0x5E4
...%K%P

0x5F0
Yuka「... I'm bored.」%K%P

0x5FC

0x624
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x640

0x76C
Izumi「KURUMIIII!!!」%K%P

0x780
...%K%P

0x78C
Time slowly and quietly passes by...%K%P

0x810
Izumi「Haah〜... might as well close up for today.」%K%P

0x81C
No customers have come, so it seems like Izumi-san has%Ngiven up on today's work.%K%P

0x828
Izumi「This is actually good timing for me to go shopping.」%K%P

0x85C
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0x880
Izumi「It's raining outside... I wonder if it's all right to use the car%Nafter so long...?」%K%P

0x88C
Makoto「Y-You can't, Izumi-san!!」%K%P

0x898
I frantically try to stop her.%K%P

0x8A4
If she goes outside now, I don't know what will happen.%K%P

0x8B0
No matter what, I have to keep Izumi-san inside the shop%Ntoday, or else...%K%P

0x8BC
Then, as I think that...%K%P

0x8E8
Yuka「Hee hee...」%K%P

0x8F4
Makoto「Wh-What is it, Yuka ...?」%K%P

0x908
Okuhiko「Heh, heh heh heh...」%K%P

0x914
Makoto「Y-You too, Okuhiko...?」%K%P

0x930
Kurumi「Pfft! Kyahahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x93C
Makoto「K-Kurumi...!?」%K%P

0x950
Okuhiko「Ahahahahahahahaha...」%K%P

0x980
With Kurumi's laugh being the trigger, everyone starts%Nbreaking out into roars of laughter for some reason.%K%P

0x994
Okuhiko「Sorry. The truth is, everyone's been tricking you,%NIshihara. We thought we'd try playing a little prank on you.」%K%P

0x9A0
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x9AC
Okuhiko「To make you say foolish things like, 'I'm able to have%Npremonitions' and all of that...」%K%P

0x9B8
Okuhiko「We all conspired together, and pretended your%Npremonitions were really correct.」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x9D0
Okuhiko「For example, there was that time where you said 'The%Ncar's battery is dead, so we can't use it'...」%K%P

0x9DC
Okuhiko「Izumi-san purposely pulled the key back right when she%Nturned it in the ignition so that it would sound like the car%Nwasn't working, pretending the battery really was dead.」%K%P

0xA20
Okuhiko「And remember when you asked 'Aren't we having curry%Ntonight?'...」%K%P

0xA34
Okuhiko「And remember when you asked 'Aren't we having stew%Ntonight?'...」%K%P

0xA48
Okuhiko「And remember when you asked 'Aren't we having meat%Npotatoes tonight?'...」%K%P

0xA54
Okuhiko「I quickly ran out to buy the ingredients, and Izumi-san%Nswiftly made the food.」%K%P

0xA60
Okuhiko「Long story short, the futures that you predicted were%Nmerely forced to become so by us cooperating to%Nmanipulate you.」%K%P

0xA6C
Okuhiko「So it's only natural that there's no way that event where%NIzumi-san dies will happen.」%K%P

0xA88
Izumi「... Sorry, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xAA4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAB8
Izumi「... Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0xAC4
Makoto「... 'Sorry'? ... SORRY!?」%K%P

0xAD8
Izumi「—!!」%K%P

0xB00
Makoto「So you're saying that everyone has been deceiving%Nme!?」%K%P

0xB0C
Makoto「You're telling me that everything that happened in the%Nlast six days was all planned!!?」%K%P

0xB20
Something within me snaps.%K%P

0xB2C
Angry words rapidly pour out of my mouth...%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「When you treated us to dinner, the commotion when Saki%Nfell into the ocean, when you revealed Haruka was a%Nclone...」%K%P

0xB44
Makoto「When I predicted what dinner would be...」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「... You all... you all lied to me...」%K%P

0xB5C
Makoto「At the Test of Courage, when you told me not to worry,%Nthat's what you meant...」%K%P

0xB68
They're overflowing... My words laced with anger are%Nflooding out like waves during a typhoon...%K%P

0xB8C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xB98
Makoto「And also... what you told me that day at Viewpoint Park%Nas well...」%K%P

0xBAC
Izumi「!!!」%K%P

0xBB8
Makoto「From the beginning to the end, everything was a lie,%Nwasn't it!?」%K%P

0xBD4
Okuhiko「Ishihara... what happened at Viewpoint-」%K%P

0xBE0
Makoto「Shut up! Shut the fuck up, Okuhiko!!」%K%P

0xBF4
Okuhiko「...!」%K%P

0xC24
Makoto「Well, how about it...? Answer me...」%K%P

0xC38
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xC44
Izumi「... Umm... Makoto-kun... Before I answer, there's just one%Nthing I want to tell you...」%K%P

0xC50
Makoto「I don't want to hear your damn excuses!」%K%P

0xC5C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xC68
Makoto「That's... enough... I've had enough of going along with this%Ncheap drama...」%K%P

0xC7C
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you're wrong... Please, listen to me...」%K%P

0xC88
Makoto「So that you can lie to me some more? So that you can%Ntrick me and make me dance to your tune even more?」%K%P

0xC9C
Izumi「... You don't... trust me?」%K%P

0xCA8
Makoto「How the hell can I trust you when everything you say is%Ncoated with lies!?」%K%P

0xCBC
Izumi「... You're wrong... you're wrong...」%K%P

0xCC8
Makoto「You're still lying this late into the game!?」%K%P

0xCD4
Makoto「I was nothing more than a plaything for your own%Namusement, wasn't I?」%K%P

0xCE0
Makoto「I bet you had a riot, laughing behind the back of a man%Nyounger than you about his constant anxiety. Isn't that%Nright!?」%K%P

0xD6C
A sharp pain run across my cheek.%K%P

0xD78
Izumi-san's trembling hand is raised overhead.%K%P

0xD84
Her eyes are absolutely overflowing with tears...%K%P

0xD90
Izumi「Goodbye...」%K%P

0xD9C
Izumi-san finally says this.%K%P

0xE08
Izumi-san violently throws open the door, and rushes%Nout into the downpour...%K%P

0xE30
The rest of us are dumbfounded, and stare at the door%NIzumi-san ran out of.%K%P

0xE48
"Words can be the source of catastrophes...%NMakoto-kun."%K%P

0xE54
I recall Izumi-san's words from back then.%K%P

0xE60
(... Izumi-san.)%K%P

0xE6C
What should be my next course of action...?%K

0x1458
Chase after her.

0x1464
Stand still where I am.

0xEBC
Makoto「Izumi-san!!」%K%P

0xEE4
I fly out of the shop, chasing after Izumi-san as fast as%Nlightning!%K%P

0xEF0
My head is starting to clear up already.%K%P

0xF04
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xF10
I stand frozen in place.%K%P

0xF1C
The rage welling within me earlier was completely wiped%Nout from Izumi-san's slap, to the point where I've become%Nalmost unbelievably calm.%K%P

0xF28
But... I hesitate.%K%P

0xF34
What am I supposed to do in times like this?%K%P

0xF48
Yuka「Makoto... are you okay... with not going after her?」%K%P

0xF54
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xF68
Yuka「The Most Important Law of Professor Yuka's Love%NFormula: —'It's no use crying over spilt milk.'」%K%P

0xF74
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0xF88
(That's right... I have to go after her...)%K%P

0xF94
(At any rate, I have to go after Izumi-san...!)%K%P

0xFBC
I fly out of the shop, chasing after Izumi-san as fast as%Nlightning!%K%P

0xFC8
I'm no longer hesitant.%K%P
