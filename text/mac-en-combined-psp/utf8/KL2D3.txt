Today, Wednesday, April 3rd, was a peaceful, uneventful%Nday...%K%N

0x17C
When Haruka and I returned from fishing, Okuhiko was on%Nthe terrace, spouting his usual crap, but...%K%N

0x188
... Saki was nearby, but she calmly and silently passed%Nby as if nothing was happening.%K%N

0x194
Naturally, the basket remained unscathed as well.%K%P

0x1A8
Since Saki didn't fall into the ocean, she doesn't have%Nany feelings for Okuhiko. Thus, she didn't get angry.%K%N

0x1B4
That also means that no one knows that Haruka is a%Nclone.%K%N

0x1C0
I'm doubtful whether or not Saki even knew that.%K%N

0x1CC
Anyway, their relationship is peaceful this time around,%Nas if all their quarreling in the last history was all false...%K%P

0x1E0
Since Saki didn't almost drown... this peaceful day was%Nable to happen.%K%N

0x1EC
Everything's going well so far. There's nothing to worry%Nabout...%K%N%N

0x230
...After that, Izumi-san made curry for dinner, and it's%Ndecided that we'd go to the Test of Courage. This time,%NSaki's coming too.%K%P

0x244
...After that, Izumi-san made cream stew for dinner, and%Nit's decided that we'd go to the Test of Courage. This%Ntime, Saki's coming too.%K%P

0x258
...After that, Izumi-san made meat-potato stew for dinner,%Nand it's decided that we'd go to the Test of Courage.%NThis time, Saki's coming too.%K%P

0x264
After the Test of Courage, the others go to the hot%Nsprings...%K%N

0x270
Kurumi and I stay behind and watch "Oedo Gatten"%Ntogether... And then...%K%P

0x2C8
Kurumi「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x2D4
Kurumi「Do you want go somewhere interesting?」%K%P

0x2E8
... Naturally, I adamantly refuse that invitation, and act to%Nobstruct her.%K%P

0x2F4
I grasp Kurumi's palm tightly while continuing to watch%N"Oedo Gatten" to the end.%K%P

0x300
I think I might have overwhelmed her, as Kurumi didn't%Nbring it up after that.%K%P

0x30C
Before long, everyone returns from the hot springs, and%NKurumi and Izumi-san go home to Lunabeach...%K%P

0x318
And so...%K%P

0x3BC
... I am now lying down on my bed, staring at the dark%Nceiling.%K%P

0x3C8
Tomorrow is no doubt the most important day yet.%K%P

0x3D4
It's probably my only chance.%K%P

0x3E0
―My chance to solve all the mysteries.%K%P

0x3EC
I'll go to Lunabeach to help Izumi-san, and then... I'll ask%Nher for the truth!%K%P

0x3F8
About the shrine... about the kidnapping... about their link%Nby blood...%K%P

0x404
Up until now, there's been almost no opportunities to ask%Nher, and I can't ask her directly, seeing as how I'm not%Nsupposed to know that story yet.%K%P

0x410
All I can do is just wait for her to voluntarily tell it to me.%K%P

0x41C
And that time will come tomorrow.%K%P

0x428
However, if I wait until we're at the pier tomorrow%Nafternoon, it'll definitely be too late.%K%P

0x434
I have to ask her as early as possible. ―Maybe when%NKurumi's at Princess Beach, when we won't be%Ninterrupted...%K%P

0x440
―I want to know everything about Kurumi.%K%P

0x44C
That way, I won't make the same mistake again...%K%P
