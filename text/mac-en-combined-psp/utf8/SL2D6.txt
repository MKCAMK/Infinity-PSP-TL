It's already been almost an hour since Yuka's room went%Nquiet.%K%P

0x160
Before I knew it, the sound of rainfall had started%Nresounding outside the lodge.%K%P

0x16C
I glance at the cuckoo clock.%K%P

0x178
It's around this time that I heard the sound of that bell...%K%P

0x194
―Just then, at that time!%K%N

0x1BC
I hear something striking a window, but it's hard to%Npinpoint which window it is.%K%P

0x1C8
My body becomes tense...%K%P

0x1D4
I strain my ears as I search in the darkness for the%Nsource of the sound.%K%P

0x1FC
Saki「Makoto-kun... Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x208
It's Saki's voice.%K%N

0x214
I heard it coming from my room.%K%P

0x220
I jump off the sofa and rush into my room...%K%P

0x290
No one's here.%K%N

0x29C
I don't hear her voice anymore.%K%N

0x2A8
The sound of the window being tapped on has stopped%Nas well.%K%P

0x2FC
I open the ceiling window, and raise my body up there.%K%P

0x308
The sound of the rainfall becomes a deafening roar, and%Nmy upper body gets completely soaked in mere%Nseconds.%K%P

0x314
I stare out into the darkness while squinting my eyes in%Nthe rain.%K%P

0x320
There's no sign of anyone there.%K%P

0x348
I jump down to the top of my bed, and shut the window.%K%P

0x354
―And at the same time, I hear the front door closing!%K%P

0x38C
Dammit!!%K%P

0x414
I burst out of my room with the force of a bullet.%K%P

0x420
There's no one in the living room.%K%P

0x42C
I open the front door and rush outside.%K%P

0x480
I hear the tapping sound of someone running down the%Nstaircase.%K%P

0x48C
I lean forward on the terrace and look down.%K%P

0x498
In my field of vision, I can see a girl running.%K%P

0x4A4
―It's Saki!%K%P

0x4B0
Saki is fiercely running towards the forest path in the%Nmiddle of the downpour.%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「SAKI!!!」%K%P

0x4C8
I shout as loud as I can.%K%N

0x4D4
She can't hear me, though.%K%N

0x4E0
The violent roar of the rain has drowned my voice out.%K%P

0x4EC
That's when I notice something.%K%P

0x4F8
Looking at Saki from above, I can see that she's holding%Nsomething against her chest.%K%P

0x504
Holding... something...%K%P

0x510
No way... it can't be...%K%P

0x51C
So... the thief really was... Saki!?%K%P

0x57C
I rush down the stairs, plunging into the downpour.%K%P

0x594
Near the entrance of the forest path, I see two bright%Nred lights.%K%P

0x5A0
It's the taxi...%K%P

0x5AC
Saki's ponytail sways as she runs towards it.%K%P

0x5D4
... Saki gets in.%K%P

0x5E0
The headlights turn on, illuminating the countless falling%Nraindrops in the darkness.%K%P

0x608
... The taxi starts driving away in unison with the sound%Nof exhaust coming from its pipe.%K%P

0x614
The bright red tail lights of the taxi get farther and%Nfarther away, and the sound of the tires driving on%Ngravel is eventually drowned away by the rain...%K%P

0x6BC
Izumi「WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!!?」%K%P

0x6C8
The next morning... I stagger to the living room when I%Nhear Izumi-san's scream.%K%P

0x72C
I watch blankly as Izumi-san overturns her handbag with%Na pale face.%K%P

0x738
Okuhiko「What's wrong?」%K%P

0x74C
Izumi「Yesterday's proceeds... they're all gone!」%K%P

0x768
Kurumi「Onee-chan, did you look thoroughly?」%K%P

0x784
Izumi「Of course!」%K%P

0x7A0
Yuka「Did you possibly put them down in a different place?」%K%P

0x7BC
Izumi「No way. This is the only place they'd be!」%K%P

0x7D8
Okuhiko「If that's the case, then they were stolen. That's the only%Npossibility I can think of...」%K%P

0x7F4
Yuka「What should we do?」%K%P

0x808
Okuhiko「Actually, there's something bugging me.」%K%P

0x81C
Yuka「What?」%K%P

0x838
Kurumi「More importantly, we need to inform the police!」%K%P

0x84C
Yuka「You're right. Anyway, the police...」%K%P

0x860
I pay no attention to their conversation.%K%P

0x86C
After what happened last night, I couldn't sleep, as all I%Ncould think about was Saki.%K%P

0x878
Just what was it... that Saki was holding against her%Nchest last night...?%K%P

0x884
It couldn't be...%K%N

0x890
No, that's impossible!%K%N

0x89C
I'm definitely making a mistake!%K%P

0x8A8
... Saki will come soon.%K%P

0x8B4
When she does, what should I do...?%K%P

0x8C0
I have to make sure that things don't get screwed up%Nagain!!!%K%P

0x8DC
Saki「Pardon my intrusion! Makoto-kun, are you there?」%K%P

0x90C
Finally, Saki comes. She wipes the raindrops out of her%Nhair...%K%P

0x918
Saki「Sorry for barging in like this, but it's really pouring out%Nthere. Sorry, but could I borrow a towel?」%K%P

0x924
Yuka heads towards the kitchen.%K%N

0x930
Izumi-san slightly raises her head and looks at Saki.%K%P

0x93C
Okuhiko glances at Saki.%K%N

0x948
Kurumi looks at Saki without lifting her head.%K%P

0x954
Only Haruka's behavior feels slightly different from last%Ntime.%K%P

0x968
Saki「Ah, Makoto-kun, glad you're here. I have something to tell%Nyou.」%K%P

0x974
This is the second time I've seen her face like this.%K%P

0x980
She's beaming, as if something good happened to make%Nher happy...%K%P

0x98C
Is it because she's happy about taking the money...?%K%N

0x998
Dumbass! Why the hell am I thinking something so stupid!?%K%P

0x9AC
Saki「Huh? Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x9B8
Saki tilts her head questioningly as she surveys her%Nsurroundings.%K%P

0x9D4
Yuka「A thief broke in.」%K%P

0x9F0
Saki「What? A thief...」%K%P

0x9FC
Okuhiko「You came here in the dead of night last night, right? I%Nsaw it. I saw you just as you left the lodge. And where%Ndid you go on that taxi you got into?」%K%P

0xA18
Yuka「Is that true?」%K%P

0xA34
Saki「I-I...」%K%P

0xA50
Okuhiko「You can't say you don't know about it. There was%Nanother witness...」%K%P

0xA7C
Yuka「Who?」%K%P

0xA98
Okuhiko「Ishihara... Would you please tell us exactly what you%Nsaw?」%K%P

0xAB4
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you saw it?」%K%P

0xAC0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xADC
Yuka「What did you see?」%K%P

0xAF0
Okuhiko「You chased her outside, didn't you? You should have%Nseen her face as well...」%K%P

0xB04
Yuka「Makoto, you chased her?」%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「N-No, I...」%K%P

0xB24
Okuhiko「Would you stop lying?」%K%P

0xB30
I lower my head, fully aware of the others' piercing glares.%K%P

0xB3C
I look towards Saki.%K%N

0xB48
She is staring straight into my eyes.%K%P

0xB54
Makoto「... Yeah, I definitely followed them...」%K%P

0xB70
Izumi「Who was it?」%K%P

0xB84
Yuka「Who!?」%K%P

0xBA0
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xBCC
Haruka「...」%K

0x1EA8
Saki didn't steal anything!

0x1EB4
I don't know...

0xC0C
Makoto「Saki didn't steal anything!」%K%P

0xC28
Okuhiko「What was that?」%K%P

0xC34
Makoto「Saki definitely isn't the kind of person who would do that!」%K%P

0xC40
Saki「...」%K%P

0xC54
Okuhiko「But don't you think she's acting weird?」%K%P

0xC60
Makoto「... It's true... It's true that last night, I saw Saki get into a%Ntaxi.」%K%P

0xC6C
Makoto「But while that may be true, it doesn't necessarily mean%Nthat Saki's the culprit!」%K%P

0xC78
Makoto「No! That's impossible!」%K%P

0xC8C
Okuhiko「Then what was she doing?」%K%P

0xC98
Makoto「'What'... that doesn't matter, does it!?」%K%P

0xCAC
Okuhiko「I don't like this... look, you can see the concern written on%Neveryone's faces.」%K%P

0xCC8
Yuka「Makoto... what is the meaning of this? If you know, then%Nexplain it.」%K%P

0xCD4
Makoto「Y-Yuka...」%K%P

0xCE8
Izumi「Saki-chan... can I ask you one thing? ... Was it you?」%K%P

0xD04
Kurumi「Will you tell us? Will you tell us the truth?」%K%P

0xD10
Saki averts her eyes. She purses her lips, and clenches%Nher hands into fists.%K%P

0xD1C
Makoto「Izumi-san, Kurumi... how could you say that!?」%K%P

0xD38
Saki「...」%K%P

0xD44
Makoto「Can't you trust her without an explanation!? Do you%Nreally need words in order to trust her!?」%K%P

0xD50
Haruka「I'm... different.」%K%P

0xD5C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xD68
Haruka「I...」%K%P

0xD90
Saki「That's enough! Stop!」%K%P

0xD9C
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0xDA8
Saki「Enough already!」%K%P

0xDB4
Saki「All humans are the same!!」%K%P

0xDC8
Makoto「Saki!!」%K%P

0xDD4
Saki turns around, and starts running towards the front%Ndoor.%K%P

0xDE0
Just as I'm about to go pursue her... Haruka mutters this.%K%P

0xDF4
Haruka「Makoto... I... trust Saki.」%K%P

0xE00
Her words slowly sink into my heart.%K%P

0xE0C
I give Haruka a firm nod, then immediately pursue Saki...%K%P

0xE30
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xE3C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xE58
Okuhiko「Hey! Ishihara!」%K%P

0xE64
Makoto「I don't know... I don't know!」%K%P

0xE78
I just want to scream that she's innocent...%K%P

0xE84
"You're wrong! It wasn't Saki!" ―I want to so badly, but I%Ncan't.%K%P

0xE90
That person I saw last night was definitely Saki.%K%N

0xE9C
That's why I can't cover for her. Even though I want to%Ntrust her, I can't.%K%P

0xEA8
I don't know what to do.%K%P

0xEB4
My mind is scrambled, and I lose the ability to make any%Nsound judgements.%K%P

0xEC8
Okuhiko「Whatever... Judging from your behavior, you don't even%Nneed to say anything for me to know...」%K%P

0xED4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xEE0
Okuhiko「Saki-chan! What were you doing here last night!?」%K%P

0xEFC
Saki「I didn't do it.」%K%P

0xF08
Saki「... I didn't steal anything!」%K%P

0xF24
Okuhiko「If that's the case, then why don't you tell us what you%Nwere doing?」%K%P

0xF40
Saki「I don't know anything!」%K%P

0xF5C
Okuhiko「There's no way you don't know about what you did!」%K%P

0xF78
Saki「I don't know what I don't know!」%K%P

0xF94
Izumi「Saki-chan... can I ask you one thing? ... Was it you?」%K%P

0xFB0
Kurumi「Will you tell us? Will you tell us the truth?」%K%P

0xFC4
Saki averts her eyes. She purses her lips, and clenches%Nher hands into fists.%K%P

0xFD8
Makoto「... Saki...」%K%P

0xFE4
I finally manage to wring my voice out.%K%P

0xFF0
Saki looks towards me.%K%P

0xFFC
Her desperate gaze is begging me to help her...%K%P

0x1010
Saki「Makoto-kun... you trust me, right?」%K%P

0x101C
Makoto「Y-Yeah... I trust you...」%K%P

0x1030
Saki「... You're lying!」%K%P

0x103C
Makoto「I'm not...」%K%P

0x1050
Saki「If you're not lying, then why aren't you saying anything!?%NWhy aren't you saying it wasn't me!?」%K%P

0x105C
Makoto「Th-That's...」%K%P

0x1068
Makoto「Saki... Even... Even I want to trust you! But...」%K%P

0x1074
Saki「So you too can't really trust me unless I use words!?」%K%P

0x1080
Saki slowly shakes her head...%K%P

0x108C
Saki「You're the same, Makoto... All humans are the same!!」%K%P

0x10A0
Saki turns back, and bursts out the front door.%K%P

0x10AC
Makoto「Saki!!」%K%P

0x115C
Saki begins to descend the forest path, which has%Npractically changed into a marsh, as if she's tumbling%Ndown.%K%P

0x1168
I desperately chase after her.%K%P

0x11A0
I keep running against the pouring rain.%K%P

0x11AC
Will history repeat itself after all...?%K%P

0x11E4
No... I definitely won't let that happen!%K%P

0x11F0
I'll definitely prevent it!%K%P

0x11FC
Saki... I don't want to lose you...%K%P

0x1244
The tip of the cape... the dead end...%K%P

0x1250
Saki grips the fence with her back turned to me.%K%P

0x125C
I hear the sound of waves breaking at the bottom of the%Ncliff.%K%P

0x1268
The cold rain intensely beats down on Saki's back.%K%P

0x1274
Makoto「SAKI!!!」%K%P

0x1280
As I shout, I run to her.%K%P

0x128C
Saki doesn't try to answer or turn around...%K%N

0x1298
... She then crosses over the boundary of the dead end.%K%P

0x1320
Saki「Stay away!」%K%P

0x132C
Saki「Don't get any closer!」%K%P

0x1338
I come to a halt.%K%P

0x1344
The fiercely blowing wind waves through Saki's hair.%K%P

0x1350
Saki「It's as I've thought this whole time...」%K%P

0x135C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x1378
Saki「No one even gives a shit about me...」%K%P

0x1384
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1390
Saki「That's why I don't trust people. I can't trust them... I don't%Nwant to trust them...」%K%P

0x139C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1EC0
I'm here because I trust you.

0x1ECC
Trust me.

0x1430
Makoto「Saki... listen...」%K%P

0x143C
Makoto「I didn't come all the way here because I wanted you to%Ntrust me...」%K%P

0x1448
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1454
Makoto「It's because I trust you, Saki... that's why I came here!!」%K%P

0x1460
Saki「!!」%K%P

0x146C
Saki「... Why? ... Why are you sticking up for me?」%K%P

0x1478
Makoto「Because I trust you... Because I trust you completely,%NSaki...」%K%P

0x1484
Saki「You're lying!」%K%P

0x1490
Makoto「I'm not lying!」%K%P

0x149C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x14A8
Makoto「Didn't I tell you? You don't need words...」%K%P

0x14B4
Saki「...」%K%P

0x14C0
Makoto「From now on, I'll... I'll be your cat and tree... I said that,%Nright...?」%K%P

0x14CC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x14D8
Makoto「And besides... you now have a reason to 'trust' people!」%K%P

0x14E4
Saki is breathlessly taken aback.%K%N

0x14F0
She purses her lips tightly.%K%N

0x14FC
Tears are pouring from her wide eyes down her cheeks.%K%P

0x1508
Saki「But... but...!」%K%P

0x1514
Makoto「Saki... you're such an idiot...」%K%P

0x1520
Saki is sobbing.%K%P

0x152C
I slowly approach her...%K%N

0x1538
... and embrace her from the other side of the fence.%K%P

0x1544
Just like that, I carefully lift Saki up and pull her towards%Nme...%K%P

0x1584
Saki「Makoto-kun...!」%K%P

0x1590
With those words, Saki rubs her cheek against my chest.%NIt's embarrassing...%K%P

0x159C
That gesture is very sweet and lovely.%K%P

0x15A8
The tip of Saki's nose touches my chest, tickling me.%K%P

0x15B4
Saki hugs me as if she's regained something she's lost...%K%P

0x15C0
I gently return her embrace to answer her feelings.%K%P

0x15CC
I want to accept Saki's entirety.%K%N

0x15D8
I want to feel all of it wrapping around my heart.%K%P

0x15E4
"You don't need words."%K%N

0x15F0
Saki's feelings are directly reaching my heart.%K%P

0x15FC
Mine are definitely reaching hers...%K%P

0x1608
In the beating rain, we bring our lips together, and%Nconfirm our feelings for each other together...%K%P

0x165C
Makoto「Saki... trust me!」%K%P

0x1668
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1674
Makoto「I don't care if you don't trust anyone else.」%K%P

0x1680
Makoto「But I want you to trust me alone!」%K%P

0x168C
Saki「I don't trust people. I can't trust them... I don't want to%Ntrust them!」%K%P

0x1698
Saki repeats the same words she did last time.%K%P

0x16A4
Saki「I was also lying to you.」%K%P

0x16B0
Saki「I didn't trust you.」%K%P

0x16BC
Saki quietly raises her dangling left hand, and opens it.%K%P

0x16C8
Lying there... in her palm is...%K%P

0x16DC
... That's... impossible...%K%P

0x16E8
Why... is that bell...%K%P

0x16F4
I definitely threw it away from this park, so why...%K%P

0x1708
I stagger towards her, completely baffled by this turn of%Nevents.%K%P

0x1714
Saki「I told you not to get any closer!」%K%P

0x1720
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x172C
Saki「Stay away!」%K%P

0x1738
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1744
Saki「Don't get any closer, or I'll really...」%K%P

0x1750
I slowly approach Saki in my dim sense of%Nconsciousness.%K%P

0x175C
I take another firm step... and at that instant!%K%P

0x1778
Saki lets go of the fence with her right hand.%K%P

0x1784
She gently closes her eyes...%K%P

0x1790
... Her body leans backwards.%K%P

0x179C
The bell slips and falls from her now powerless left hand...%K%P

0x17F0
And like that, she falls.%K%P

0x17FC
She falls into the pitch black, alluring darkness...%K%P

0x1808
Like a scrap of paper dancing in the wind...%K%P

0x1814
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1820
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0x182C
Makoto「Why... Saki...」%K%P

0x1838
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x1844
I lose all strength in my body...%K%P

0x1850
I stagger forward like I'm being drawn in...%K%N

0x185C
... And chase... after Saki...%K%P
