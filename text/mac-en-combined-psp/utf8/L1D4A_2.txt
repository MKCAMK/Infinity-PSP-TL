I walk into the dining room to see Yuka and Haruka eating%Nbreakfast.%K%P

0xDC
Makoto「Huh? Who made the sandwiches?」%K%P

0xF0
Yuka「Ah, Makoto... Can't you at least say 'good morning' first?」%K%P

0xFC
Makoto「R... Right... Good morning.」%K%P

0x110
Yuka「Good morning!」%K%P

0x12C

0x160
Kurumi「Right. Kurumi brought them over!」%K%P

0x16C

0x188
Yuka「That's right.」%K%P

0x194
Makoto「Wow, Izumi-san's such a gracious person...」%K%P

0x1A0
As I say this, I grab a ham and mozzarella cheese%Nsandwich with one hand and take a bite.%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「... D... Damn, that's good!」%K%P

0x1C0
Yuka「Geez, you have such poor manners. Sit down properly%Nand eat!」%K%P

0x1CC
Damn it, she complains about every little thing...%K%P

0x278
Makoto「Whew... That was delicious. I'm done!」%K%P

0x284
There is a big plate on the table with just a few parsley%Nleaves scattered all over it.%K%P

0x290
Makoto「Huh? Now that I think about it, I don't see Okuhiko%Nanywhere... Where did he go?」%K%P

0x2A4
Yuka「He left before Kurumi-chan arrived, saying he was going%Nto take a walk.」%K%P

0x2B0
Makoto「Hmm, I see...」%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「Hey, Yuka?」%K%P

0x2C8
Yuka「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「What's on today's schedule?」%K%P

0x2E0
Yuka「Oh, today? Since this is the middle of the Seminar, we're%Nfree to do what we want.」%K%P

0x2EC
Makoto「Free to do what we want? You're saying that, but we've%Nbasically been doing things like that every day, haven't%Nwe?」%K%P

0x2F8
Yuka「Well, I guess that's true.」%K%P

0x304
Yuka「But we're even freer today than usual.」%K%P

0x310
Yuka「Everyone can go wherever they want. After all, going off%Nby yourself and doing what you want isn't bad every%Nnow and then...」%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「Oh, I see.」%K%P

0x328
Yuka「Ah, I almost forgot to tell you, but this only lasts up until%N5:00 today.」%K%P

0x334
Makoto「Up until 5:00...?」%K%P

0x340
Yuka「Right. At 5:00, everyone has to be at Lunabeach.」%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「What's going on at 5:00?」%K%P

0x360
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x374
Yuka「... That's a S-E-C-R-E-T♪」%K%P

0x380
Makoto「Huh? Seriously, what is it?」%K%P

0x394
Yuka「Now now... Just look forward to it and find out for yourself!」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Hmph. Well, whatever.」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「Anyway, I've got some business to take care of. I'll see%Nyou all later.」%K%P

0x3D0
I inform Yuka, Haruka, and Kurumi of this, return to my room%Nto get the basket, and leave the lodge...%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「... So? What are you planning on doing, Yuka?」%K%P

0x404
Yuka「I was thinking of going to see the cherry blossoms...」%K%P

0x420
Haruka「Cherry blossoms... so they have those around here too...」%K%P

0x42C
Yuka「Yeah. I heard it from Izumi-san yesterday. She told me%Nthat there are cherry blossom trees on the road to%NViewpoint Park.」%K%P

0x448
Ah... Now that she mentions it, that's right...%K%P

0x454
I passed them when I followed Kurumi to that park...%K%P

0x460
At that time, I was so absorbed in following Kurumi that I%Ndidn't really notice them, but I'm sure that on the road to%Nthat cape, I saw cherry blossoms in full bloom.%K%P

0x46C
Yuka「I've heard that this is the best time around here to see%Nthem, and I probably won't get a chance to see them%Nwhen I get home, so...」%K%P

0x478
Makoto「Oh ho... Cherry blossoms, huh...」%K%P

0x484
Watching the cherry blossoms falling... that might be%Nquite a beautiful sight...%K%P

0x490
Makoto「Well then, what about you, Haruka? Where are you going?」%K%P

0x4AC
Kurumi「Well, Kurumi is going to Princess Beach...」%K

0xED8
Shout "I didn't ask you!"

Hear her out.

0x4F4
Kurumi「Kurumi is going to Princess Beach... to catch crabs!」%K%P

0x5AC
Wait, what the hell is "Crab sumo"!? Well, it's pretty%Nself-explanatory, but...%K%P

0x5C0
Makoto「All right then, Haruka, where are you going?」%K%P

0x5D4

0x630
Makoto「Oh, really?」%K%P

0x63C
Makoto「I'm kinda jealous of that crab!」%K%P

0x650
It's about time I got strict...%K%P

0x664
Makoto「By the way, what are you doing, Haruka?」%K%P

0x678
Kurumi「Kurumi will, umm, umm... ummm...」%K%P

0x6AC
Makoto「I didn't ask you!」%K%P

0x6B8
I immediately scold her.%K%P

0x6E8
Kurumi「Ah... Y-You meanie!!」%K%P

0x6FC
Kurumi「Fine, screw you, Onii-chan! Hmph!」%K%P

0x720
Mmph... I might have been a bit too harsh with her...%K%P

0x72C
But I can always make up with Kurumi later. Anyway...%K%P

0x754
Makoto「So, where are you going today, Haruka?」%K%P

0x760
... I ask Haruka this with a straight face.%K%P

0x774
Haruka「I'm... going fishing...」%K%P

0x780
Makoto「I see, fishing, huh?」%K%P

0x794
(One way or another, it seems Haruka had a lot of fun%Nyesterday...)%K%P

0x7A0
... Hmm, I see.%K%P

0x7AC
Yuka will go watch the cherry blossoms, Kurumi is going%Nto Princess Beach, and Haruka is going fishing...%K%P

0x7B8
Izumi-san is working at Lunabeach today. Come to think%Nof it, there's something about Kurumi that I'd be%Ninterested in asking her.%K%P

0x7C4
Well then...%K%P

0x7D0
Where should I go?%K

Go fishing.

0x858
Yuka「... I'll be going now.」%K%P

0x864
Makoto「Ah, hold on!」%K%P

0x878
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x884
Makoto「Can I come with you?」%K%P

0x890
Yuka「'Come with me'... to see the cherry blossoms?」%K%P

0x89C
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x8A8
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x8BC
Yuka「No way!」%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka「If I said that, what would you do?」%K

0xF50
"If you did, I'd just go somewhere else."

0xF5C
"I'd go there no matter what you said."

0x910
Makoto「If you said that-」%K%P

0x924
Makoto「No matter what you said-」%K%P

0x930
Yuka「Gotcha. That was a lie, a joke!」%K%P

0x93C
Yuka「Then let's go see the cherry blossoms together!」%K%P

0x950
Is she... teasing me?%K%P

0x95C
It's difficult to tell from that grin of hers.%K%P

0x968
Yuka「All right then, we're off♪」%K%P

0x974
Makoto「Haruka, Kurumi, see you later.」%K%P

0x980
We say goodbye to Kurumi and Haruka, then leave the%Nlodge...%K%P

0x9DC
I decide to go with Kurumi to Princess Beach.%K%P

0x9E8
However, before I know it, Kurumi is nowhere to be found.%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「Heeey, Kurumi～?」%K%P

0xA00
... Huh? Where'd she go?%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「Kurumi～ Kurumi～? Kurumi-chaa～n?」%K%P

0xA44
I look for her.%K%P

0xA50
I look in the bedrooms, the loft, the kitchen, the bathroom,%Nthe restroom... Even the garbage can, just to be safe...%K%P

0xA5C
She's nowhere to be found. At least, nowhere inside.%K%P

0xA68
... Oh, right...%K%P

0xA74
I put on my shoes and go out the front door...%K%P

0xAB0
I decide to go fishing with Haruka.%K%P

0xABC
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Would it be okay if I went fishing with you?」%K%P

0xAC8
Haruka nods as a "yes." She seems to be a little%Nembarrassed as a faint smile forms on her face...%K%P

0xAD4
Makoto「Well then, I'll go get ready... Wait for me!」%K%P

0xB0C
I return to my room after telling her this.%K%P

0xB44
... When I've finished changing in my room, I hurry back to%Nthe living room...%K%P

0xB50
... For some reason, Haruka isn't there.%K%P

0xB5C
Just then, I hear an argument going on outside the front%Ndoor.%K%P

0xB68
One of them is Saki... the other is...%K%P

0xB74
―Haruka.%K%P

0xB80
I have a very bad feeling about this, so I quickly open%Nthe front door.%K%P

0xBDC
Okay, I'll help Izumi-san out today.%K%P

0xBE8
Even I should be able to do stuff like dishwashing and%Nsweeping.%K%P

0xBF4
As for Yuka, Haruka, and Kurumi...%K%P

0xC00
Makoto「Well then, see you later.」%K%P

0xC0C
... I say goodbye to them, and head for Lunabeach...%K%P
