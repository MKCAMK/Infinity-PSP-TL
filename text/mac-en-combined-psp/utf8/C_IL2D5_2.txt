—The next day.%K%N

0x68
I'm visiting Lunabeach again.%K%P

0x74
As usual, there are no customers.%K%P

0x80
Izumi-san lays her hands on the table while blankly%Nstaring out at the dark ocean.%K%P

0x94
Izumi「The weather's not looking good...」%K%P

0xA0
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xAC
Izumi「The earlier weather forecast said that 'It will start raining%Ntonight.」%K%P

0xB8
Makoto「Ha ha, looks like they're right for a change.」%K%P

0xCC
Izumi「Hee hee hee, that's true.」%K%P

0xD8
Izumi「It certainly will rain tomorrow, won't it?」%K%P

0xEC
Izumi「... Huh? ... Was the way I said that a bit weird?」%K%P

0x100
A smile rises to my face, and I shake my head.%K%P

0x114
Izumi-san returns the smile, and stares off towards the%Nsky.%K%P

0x120
The thick, grey clouds are low in the sky...%K%P

0x12C
Just like the last 5th, the scenery is colorless.%K%P

0x140
Izumi「Rain, huh...?」%K%P

0x14C
She mutters this with a sigh.%K%P

0x158
Makoto「But I thought you liked rain, Izumi-san.」%K%P

0x164
Izumi「Yes... I like rain itself.」%K%P

0x170
Izumi「But when I think of tomorrow's rain... I remember... you%Nknow...」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「... Are you nervous?」%K%P

0x188
Izumi-san nods while looking at the dark sky.%K%P

0x194
Makoto「It's all right! There's nothing to worry about!」%K%P

0x1A0
Makoto「Tomorrow, if the two of us stay closed up in this shop,%Nnothing should happen!」%K%P

0x1AC
Izumi「... You think so?」%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x1C4
Izumi「Makoto-kun... do you really think that?」%K

0x910
I do.

0x91C
I don't.

0x20C
Makoto「Yeah!」%K%P

0x218
I loudly declare this without a second thought.%K%P

0x224
Izumi「But remember what you said earlier?」%K%P

0x238
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x244
I'm unable to answer.%K%P

0x250
Izumi-san has seen through my "bluff".%K%P

0x25C
It's already too late to offer a rebuttal.%K%P

0x268
Izumi「Remember what you said earlier?」%K%P

0x274
Izumi「'For all we know, we could time travel again on the 6th at%Nthat time even if we're sleeping in our beds.%NNevertheless, in the end, no one knows if 'we will or won't%Ntime travel'...」%K%P

0x280
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x294
Izumi「We really don't know anything...」%K%P

0x2A0
Izumi「About the true nature of the time travel... or its cause...」%K%P

0x2AC
Izumi-san is certainly right.%K%P

0x2B8
The two of us don't believe the hypothesis of the%NIzumi-san as a psychologist—that this reality is a%Ndelusion.%K%P

0x2C4
Then what is the true cause of the time travel?%K%P

0x2D0
In the end, Izumi-san and I know nothing.%K%P

0x2DC
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x2E8
Izumi「What if... what if, at that time...」%K%P

0x2F4
Izumi「If someone besides us dies... What do you think will%Nhappen?」%K%P

0x300
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x30C
Izumi「Would we still time travel then?」%K%P

0x318
Makoto「That's...」%K%P

0x32C
Izumi「Then, what if it happens at a different time?」%K%P

0x338
Izumi「What if, instead of during the day, we fall off the cliff in a%Nsimilar incident at night... If that happened, what would%Nhappen then?」%K%P

0x344
I can't answer her.%K%P

0x350
Since I don't know the true cause of the time travel, I%Ncan't deny Izumi-san's words.%K%P

0x35C
However...%K%N

0x368
However, right now... the bell is gone... That's the only%Nthing that gives me peace of mind.%K%P

0x374
If that bell is gone, then even if something happens, the%Nexact same history shouldn't repeat itself.%K%P

0x380
That's why...%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x398
Makoto「About that bell...」%K%P

0x3A4
... I decide to give it my all by asking her.%K%P

0x3B8
Izumi「Bell...?」%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「Izumi-san, you don't have that bell, do you?」%K%P

0x3D0
Izumi-san purses her lips, and puts her hand into her%Npocket.%K%P

0x3DC
She firmly grasps something, pulls it out of her pocket%Nslowly, and places it on the table.%K%P

0x3F0
Izumi「I got this from Kurumi... yesterday.」%K%P

0x3FC
She quietly opens her palm while saying this.%K%P

0x410
—It's star sand.%K%N

0x41C
Specifically, it's a "star sand" in a small glass bottle.%K%P

0x428
Izumi「Yes... it's not that bell.」%K%P

0x434
That's what Kurumi picked up at Princess Beach%Nyesterday... It's a star sand, not the bell.%K%P

0x440
I breathe a sigh of relief.%K%P

0x45C
(But... nevertheless, where is that bell now...?)%K%P

0x468
Should I tell Izumi-san...?%K

0x928
Mention the bell's disappearance.

0x934
Don't mention it.

0x4C0
... I'll tell her about the bell.%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「Izumi-san... the truth is...」%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「I... found the bell... on the night of the 1st.」%K%P

0x4EC
Izumi「... Huh?」%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「I found it on Moon Beach, just like last time... and tried to%Nsmash it with a piece of concrete.」%K%P

0x504
Makoto「I tried to smash it into pieces... so that it would never%Nappear before me ever again...」%K%P

0x518
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「But... when I flipped the concrete over...」%K%P

0x530
Makoto「... It was gone...」%K%P

0x53C
Izumi「The bell... disappeared?」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「... Yes.」%K%P

0x55C
Izumi「The bell... disappeared...」%K%P

0x568
Izumi-san repeats herself.%K%P

0x574
She vacantly stares into space, motionless like a stone.%K%P

0x580
Her face is drained of color.%K%P

0x58C
It's as if I'm looking at an old photograph.%K%P

0x598
Makoto「No, but you see, it was night, so everything was dark...」%K%P

0x5A4
Makoto「When it was hit by the concrete, the pieces must have%Nflown far away!」%K%P

0x5B0
I try to rationalize the situation while looking at%NIzumi-san's serious expression.%K%P

0x5BC
Makoto「Anyway, the bell's already gone...」%K%P

0x5C8
Makoto「I don't have it, and you don't have it.」%K%P

0x5D4
Makoto「I don't think any of the others have it either...」%K%P

0x5E0
Makoto「—So that means it's absolutely impossible for the%Nsame event to repeat itself!」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「That's why...」%K%P

0x5F8
Makoto「That's why it's all right!」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「There's nothing to be worried about!」%K%P

0x628
... I won't tell her about the bell's disappearance.%K%P

0x634
At this rate, there's no need give her anything more to%Nworry about.%K%P

0x640
Makoto「So nothing should happen after all!」%K%P

0x64C
I try to act as cheerful as possible.%K%P

0x658
Makoto「If that bell is gone, then even if something happens, the%Nexact same history can't repeat itself!」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「It's all right! Don't worry, everything will be okay!」%K%P

0x694
When she hears me, a faint smile appears on Izumi-san's%Nlips.%K%P

0x6A0
Makoto「That's right! Smile!」%K%P

0x6AC
Makoto「Come on, just like you did at the barbecue!」%K%P

0x6C0
As I say this, I lightly pinch Izumi-san's cheeks with my%Nhands.%K%P

0x6CC
Even I don't really know why I chose to do such a thing.%K%P

0x6D8
I just want Izumi-san to smile.%K%P

0x6E4
I want to see her look at me with her usual kind smile.%K%P

0x6F0
... I pinch and stretch her squishy cheeks, making her%Nface look comical.%K%P

0x6FC
I swirl the eyebrows above her questioning eyes.%K%P

0x708
Makoto「P... Pffft...」%K%P

0x714
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x720
Makoto「Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x72C
I'm the first one to laugh.%K%P

0x738
Izumi「Geez, don't play with people's faces!」%K%P

0x744
Although she says this, Izumi-san's smile returns.%K%P

0x750
Izumi「Take this!」%K%P

0x75C
Izumi-san pinches my cheeks with her fingers.%K%P

0x768
Izumi「Hee hee... hee hee hee hee...」%K%P

0x774
Izumi「Ahahahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x780
Izumi-san and I... pinch each other's cheeks while%Nlaughing so hard that we're crying.%K%P

0x7A4
Just then...%K%P

0x7B8
Kurumi「Good morning—♪」%K%P

0x7CC
Kurumi「... Huh?」%K%P

0x7D8
Kurumi「What are you two doing...?」%K%P

0x7E4
Kurumi descends from the second floor, and quickly%Nopens her mouth.%K%P
