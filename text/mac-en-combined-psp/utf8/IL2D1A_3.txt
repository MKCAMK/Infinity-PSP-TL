Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x94
9:34 A.M.―right on schedule. Okuhiko wakes up at the%Nsame time he did on the 1st.%K%P

0xA0
Of course, that's only natural. He himself is trying to%Ndeceive me, after all...%K%P

0xBC
Okuhiko「Huh? I'm not... interrupting something, am I?」%K%P

0xC8
He asks this to Haruka as he ignores my presence.%K%P

0xD4
Of course, she doesn't answer him.%K%P

0xF8
Okuhiko「... Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x10C
While laughing, he glares at me again.%K%P

0x118
His eyes are full with scorn...%K%P

0x12C
The scene unfolding before my eyes is the same as that%Nday.%K%P

0x138
It's a truly strange sight.%K%P

0x144
He loudly yawns as he slowly walks towards the sofa%Nbefore sitting down.%K%P

0x150
He remembers to keep 50 cm between him and Haruka.%K%P

0x15C
It's something he remembers quite well.%K I'm honestly%Nimpressed.%K%P

0x168
Okuhiko is really serious in going all out to try to make%Nthis trick work on me.%K%N

0x174
You could call him a "despicable bastard", for that, but...%K%P

0x180
It must be really difficult to repeat the exact same%Nactions. I must commend him.%K%P

0x18C
If I didn't know any better, I would have honestly felt like I%Nhad time traveled.%K%P

0x198
Nevertheless, all of us (myself included) are putting on a%Ntrue to life performance here.%K%P

0x1A4
Who knew we had this much acting talent? Perhaps we%Nshould join the drama club... or even consider acting as%Na career.%K%P

0x1B0
Makoto「Hey, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x1BC
I turn towards Okuhiko and say the same thing I did back%Nthen.%K%P

0x1D0
Okuhiko「Yeah?」%K%P

0x1DC
Makoto「It's just... What exactly are we trying to achieve at this%Nso-called 'Seminar Camp' here?」%K%P

0x200
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x20C
Makoto「Huh? ... What's wrong, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x218
Okuhiko「... Ishihara, didn't you ask me that before?」%K%P

0x224
Okuhiko was probably expecting me to ask, "What's%Ntoday's date?"%K%P

0x230
But instead, I asked the same question I did on the 1st.%K%P

0x23C
In addition, I'm not agitated or perturbed at all. I'm acting%Nas if nothing ever happened.%K%N

0x248
As a result, Okuhiko is surprised.%K%P

0x254
Makoto「... What are you talking about, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x260
Feigning ignorance, I unleash my counterattack.%K%P

0x274
Okuhiko「H-Hey, Ishihara... What's... today's date?」%K%P

0x280
Okuhiko is clearly uneasy.%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「Huh? It's April 1st, isn't it? Did you forget that already?」%K%P

0x298
I answer calmly. Right... calmly.%K%P

0x2C8
Okuhiko「Th... That's right... ahaha.」%K%P

0x2D4
Okuhiko begins to break out into a cold sweat. His face%Nis twitching a bit.%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「Hey, it's only the first day of the Camp, so what's wrong?%NHang in there, Okuhiko～」%K%P

0x2EC
I'm also putting on a stellar performance, if I may say so%Nmyself.%K%P

0x300
Okuhiko's face has gone pale. Heh heh heh... Serves you%Nright.%K%P

0x384
Yuka「Good morning!」%K%P

0x390
Yuka has "awoken". It's probably at the same time as the%N1st.%K%P

0x39C
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x3B8
Okuhiko「... H-Hey...」%K%P

0x3C4
Okuhiko and I return her greeting. Haruka, needless to%Nsay, doesn't reply at all.%K%P

0x3D0
Okuhiko's voice sounds slightly devoid of energy.%NObviously...%K%P

0x3EC
Yuka「Have any of you had breakfast yet?」%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「No, not yet...」%K%P

0x404
Yuka「I see. Well then, I guess I'll make some myself.」%K%P

0x410
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x41C
Yuka「What, do you have any complaints?」%K%P

0x428
Yuka's also doing a great job. Thanks to that, things are%Nhappening the same way they were last time.%K%P

0x444
Huh...? Happening the same way...?%K%P

0x450
H-Hold on. At this rate, the same events will unfold again,%Nmeaning...%K%P

0x478
―I'll have to suffer Yuka's cooking again!!!!%K%P

0x484
Yuka「I think it'll probably take about 15 minutes. Um, toast's%Nokay, right?」%K%P

0x498
And then I...%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「Hold it!!!」%K

0x1808
... say this.

0x1814
... barely avoid saying this.

0x500
A loud thud comes from my feet.%K%P

0x514
When I look, I see Haruka has used her heel to stomp on%Nmy foot with all of her strength.%K%P

0x528
Makoto「... O-OWWWWW!!!」%K%P

0x534
I jump up and down, holding my crushed foot. Tears rise%Nto my eyes.%K%P

0x548
Okuhiko「???」%K%P

0x554
Okuhiko looks suspicious.%K%P

0x570
Haruka quickly backs me up.%K%P

0x57C
Haruka「There was... this huge mosquito. ... It was about to suck%Nhis blood.」%K%P

0x588
... Well, it seems that Haruka might also be getting into this%Nwhole performance.%K%P

0x59C
Okuhiko「Huh.」%K%P

0x5A8
He seems to understand.%K%P

0x5B4
(Is this even the season for mosquitoes!?)%K%P

0x5C0
If I were to say this out loud, then I would feel like I was in%Nsome traditional comedy sketch, with me as the straight%Nman.%K%N

0x5CC
But... Though I'm tempted to say this, I don't want to get%Nstomped on again...%K%P

0x5D8
Haruka's fine... she'll sacrifice her breakfast if it means%Nrepeating the same history.%K%P

0x5E4
But there's no way I can get out of this...!%K%P

0x5F0
Just remembering that "food" makes my stomach churn...%K%P

0x604
I frantically swallow the words that almost come bursting%Nout of my mouth.%K%P

0x610
That was close...%K%P

0x61C
Haruka and Okuhiko are calm.%K%P

0x628
It's only natural. They'll sacrifice their breakfasts if it%Nmeans letting the same history play out.%K%P

0x634
But I'll be forced to eat that crap again!%K%P

0x640
Just remembering that "food" makes my stomach churn...%K%P

0x6A0
While waiting for Yuka to finish cooking, we watch "A%NHealthy YOUtopia" on the TV.%K%P

0x6AC
Needless to say, this isn't the episode that's airing now.%K%P

0x6B8
The images projected from the cathode ray tube right%Nnow are from Haruka's recording.%K%P

0x6C4
Okuhiko is so surprised that this episode is playing that%Nit seems his brain is frying.%K%P

0x6D0
At last, with that trump card, Okuhiko finally seems to%Nbelieve that today is the 1st.%K%P

0x700
Yuka「Sorry to keep you waiting～」%K%P

0x70C
Before long, Yuka's done cooking.%K%P

0x718
Yuka「I've already set the food on the table. Let's eat!」%K%P

0x724
No one even tries stands up in spite of those words.%K%P

0x730
Of course... we all know the result of her cooking...%K%P

0x744
Yuka「Huh～? What's wrong, guys? Weren't you hungry?」%K%P

0x750
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x75C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x768
Makoto「Th-That's right... we're starving... Come on, let's go eat♪」%K%P

0x774
I urge everyone on cheerfully in an attempt to cheer%Nmyself up, even if only slightly.%K%P

0x788
Yuka「Well then, go ahead and eat up～♪」%K%P

0x794
In the end, let's just say that Yuka's food drove me to%Nhell and back.%K%P

0x7A0
...%K%P

0x81C
Makoto「Ugh...」%K%P

0x828
I feel sick...%K%P

0x834
I can feel my chest and throat filling up with nausea.%K%P

0x840
I have once again become a victim of that sad excuse%Nfor food.%K%P

0x84C
I sink down deep into the sofa and stare at the living%Nroom's ceiling as I swear that "I'll never let Yuka cook%Never again!"%K%P

0x858
I swear this 42 times.%K%P

0x864
Like last time, Yuka is happily humming while washing the%Ndishes.%K%P

0x870
Haruka is also brushing her teeth, just like last time.%K%P

0x87C
But this time, Okuhiko isn't helping Yuka.%K%P

0x888
He seems to be in deep thought. The pose he's in%Nresembles Rodin's "The Thinker"...%K%P

0x8C0
Just then, the doorbell rings from the front door.%K%P

0x8CC
Is she here? ... I think this.%K%P

0x8D8
Kurumi has come to deliver the pizza.%K%P

0x938
Kurumi「Thank you for your continued patronage♪」%K%P

0x944
Kurumi「Here's the seafood pizza you ordered!」%K%P

0x950
Kurumi's also doing a good job at acting.%K%P

0x95C
If anyone saw her now, they'd think the Kurumi in front of%Nmy eyes was the Kurumi from the 1st.%K%P

0x978
Kurumi「Then, this isn't the Asakura house...」%K%P

0x984
After informing her that "No one here ordered pizza", a%Nsurprised look appears on Kurumi's face.%K%P

0x990
Makoto「No, there isn't anyone here name Asaku...」%K%P

0x99C
This is the part where Okuhiko shouts...%K%P

0x9A8
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x9C4
... Huh? He's not going to do it?%K%P

0x9D0
I stop talking, and sneak a glance at Okuhiko.%K%P

0xA08
Kurumi also tries peeking into the lodge.%K%P

0xA1C
It seems that Okuhiko is still in deep thought.%K%P

0xA28
He's walked up behind me, but...%K%P

0xA34
He's probably worried...%K%P

0xA40
If he doesn't take the pizza, then he'll stay hungry.%K%N

0xA4C
But if he does take the pizza, then he'll have to face%NSaki's wrath later.%K%P

0xA58
To Okuhiko, this might be a forked road.%K%P

0xA80
―This is bad!%K%P

0xA8C
My mind races.%K%P

0xA98
If Okuhiko doesn't take the pizza, then Saki will have lost%Nher reason to go to Lunabeach!%K%P

0xAA4
If that happens, then various things will need to happen%Nafterwards for history to correct its course.%K%P

0xAB0
If possible, I'd rather avoid any deviations...%K%P

0xAE8
Haruka「Hey...」%K%P

0xAFC
Haruka must have finished brushing her teeth, as she%Ncomes over.%K%P

0xB08
She tugs on Okuhiko's clothes.%K%P

0xB14
Haruka「Hey... Okuhiko... I'm hungry...」%K%P

0xB44
Okuhiko「Ah, thank you for all your trouble～」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xB64
Okuhiko「I'm Okuhiko Asakura.」%K%P

0xB78
For some reason, Okuhiko looks like he's about to cry.%K%N

0xB84
The rest of us feel relieved.%K%P

0xBF8
Okuhiko「Hey, shouldn't we go now?」%K%P

0xC04
As he rises, Okuhiko flicks his long bangs away from his%Nface.%K%P

0xC20
Yuka「Huh? Go where, Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0xC34
Okuhiko「Huh? Yuka-chan... e-er, look, didn't we make a promise on%Nthe night of March 31st? That we'd all go play tennis the%Nnext day.」%K%P

0xC40
He didn't say "yesterday", but "March 31st", like a time%Ntraveler.%K%P

0xC4C
That's because to Okuhiko, it probably doesn't feel like%N"March 31st" was yesterday. Well, it's the same for all of%Nus...%K%P

0xC58
However...%K%N

0xC64
I glare at Yuka.%K%P

0xC70
(Yuka, don't forget what you're supposed to say!)%K%P

0xC84
Yuka「... Ah! Yeah! Right, right... that's right... How careless of%Nme♪」%K%P

0xC98
Okuhiko「... H-Hang in there... Yuka-chan.」%K%P

0xCA4
For once, I agree with Okuhiko.%K%P

0xCC0
Yuka looks at me as if to say "sorry."%K%P

0xCCC
Fortunately, Okuhiko doesn't seem suspicious.%K%P

0xCE0
Yuka「Well then, everyone, please get ready!」%K%P

0xD30
... And so, we arrive at the tennis court.%K%P

0xD44
Yuka「All right then, let's play!」%K%P

0xD50
Yuka has rented four rackets from the court's manager,%Nand forced them into our hands.%K%P

0xD5C
It's almost blinding how much joy her eyes are radiating.%K%P

0xD68
Just then...%K%P

0xD84
Haruka「I'll... pass...」%K%P

0xD90
... She places the racket she had just received gently%Nagainst the bench.%K%P

0xDA4
Yuka「Whaaat?」%K%P

0xDC0
Okuhiko「Well then, Haruka-chan, shall we go to the ocean?」%K%P

0xDCC
At that moment, Okuhiko invites Haruka.%K%P

0xDD8
Okuhiko「Let's go. You want to go to the ocean, right?」%K%P

0xDE4
Well, if this is the same history, then Haruka should be%Nanxious to go to the ocean.%K%P

0xDF0
Okuhiko「I know where you want to go, Haruka-chan... Do you know%Nwhy?」%K%P

0xDFC
No way... is Okuhiko trying to turn the situation against%Nus...?%K%P

0xE08
This isn't good... I have no clue how we're going to be%Nable to keep deceiving him at this rate.%K%P

0xE14
Haruka「It's because...」%K%P

0xE20
Okuhiko「Huh? What's wrong?」%K%P

0xE3C
Haruka「I... want to go fishing.」%K%P

0xE50
Okuhiko「What?」%K%P

0xE78
Okuhiko is petrified.%K%P

0xE84
Heh... heh heh heh heh... That was wonderful, Haruka.%NYou're the best.%K%P

0xE90
Okuhiko「Wh-Why...?」%K%P

0xE9C
Haruka「Because fishing is more fun...」%K%P

0xEA8
Okuhiko「But... Haruka-chan... you've never fished before, right?」%K%P

0xEB4
Haruka「... Why do you know that?」%K%P

0xEC0
Okuhiko「Ah... no, um... Because I know everything you're thinking.」%K%P

0xECC
Haruka「Then... try to guess what I'm thinking now.」%K%P

0xEE0
Okuhiko「Sure, okay...」%K%P

0xEEC
Okuhiko「What you're thinking right now is: 'Okuhiko-kun can see%Nthrough everything about me♪ Amazing!' Right?」%K%P

0xEF8
Haruka「Wrong...」%K%P

0xF0C
Okuhiko「Huh?」%K%P

0xF18
Haruka「What I was thinking right now is... 'I absolutely don't want%NOkuhiko to follow me,'... That's what it was.」%K%P

0xF2C
Okuhiko「... WHA-!?」%K%P

0xF38
Ahahahaha! Serves you right, Okuhiko.%K%P

0xF44
He's so motionless and dumbstruck that it takes all of my%Nwillpower to keep myself from bursting into laughter.%K%P

0xF98
Yuka「Then we'll be right here.」%K%P

0xFA4
Yuka acts like she's consented, and shrugs.%K%P

0xFB8
Umm, let's see, this is where I...%K%P

0xFD4
Now that I think about it, I'm supposed to stay here and%Nplay tennis with Yuka...%K%P

0xFE0
It's probably for the best if I do so and act in%Naccordance with "history"...%K%P

0xFF4
Okuhiko「Well, see you later.」%K%P

0x1000
Okuhiko quickly recovers. As the heir of the world%Nfamous Iida Financial Group, it's to be expected. He's got%Nstrong, staunch nerves.%K%P

0x100C
Okuhiko「Well then, let's go, Haruka-ch...」%K%P

0x1018
... Haruka has already left, and is walking far away from%Nus.%K%P

0x102C
Okuhiko「W-Wait! Haruka-chan!!」%K%P

0x105C
Okuhiko frantically starts to chase after her.%K%P

0x1068
Okuhiko「I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO FISH!!!」%K%P

0x10D8
Now that I think about it, I went with Haruka to the ocean.%K%P

0x10E4
It's probably for the best if I do so to act in accordance%Nwith "history"... That's what I think.%K%P

0x10F0
Well, Haruka already said that she wants to go fishing, so%Nhistory's changed anyway, but...%K%P

0x10FC
Makoto「Hey, wait a minute, Yuka.」%K%P

0x1110
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x111C
Makoto「I never said I was going to play tennis.」%K%P

0x1128
Yuka「??」%K%P

0x1144
Okuhiko「H-Hey, Ishihara～!」%K%P

0x1150
After a swift recovery, Okuhiko immediately snaps at me.%NHe's sure got nerves of steel...%K%P

0x1164
Okuhiko「Ishihara can't be allowed to go!!」%K%P

0x1170
He shoots me a sharp glare and scowls.%K%P

0x117C
Geez... How pathetic...%K%P

0x1188
Makoto「I'm also... going fishing.」%K%P

0x119C
Yuka「Huuuh!?」%K%P

0x11B0
Okuhiko「Kuh... Dammit, why do you always have to get in my way?!」%K%P

0x11BC
A harsh expression rises on Okuhiko's face as he%Nbegins to whine.%K%P

0x11C8
Okuhiko「This time... this time, I won't let you two go together!」%K%P

0x11D4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x11E8
Yuka「H-Hey...」%K%P

0x1214
Okuhiko「Ishihara, there's no way in hell I'll let you go fishing with%NHaruka-chan... I won't let you!!」%K%P

0x1220
Okuhiko is desperately trying to change history.%K%P

0x1234
And just like that, he tries to grab me!%K%P

0x1240
... But I remain calm, and quietly speak.%K%P

0x124C
Makoto「Here's a prediction for you...%K You're the one who'll never%Nbe able to go... Okuhiko.」%K%P

0x1260
Okuhiko「What? ... Oh shit!」%K%P

0x126C
By the time Okuhiko realizes it, it's too late.%K%P

0x1294
A thick sound rings out.%K%P

0x12A0
Okuhiko「☆○◎×...!」%K%P

0x12F8
The racket smashes into the back of Okuhiko's head. He%Ncollapses to the ground in a daze.%K%P

0x1304
Yuka crouches down and shakes his body. He's%Nknocked out.%K%P

0x1310
However... this time, he has a nosebleed.%K He might have%Nhit his nose when he fell.%K%P

0x1324
Yuka「W-What should I do...」%K%P

0x1330
Though Yuka's words are familiar, there's a new%Nimplication behind them.%K%N

0x133C
That's because she hit him on purpose this time...%K%P

0x1360
Nevertheless... I think to myself.%K%N

0x136C
Okuhiko... he never learns, does he?%K%P

0x1394
Haruka and I decide to leave now, while Okuhiko's still%Nsprawled out on the ground.%K%P

0x13A0
As we leave, I talk to Yuka.%K%P

0x13AC
Makoto「Yuka, we're going to Princess Beach now...」%K%P

0x13C0
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x13CC
Makoto「I want to repeat history to a T as much as possible... If%Nwe can't, things might get too complicated.」%K%P

0x13D8
Yuka「... Yeah, I understand.」%K%P

0x13E4
That settled, I begin to chase after Haruka.%K%P
