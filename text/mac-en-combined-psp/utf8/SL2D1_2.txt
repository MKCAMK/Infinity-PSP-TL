No one's in the room yet.%K%P

0x58
Before long, the door to the living room slowly opens.%K%P

0x64
The one who comes in... is Haruka.%K%P

0x78
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x8C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x98
I try waiting several seconds for a response.%K%P

0xAC
But Haruka completely ignores me and quickly%Ndisappears into the kitchen, as if nothing had happened.%K%P

0xFC
I follow her and try to repeat myself.%K%P

0x108
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x114
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x13C
Without a word, she turns the sink faucet, filling her glass%Ncup with water.%K%P

0x148
With a tiny sound, she drinks the entire cup in one large%Ngulp.%K%P

0x160
Makoto「Umm, Haruka?」%K%P

0x16C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x178
Haruka doesn't answer.%K%P

0x184
She remains silent as she stares at the drops of water%Nfalling from the faucet.%K%P

0x1CC
... This is all exactly the same as the scene I once%Nexperienced.%K%P

0x1D8
(Which means... if what I'm thinking is correct, then...)%K%P

0x1EC
It's at this point that Okuhiko shows up, entering the%Nliving room while rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.%K%P

0x200
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x214
Okuhiko「Huh? I'm not... interrupting something, am I?」%K%P

0x220
He asks Haruka this as he ignores my presence.%K%P

0x234
Okuhiko「... Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x248
He glares at me as he laughs. His eyes are filled with%Nscorn...%K%P

0x254
(It's the same. Everything's exactly the same...)%K%P

0x260
(So I alone really did go back in time...)%K%P

0x26C
(If that's the case... then Saki's still alive...?)%K%P

0x278
(No, wait. It's too early to be jumping to conclusions,%Nright?)%K%P

0x284
(... All right. I'll try to confirm if today really is the 1st...)%K%P

0x3B0
With that thought in my mind, I try my best to let this day%Ngo by as I remember it.%K%P

0x3BC
Yuka's terrible breakfast.%K%N

0x3C8
My conversation with Kurumi, who accidentally delivered%Nthe pizza to us instead of Saki.%K%N

0x3D4
Going to the tennis court in the afternoon...%K%P

0x3E0
The whole time, I continue to think only of Saki.%K%P

0x3EC
For the time being, I have no choice but to fret about her.%K%P

0x3F8
But I can't make any careless actions.%K%P

0x404
If I take selfish actions, history might change.%K%P

0x410
I wouldn't like it if that resulted in us not meeting Saki.%K%P

0x41C
Before long, the sunset arrives...%K%N

0x448
... We finally arrive at Lunabeach.%K%N

0x454
We're also able to meet Izumi-san again.%K%P

0x460
All that's left is...%K%P

0x498
Saki「My name is 'Asakura'. Is the manager here?」%K%P

0x4CC
I turn around in surprise, and unintentionally cry.%K%P

0x4D8
It's Saki... She's alive right now, before my eyes...%K%P

0x4E4
Izumi「Yes... That would be me...」%K%P

0x508
Saki「What's the meaning of this!?」%K%P

0x514
Yep, that's Saki...%K%N

0x520
That voice... is definitely Saki's...%K%P

0x52C
Saki「Excuse me. My name is Saki Asakura. I'm from the Asakura%Nsummer house.」%K%P

0x538
Izumi「So that's it... Thank you for your continued patronage...」%K%P

0x544
Saki「It's not like I always use this place... Where's the pizza%Nthat I ordered?」%K%P

0x550
Izumi「Huh? What are you talking about?」%K%P

0x55C
Saki「My P-I-Z-Z-A! How many hours do you think I've been%Nwaiting for it!?」%K%P

0x568
Izumi「How many?」%K%P

0x574
Saki「Six hours, six goddamn hours! Just what kind of shop%Nare you running here!?」%K%P

0x580
Okuhiko「Seems there's people out there with quite the free time%Non their hands.」%K%P

0x58C
Saki「I wasn't talking to you people.」%K%P

0x598
Okuhiko「I wasn't talking to you either.」%K%P

0x5A4
Saki「Don't talk until I say so! Got it!?」%K%P

0x5B0
For some reason, I become happy.%K%N

0x5BC
That's just like Saki... this is definitely Saki!%K%P

0x5C8
Saki「The hell's up with you? You've been staring at me this%Nwhole time with this strange grin... Stop doing things that%Nare making me sick!」%K%P

0x5D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5E8
―Should I tell her the whole truth?%K%P

0x5F4
No, even if I do that, it'll probably be useless.%K%P

0x600
There's absolutely no doubt that she wouldn't trust me.%K%P

0x60C
It's better if we're just close acquaintances.%K%P

0x618
To Saki, I'm just...%K%N

0x624
nothing more than a complete stranger.%K%P

0x630
Anyway, Saki's all right. That alone is enough.%K%P

0x644
Izumi「So, what did you do for those six hours?」%K%P

0x658
Saki「I waited, of course!」%K%P

0x66C
Izumi「For six straight hours?」%K%P

0x688
Saki「Hell no! Even I don't have that kind of time!」%K%P

0x694
Saki「Even I, umm... umm... told it that. Yes. I told it to make do with%Njust what was there.」%K%P

0x6A0
Saki「But it fully knew that I had ordered a pizza, even though%Nit doesn't understand my language. So I didn't have any%Nother choice but to play around and wait!」%K%P

0x6AC
I see... Saki's talking about that puppy...%K%P

0x6C8
Izumi「I see.」%K%P

0x6DC
Kurumi「Onee-chan, you understand what she's saying?」%K%P

0x6F0
Izumi「It's fine, it's fine. In times like this, all you have to do is%N'that'.」%K%P

0x6FC
Kurumi「Huh? What do you mean?」%K%P

0x710
Izumi「It can't be helped, so let's just hear her out for now.」%K%P

0x71C
Izumi「These types just want to talk, then they go back home.%NUntil then, just endure it... Okay?」%K%P

0x730
Kurumi「But why do we have to put up with it?」%K%P

0x73C
Izumi「Because there was a mistake in her delivery, so...」%K%P

0x750
Kurumi「What!? Kurumi definitely delivered it!」%K%P

0x764
Izumi「Don't shout. If you didn't make a mistake, then why did it%Nend up like this?」%K%P

0x778
Kurumi「You're terrible! Onee-chan, you're doubting Kurumi!」%K%P

0x78C
Izumi「But she said it never arrived...」%K%P

0x798
Kurumi「It did too! Kurumi... delivered it to an 'Asakura-san'!」%K%P

0x7B4
Saki「Don't talk until I say so!」%K%P

0x7D0
Kurumi「Kurumi did deliver it to 'Asakura-san'!」%K%P

0x7EC
Saki「Just what the hell does that mean!?」%K%P

0x7F8
Hearing this exchange again makes me a little%Nsentimental.%K%P

0x804
It's very nostalgic...%K%P

0x810
(Yeah, and this is the part where Yuka remembers Saki...)%K%P

0x82C
Yuka「Saki... Could it be that you're THAT Saki Asakura?」%K%P

0x838
Just as I thought...%K%P

0x84C
I feel conviction welling up within me as I watch Saki and%NYuka's reunion unfold.%K%P

0x858
Time is certainly repeating itself. There's no doubt about%Nit.%K%P

0x864
But why...?%K%P

0x870
No, more importantly... April 6th is in five days.%K%N

0x87C
Saki will jump from the tip of the cape at Viewpoint Park...%K%P

0x888
When I think that, Izumi-san forces her way through Yuka%Nand Saki.%K%P

0x89C
Izumi「Well then, I'll treat you to dinner tonight. It'll be a%Ncelebration for your reunion!」%K%P

0x8B0
Yuka「Huh? No way, that's too much.」%K%P

0x8CC
Saki「Wait a second. I came here to clear up the issue about%Nmy pizza.」%K%P

0x8D8
Izumi「Then you can also consider this my apology...」%K%P

0x8EC
... And so, things begin to develop the same way they did%Nlast time.%K%P

0x8F8
This gets me thinking.%K%P

0x904
(Perhaps this might be a chance granted to me by God.)%K%P

0x910
(God is commanding me to save Saki this time...)%K%P

0x91C
(If things go on this way, then in five days, the same%Ntragedy will occur.)%K%P

0x928
(Is God lending me his power to attempt to prevent it... ?)%K%P

0x934
All right... I'll give it all I've got!%K%P

0x940
For Saki's sake...%K%P

0x94C
I'll do my best to take care of her and get through these%Nsix days!%K%P

0x960
Izumi「Will you all eat with them too?」%K%P

0x96C
Makoto「With pleasure♪」%K%P

0x978
I immediately answer.%K%P

0x984
It feels like I'm plunging right into fate.%K%P

0x9BC
... After that, we went shopping for rice, and ate%NIzumi-san's dinner.%K%P

0x9C8
After dinner, we snuck into the pool, and fled from the%Nyelling security guard once again...%K%P

0x9D4
It felt like I was watching a video recording of everything.%K%P

0x9E0
But there is one difference...%K%P

0x9EC
Late at night, I didn't pick up the bell on Moon Beach on%Nour way back to the lodge.%K%P

0x9F8
No, to be precise, I couldn't pick it up.%K%P

0xA04
The bell wasn't lying on the shore.%K%P

0xA10
I looked for it as hard as I could, but it was nowhere to%Nbe found.%K%P

0xA1C
(It's possible that because I have my memories, history%Nmight have changed a little bit.)%K%P

0xA28
Besides, I don't think it matters that much.%K%P

0xA34
It's not like the bell was the direct cause of that%Ntragedy, after all.%K%P

0xA40
If I continue to trust Saki, then that history will never%Nrepeat.%K%P

0xA4C
The bell isn't a problem.%K%P

0xA58
... As I think that way, I return to the lodge, and fall%Nasleep...%K%P
