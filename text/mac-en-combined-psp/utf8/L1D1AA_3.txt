??「Hey!」%K%P

0x68
He says that in such a gaudy voice that it causes me to%Nshiver repulsively.%K%N

0x74
It resembles the greeting of a dictator looking down on%Nhis people.%K%P

0x80
He looks at me as I stand still in the center of the room,%Nthen turns his attention towards the silent girl.%K%P

0x94
??「Huh? I'm not... interrupting something, am I?」%K%P

0xA8
He asks the girl this as he ignores my presence.%K%N

0xB4
Of course, she doesn't answer him.%K%P

0xC8
??「Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0xDC
While laughing, he glares at me again.%K%N

0xE8
His eyes are full with scorn...%K%P

0xF4
(Does he have something against me...?)%K%P

0x108
He lets out a loud yawn while slowly walking over to the%Nsofa before sitting on it.%K%N

0x114
He keeps about 50 cm between the girl and himself.%K%P

0x120
50 cm... That's pretty incredible.%K%N

0x12C
It's a distance that's not too far to be distant, but not%Ntoo close to be considered creepy.%K%P

0x138
He did it so effortlessly that it must be like second%Nnature to him, a process that's been imprinted and%Nstored in his brain, such as unconsciously controlling a%Ncar or bike would be.%K%P

0x144
I suppose this is what you call a "master".%K%P

0x150
... This guy is the only one whose name I'd heard before%Ncoming here.%K%P

0x15C
"Okuhiko Iida."%K%N

0x168
If you were a student at my college, you would have%Nheard his name at least once.%K%P

0x174
I bet that even if you asked somebody off-campus,%Nthey'd have heard of him, the 'Son of the Iida Financial%NGroup'.%K%P

0x180
In any case, the upper class Iida family live lives that us%Nworking class people can only dream about. As Okuhiko%Nis the family's heir, it has been arranged for him to%Nbecome the head of it someday.%K%P

0x18C
In school, you couldn't go a day without hearing gossip%Nabout him.%K%P

0x198
"He always keeps millions of yen in the trunk of his%Nbeloved Ferraro," or...%K%P

0x1A4
"I heard that he conducted business with a celebrity,%Nand then..." Most of the stories are basically...%K%P

0x1B0
"Two years ago, that happened to him, but when he gave%Nthat and did that..." ... Vague, outlandish stuff like that.%K%P

0x1BC
And last night, I first met the infamous "Okuhiko" in%Nperson.%K

0x5E0
Recall last night's events.

0x5EC
Talk to Okuhiko.

0x258
—Sunday, March 31st.%K%N

0x264
When I arrived here, it was a little past 10:00 at night.%K%P

0x270
The exterior of the lodge was illuminated by moonlight.%NMy imagination ran wild as I was awed by its beauty and%Nhow much bigger it was than what I thought it would be.%K%P

0x27C
When I heard of a "college-run lodge", I just assumed%Nthat it'd be painfully cramped and extremely dirty, like a%Nreally cheap, rundown motel. Clearly, I was wrong.%K%P

0x288
There's no way the college would own such luxurious%Nproperty for just this camp.%K%N

0x294
Maybe it's a vacation spot for the college's staff.%K%P

0x2A0
... That's what I was thinking as I opened the front door.%K%P

0x2D0
The room was filled with a mysterious atmosphere that%Nseemed uncharacteristic.%K%P

0x2DC
—A lone girl was sitting on the floor, clutching her%Nknees.%K%P

0x2E8
—I saw another sitting at the dining table, spacing out%Nwhile resting her chin in her hands.%K%P

0x2F4
—A man was reclining on the sofa, swirling a wine glass%Nin his hand.%K%P

0x300
No one spoke to each other; I don't even think there was%Nany conversation to begin with.%K%P

0x30C
It was completely silent...%K%N

0x318
No, I could occasionally hear the faint sound of the man%Ngulping down his wine, but that was it.%K%P

0x324
Before long, the girl from the round table noticed me...%K%P

0x338
??「Ah, glad you could make it〜」%K%P

0x344
... Is what she said.%K%P

0x350
From the way she said that, it seemed like she was much%Nmore tired than me.%K%P

0x35C
??「Um, you're Makoto-kun... that is, 'Makoto Ishihara'... right?」%K%P

0x368
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x37C
??「It's nice to meet you♪」%K%P

0x388
Yuka「I'm Yuka... 'Yuka Kawashima'. I really don't know why, but%Nbefore I knew it, I became the 'leader' of this group.」%K%P

0x39C
Yuka「I mean, it's not like I have particularly good grades, and%Nmy behavior's not exactly the best. I guess they must%Nhave just randomly decided by lottery or something like%Nthat.」%K%P

0x3B0
Yuka「Well, anyway, I'm pleased to meet you!」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「Yeah... same here.」%K%P

0x3D0
After saying this, I glanced at the other two in the room.%K%P

0x3DC
The girl clutching her knees stared at the floor without%Neven moving.%K%N

0x3E8
She looked as if she were a piece of art made of plaster%Nthat had been previously placed in here.%K%P

0x3F4
The man casually held his wine glass up towards the%Nlamp light to check out the wine's color.%K%N

0x400
As he was doing this, he began to speak.%K%P

0x414
Okuhiko「Name's Okuhiko Iida... I'm guessing you've heard of me%Nbefore?」%K%P

0x420
Makoto「Huh? You can't be... the heir of the Iida Financial Group?」%K%P

0x434
Okuhiko「I don't really like that tone of yours...」%K%P

0x440
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x454
Okuhiko「Well, whatever. Yes, I am that 'Okuhiko Iida'. Nice to meet%Nyou.」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「... Nice to... meet you too...」%K%P

0x46C
I was so startled that I messed up my greeting. I couldn't%Nhelp it, though.%K%P

0x478
"Okuhiko Iida"—I couldn't believe the infamous%N"Okuhiko" was in the same group as me!%K%P

0x484
Suddenly, I began to contemplate whether or not to fake%Nan illness so I could go home.%K%N

0x490
I was beginning to feel depressed.%K%P

0x4A4
... After that, we barely exchanged a single word, and%Nwent to our beds.%K%N

0x4B0
In the end, the girl clutching her knees never said a%Nsingle word.%K%P
