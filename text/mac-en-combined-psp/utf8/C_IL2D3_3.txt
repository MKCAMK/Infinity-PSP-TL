Haruka「Welcome back...」%K%P

0x98
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA4
Haruka「What's wrong...?」%K%P

0xB0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBC
Haruka「It hasn't even been... two hours yet.」%K%P

0xC8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xDC
Haruka「Ah...」%K%P

0xE8
In that instant, something tugs on Haruka's fishing rod.%K%P

0xFC
Haruka slowly but steadily winds the reel...%K%P

0x108
Her cheeks bathed by the setting sun glitter radiantly,%Nand an innocent smile rises to her face.%K%P

0x114
Yuka, Kurumi, and Haruka... They seem to be enjoying the%NSeminar Camp more than they were last time.%K%P

0x120
The world continues to move on without change today%Nas well.%K%P

0x12C
I'm the only one who's continuously anxious...%K%P

0x138
(I can't go on like this!)%K%P

0x144
On the other hand, although I think this, my mind is filled%Nwith melancholy due to the many mysteries that I still%Ncan't explain.%K%P

0x150
(It's best... not to know the future...)%K%P

0x15C
(It's way happier to be like I was in the past, where I didn't%Nthink about anything and just leisurely passed the time.)%K%P

0x168
But there's nothing that can be done about it.%K%P

0x174
The only thing I can do now is think.%K%P

0x180
Even though I can go back to the past...%K%N

0x18C
I can't go back... to who I was...%K%P

0x208
The western sky begins to turn red.%K%P

0x214
Time begins to pass away moment after moment.%K%P

0x220
Haruka hangs her fishing rod down while checking the%Ncolor of the moving clouds.%K%P

0x234
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0x240
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x24C
Haruka「Have you ever kissed someone?」%K%P

0x260
The world continues to move on without change today%Nas well.%K%P

0x26C
I've been left behind, loitering around at my wits' end.%K%P

0x278
Haruka's bangs sway in the sea breeze...%K%P

0x2BC
... ... ...%K%P

0x360
After that...%K%N

0x36C
Haruka and I return to the lodge.%K%N

0x378
Okuhiko was out on the terrace, shouting something to%Nhimself.%K%N

0x384
Unfortunately, I don't really remember what he said.%K%N%N

0x390
Before long, Saki came over, but she calmly and silently%Npassed by, as if nothing was happening.%K%P

0x3A4
Naturally, the basket remained unscathed as well.%K%N

0x3B0
Since Saki didn't fall into the ocean, she doesn't have%Nany feelings for Okuhiko. Thus, she didn't get angry.%K%P

0x3C4
That also means that no one knows that Haruka is a%Nclone.%K%N

0x3D0
I'm doubtful whether or not Saki even knew that.%K%N

0x3DC
They're so friendly to each other now that it's hard to%Nbelieve that they were fighting in the last history...%K%N

0x3E8
It seems that history is steadily proceeding in a good%Ndirection.%K%P

0x3FC
Despite that, my heart feels like it's sinking deeper and%Ndeeper into an abyss as time passes...%K%N%N

0x408
Will it continue to fall forever?%K%N

0x414
Or will it eventually climb back up?%K%P

0x428
At any rate, there's no doubt that the fated time is%Napproaching quickly.%K%N%N

0x434
The fated time... The moment where the truth will be%Nrevealed...%K%N%N

0x440
... ... ...%K%P

0x5D0
Kurumi「Wow～～♪ There's a lot of crabs here～♪」%K%P

0x5DC
―We're by the rocky area at Princess Beach.%K%P

0x5E8
Kurumi's shrill voice rings out as she peeks into the tide%Npool.%K%P

0x5F4
Kurumi「Hey, hey, do you think this is a school for crabs?」%K%P

0x600
Makoto「Hmm... Rather than a school... I'd call it a stable.」%K%P

0x60C
Kurumi「A stable? What do you mean, stable?」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「Isn't that obvious? ―It's a sumo stable!」%K%P

0x624
Kurumi「Oh ho～... Which means the smallest one is the stable%Nmaster?」%K%P

0x630
Makoto「... Why's that?」%K%P

0x63C
Kurumi「Because usually, the active sumo wrestler is bigger%Nthan the stable master, right?」%K%P

0x648
Makoto「Oh, I see.」%K%P

0x654
Kurumi「Yay♪ Crabs...」%K%P

0x660
Kurumi「Crabs～～♪」%K%P

0x66C
As she shouts in joy, Kurumi picks out and takes the%N"stable manager".%K%P

0x678
Kurumi「Hey, Mr. Crab. Wanna play Rock-Paper-Scissors with%NKurumi?」%K%P

0x684
Kurumi「Ready, set, Rock, Paper, Scissors... Rock!」%K%P

0x690
Kurumi「Yay, Kurumi won♪」%K%P

0x69C
Kurumi dances in joy on top of the rocks.%K%P

0x6A8
Her innocent smile...%K%P

0x6B4
These unchanging days...%K%P

0x6C0
The world continues to go on...%K%P

0x6D4
Suddenly, I look up at the sky.%K%P

0x6E0
I see a black kite flying in the air, circling around.%K%P

0x6EC
It continues to turn around and around, without getting%Ntired of flapping.%K%P

0x6F8
Just then...%K%P

0x714
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x720
... I tear my gaze from the sky and return it to Kurumi.%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「Hmm? What's wrong?」%K%P

0x738
Kurumi「No... it's nothing.」%K%P

0x744
Kurumi「Kurumi just picked up something a little interesting...」%K%P

0x750
Makoto「... Something... interesting?」%K%P

0x75C
(Something... interesting...?)%K%P

0x770
Izumi「Oh... this?」%K%P

0x77C
Izumi「Kurumi gave this to me.」%K%P

0x788
Izumi「It was the night of the 4th. Kurumi said she 'picked it up%Non Princess Beach'...」%K%P

0x79C
Which means that's...%K%P

0x7A8
―The bell!?%K%P

0x7B4
On the last 4th, Kurumi picked up the bell on Princess%NBeach, and gave it to Izumi-san.%K%P

0x7C0
If the same history repeats itself, then...%K%P

0x7CC
Makoto「H-Hey, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x7D8
Makoto「Can I... have a look at it?」%K%P

0x808
Kurumi「All right... If you beat Kurumi at Rock-Paper-Scissors♪」%K%P

0x814
Makoto「R-Rock-Paper-Scissors!?」%K%P

0x820
Makoto「Now's not the time for-」%K%P

0x82C
Kurumi「It's fine, it's fine!」%K%P

0x840
Kurumi「Then let's go～♪ Ready, set...」%K%P

0x84C
―Just then, the gears in my mind start to whirl ultra%Nfast.%K%P

0x858
(Last time, Kurumi used... Scissors.)%K%P

0x864
(Yes, that's right! Kurumi extended the crab she was%Nholding...)%K%P

0x870
(If that's the case, then she'll probably do the same%Nthing now!)%K%P

0x884
Kurumi「Rock, Paper, Scissors... Go!」%K%P

0x890
When she shouts this, I stick out my firmly clenched fist!%K%P

0x89C
Naturally, Kurumi has stuck out the "crab".%K%P

0x8B0
Kurumi「Uwaa, Kurumi lost～」%K%P

0x8C4
Kurumi「Hey! Sumo Crab! This is your fault, isn't it?」%K%P

0x8D0
Kurumi「We lost because you used scissors!」%K%P

0x8DC
The stable manager says nothing, white foam coming%Nfrom its mouth.%K%P

0x8F0
Kurumi「Geez, it can't be helped～」%K%P

0x904
Kurumi「Then as promised, Kurumi will show you.」%K%P

0x910
As she says this, Kurumi quickly extends her left hand,%Nand opens her palm.%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x928
There's nothing there.%K%P

0x934
In Kurumi's palm is just seawater and countless grains of%Nsand, and... nothing else.%K%P

0x940
Makoto「Hey, Kurumi! Quit lording it over me. Hurry up and show me.」%K%P

0x954
Kurumi「Huh? But Kurumi is showing you, right?」%K%P

0x960
Makoto「No you're not! Geez, don't joke around with adults!」%K%P

0x974
Kurumi「Kurumi's not joking around!」%K%P

0x980
Kurumi「Just take a closer look!」%K%P

0x98C
Makoto「... Closer?」%K%P

0x9A0
Kurumi「Yeah...」%K%P

0x9AC
Kurumi thrusts her palm right in front of my eyes while%Nnodding.%K%P

0x9B8
I firmly stare at her palm...%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「What the hell!? There really is nothing there!」%K%P

0x9D8
Kurumi「There is!」%K%P

0x9E4
Kurumi「See, it's here, here!」%K%P

0x9F0
Using the crab's toes, Kurumi points to the center of her%Nhand.%K%P

0x9FC
Looking closely, there certainly is something...%K%P

0xA10
Kurumi「Well? It's there, isn't it?」%K%P

0xA1C
Kurumi「―It's a star sand♪」%K%P

0xA28
... It's a jagged, pointy small grain.%K%P

0xA34
It's not the bell, but a star sand...%K%P

0xA40
The star in her palm sparkles brightly.%K%P

0xAC4
Kurumi「Ready! ... Go!」%K%P

0xAD8
Kurumi「Go, go!」%K%P

0xAE4
Kurumi「GOOOOO～～!」%K%P

0xAF8
Kurumi「Ring out! Sumo Crab wins～♪」%K%P

0xB04
Kurumi takes the winning crab (the "stable manager")%Nand the losing crab, and strokes them equally.%K%P

0xB10
A smile crosses her entire face...%K%P

0xB1C
―This is an unchanging reality.%K%N

0xB28
―And yet a dynamic one... what with the star sand.%K%P

0xB3C
Izumi「―Yes! ―It's nothing more than an event in your%Ndelusion, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0xB50
Suddenly, the words Izumi-san said last night cross my%Nmind...%K%P

0xB5C
(This scene is all just a delusion...?)%K%P

0xB68
(Kurumi's smile, the soft sunlight, and the roar of the%Nwaves breaking on the shore...)%K%P

0xB74
(You're saying that all this is an illusion invented by my%Nconsciousness...?)%K%P

0xB80
(...)%K%P

0xB8C
(Haah... what the hell am I thinking!?)%K%P

0xB98
(I'd have to be nuts to believe in such utter bullshit!)%K%P

0xBA4
Rather than be bothered with time travel and infinite%Nloops, I should be more focused on realistic things.%K%P

0xBB8
Kurumi「Hmm? What's wrong, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0xBC4
Kurumi「Your eyebrows and face are all scrunched up.」%K%P

0xBD0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBE4
Kurumi「Could it be... that you don't find the crab sumo%Ninteresting?」%K%P

0xBF0
Makoto「N-No, that's not it.」%K%P

0xBFC
Kurumi「Really?」%K%P

0xC08
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xC14
Kurumi「You don't have to be here if you don't want to.」%K%P

0xC20
Makoto「I'm telling you, it's really interesting!」%K%P

0xC2C
Makoto「It's so exciting that it feels like my skin's gonna melt with%Nhow hot my blood is boiling!」%K%P

0xC40
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0xC54
Kurumi「... Then it's fine♪」%K%P

0xC60
Kurumi「Kurumi thought she was the only one having fun, so she%Nwas a little worried♪」%K%P

0xC6C
Kurumi's face lights up slightly.%K%P

0xC78
Makoto「Hey, Kurumi! While we've been talking... the crabs have%Nbeen running away. Is that what you want?」%K%P

0xC8C
Kurumi「Ah! Hey, wait up, Sumo Crab!」%K%P

0xCA0
Kurumi frantically stands up, and starts chasing after%Nthe crabs.%K%P

0xCBC
But one second later...%K%P

0xCE4
Kurumi trips, and falls straight into the ground.%K%P

0xCF0
A cloud of sand soars up... She holds out her hands and%Narches her back like a shrimp... and her face is buried in%Nthe sand.%K%P

0xCFC
Makoto「Wh-What are you doing, Kurumi!?」%K%P

0xD08
I run over to Kurumi's side, and help her up.%K%P

0xD14
Kurumi looks at me, her face covered in sand.%K%P

0xD20
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0xD34
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xD40
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD54
Kurumi「... Eheh♪」%K%P

0xD60
Kurumi「Kurumi was crouching all this time, so her legs fell%Nasleep～♪」%K%P

0xD6C
An embarrassed smile rises to Kurumi's face.%K%P

0xD78
Grains of sand fall off her face like rain drops.%K%P

0xD84
―This is an unchanging reality.%K%N

0xD90
―And yet a dynamic one... what with that sand%Ncovered face.%K%P

0xD9C
I think that this is all right.%K%P

0xDA8
"What's more important than whether it's true or not is%Nwhether you can believe it or not."%K%P

0xDB4
(In short... that's how it is...)%K%P

0xDC0
Kurumi shuts her eyes tightly, and wipes the sand off%Nher face with her palm.%K%P

0xDCC
However, her hands are wet, so now a lot of sand is%Nstuck to her palm.%K%P

0xDD8
As a matter of course, the more she tries to wipe off, the%Ndirtier her face gets.%K%P

0xDE4
Makoto「Haah... geez...」%K%P

0xDF0
While muttering this, I use the back of my index finger to%Nwipe Kurumi's face.%K%P

0xE04
Kurumi「Teheheheh...♪」%K%P

0xE10
Kurumi bashfully sticks out her tongue.%K%P

0xE1C
Before I realize it, a smile has risen to my face.%K%P

0xE54
... ... ...%K%P
