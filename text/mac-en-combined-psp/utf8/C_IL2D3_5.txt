Izumi-san takes a deep breath, and sighs.%K%P

0x60
She carefully straightens out her skirt again, and%Nplaces her fingers on her knees.%K%P

0x6C
―Schr▼dinger's cat.%K%N

0x78
"The observer's intention decides the truth of the past."%K%P

0x84
―The Third Trait of Cur▲ Syndrome.%K%N

0x90
"A firm thought creates a new reality."%K%P

0x9C
I see, those two certainly do share some common points.%K%P

0xA8
Anyway, someone's imagination has already changed%Nreality.%K%P

0xB4
When the observer thinks "Let's open the lid", he is%Nconfirming the life or death status between the%Ncoexisting states the cat is in...%K%P

0xC0
Tom felt "I want to heal her illness", and that caused the%Nfocus of her illness to disappear.%K%P

0xCC
Now then... back to the real issue at hand.%K%P

0xD8
Just how can you say this is related to the infinite loop?%K%P

0xE4
"Someone's imagination can change reality."%K%P

0xF0
If that's the case, then is it really... related to the%Nphenomenon of time travel...?%K%P

0x104
Izumi「The experiment...」%K%P

0x110
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x11C
Izumi「The experiment for Cur▲ Syndrome...」%K%P

0x128
Izumi「Its true goal also was actually an investigation on The%NThird Trait.」%K%P

0x134
Izumi「To lie to you, Makoto-kun... to make you embrace your%Ndelusions... and see if those delusions would actually%Nbecome reality or not... that's what I planned to%Ninvestigate.」%K%P

0x140
Izumi「Of course, at first, I was dubious about The Third Trait...」%K%P

0x14C
Izumi「As a scholar, I couldn't believe this idiotic phenomenon.」%K%P

0x158
Izumi「That's why this experiment was conducted; in order to%Ndiscover another explanation for The Third Trait.」%K%P

0x164
Makoto「In short, it was something to deny The Third Trait―a%Ncounter-proof experiment, right?」%K%P

0x170
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x184
Izumi「But you know what? Against my expectations... it seems%Nthe experiment has succeeded...」%K%P

0x1AC
Izumi「The Third Trait... was proven...」%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「What!? W-Wait a minute, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x1C4
Makoto「Just what... does that mean!?」%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「Didn't you say earlier that 'We didn't conduct the%Nexperiment once'?」%K%P

0x1DC
Makoto「It can't be... are you lying to me again?」%K%P

0x1F0
Izumi「No, that's not it. What I said was certainly the truth.」%K%P

0x1FC
Izumi「So far, I haven't deceived you once, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x208
Makoto「What? What you're saying isn't making any sense!」%K%P

0x214
Makoto「Then what did you mean by 'The experiment succeeded'?」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「'The Third Trait was proven'... Why do you say that?」%K%P

0x234
Izumi「Because of this reality that exists right now, before our%Neyes.」%K%P

0x240
Izumi「The fact that we are experiencing this strange reality in%Nthis way.」%K%P

0x24C
Izumi「And above all, there's proof...」%K%P

0x258
Izumi「The time travel, the infinite loop, the premonitions, and%Nthe memories...」%K%P

0x26C
Izumi「―All of these prove The Third Trait's accuracy!」%K%P

0x278
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x284
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x290
Makoto「AHHHHHHH, I don't get ittttttttttttt!」%K%P

0x29C
Makoto「I don't get a single word of what you're saying!」%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「After all... think about it carefully.」%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「The rice, the earthquake, the battery, the dinner, and the%Ncards...」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「Even though no one deceived me, I was correct about all%Nof them!」%K%P

0x2CC
Makoto「In other words, this 'experiment' of yours is completely%Nunrelated to the occurrence of the phenomenon known%Nas 'premonitions!'」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「No matter how I think about it, it's illogical to consider that%Nthese chains of phenomena are related to the%Nexperiment!」%K%P

0x2EC
Izumi「No...」%K%P

0x2F8
Izumi「It's not strange at all...」%K%P

0x304
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x310
Izumi「I think this is how it went down.」%K%P

0x348
Izumi「At the start, before you were caught up in this infinite%Nloop, during the very first series of six days that you%Nexperienced...」%K%P

0x354
Izumi「You weren't able to have 'premonitions' at all.」%K%P

0x360
Izumi「At that time, you still knew nothing... Not about the rice or%Nthe earthquake.」%K%P

0x36C
Izumi「And then, I think the past me in that time... commenced the%Nexperiment, just as planned.」%K%P

0x378
Izumi「In some manner, I probably made you firmly believe that it%Nwas as though you had precognition.」%K%P

0x384
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x390
Izumi「Before long, the symptoms of Cur▲ Syndrome began to%Nmanifest within your consciousness.」%K%P

0x39C
Izumi「In other words, you started to embrace a certain%Ndelusion.」%K%P

0x3A8
Izumi「However, the subject of your delusion was slightly%Ndifferent from what I had planned.」%K%P

0x3B4
Izumi「You didn't think 'I have the power to receive%Npremonitions'... You started to think 'Have I time traveled?'」%K%P

0x3C0
"I can have premonitions because I've experienced the%Nfuture once."%K%P

0x3CC
Izumi「... You were convinced in that manner.」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3E4
Izumi「If the experiment went as planned, then it should have%Nended without incident.」%K%P

0x3F0
Izumi「At midnight on April 7th... If I had revealed everything to%Nyou, your delusion should have disappeared without a%Ntrace.」%K%P

0x3FC
Makoto「But... that's not what happened...」%K%P

0x408
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x414
Izumi「Just before that, the worst possible situation occurred...」%K%P

0x458
Izumi「... Because...」%K%P

0x46C
Izumi「... I died...」%K%P

0x478
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x49C
Izumi「I think that the Makoto-kun who was faced with that%Nscene surely thought this.」%K%P

0x4A8
"I want to go back to the past. I want to go back to the%Npast and change history."%K%P

0x4B4
"And I have a miraculous ability that will enable me to do%Nthat."%K%P

0x4C0
Izumi「That strong thought warped the 'reality' within you.」%K%P

0x4CC
Izumi「Your delusion produced a new reality.」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「And so I returned to the past...?」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「That was the first time I 'really' time traveled...」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「It was arranged that the me who had already%Nexperienced the future had 'real' premonitions...」%K%P

0x530
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x53C
Makoto「No, wait.」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「Then how do you explain my memories?」%K%P

0x554
Makoto「Even though I only had vague memories in the earlier%Nhistories, right now, I have complete memories that I can%Neasily remember..」%K%P

0x560
Izumi「... Right... I was thinking the same thing as you, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x56C
Izumi「In the first place, those which are called memories are%Nsomething stored in the brain, right?」%K%P

0x578
Izumi「If that's the case, then it means that our current brains%Nare the same as the ones we had right before we time%Ntraveled.」%K%P

0x584
Izumi「However, there's only one of you and me in this time%Nperiod.」%K%P

0x590
Izumi「That means we didn't travel back in time with our%Nrespective bodies.」%K%P

0x59C
Makoto「So then... where did these memories come from...?」%K%P

0x5A8
Izumi「The answer to that... has already appeared.」%K%P

0x5B4
Izumi「It's not that these memories came from somewhere.」%K%P

0x5C0
Izumi「Our brains are remaining at that time on April 6th.」%K%P

0x5D4
Izumi「In other words, we...」%K%P

0x5E0
Izumi「―Never time traveled!」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「... Wh-What are you saying now-」%K%P

0x600
Izumi「Hey? Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x60C
Izumi「Perhaps this reality... might be an event in someone's%Ndelusion.」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「In a delusion?」%K%P

0x624
Izumi「To you, it's a delusion that sprouted within you... To me,%Nit's a delusion that spouted within me...」%K%P

0x630
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x63C
Izumi「All right? I never said earlier that 'Makoto-kun went back%Nto the past', did I?」%K%P

0x648
Izumi「I only said that your strong desire to go back to the%Npast 'warped' the reality within you... Isn't that right?」%K%P

0x654
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x660
Izumi「Makoto-kun, when you witnessed the scene of my death,%Nyou strongly wished 'I want to go back to the past'.」%K%P

0x66C
Izumi「But I wonder if it instead, that thought of yours made you%N'reminisce in a delusional way' about an ideal past,%Nrather than taking your consciousness 'back to the%Npast'.」%K%P

0x678
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x684
Izumi「'The observer's intention decides the facts of the past.'」%K%P

0x690
Izumi「What if we assume a phenomenon like Schr▼dinger's cat%Nroutinely happens in our daily lives...?」%K%P

0x69C
Izumi「'Someone's strong wish completely changes the facts%Nof the past'... Also consider that that isn't an impossible%Nstory.」%K%P

0x6A8
Izumi「In fact, Dr. Cabin has actually experienced a%Nphenomenon described as such...」%K%P

0x6B4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6C0
Izumi「But you know what?」%K%P

0x6CC
Izumi「It's doesn't mean something like 'You time travel into the%Npast and end up changing history'.」%K%P

0x6D8
Izumi「'You change the past the moment you have a delusion'...%NThat's what it means.」%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x6F0
Izumi「In short, the instant you witnessed the scene of my%Ndeath, you had the delusion of 'a different possibility%Nwhere it didn't turn out like this.'」%K%P

0x714
Izumi「No, to be more accurate...」%K%P

0x720
Izumi「You're 'having' the delusion of 'a different possibility%Nwhere it didn't turn out like this.'」%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「Then, right now... the reality I see before my eyes is...」%K%P

0x740
Izumi「―Yes! ―It's nothing more than an event in your%Ndelusion, Makoto-kun!」%K%P
