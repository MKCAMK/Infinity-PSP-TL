Before long, we finish cleaning up the barbecue and%Nhead back to the lodge...%K%P

0x68
Izumi-san, Kurumi, and of course, Saki, all come with us.%K%P

0x74
Just as we enter the living room, Izumi-san declares this.%K%P

0x88
Izumi「Oh, right. There's actually an open air hot spring nearby.」%K%P

0x9C
I can't hide the surprise I feel from those words.%K%P

0xA8
I've been on this island for eleven days, but I had no%Nclue there was a hot spring around here...%K%P

0xB4
It seems history certainly has changed after all.%K%P

0xC0
... And thus, we head for the open air hot spring.%K%P

0x168
The hot spring really is close to the lodge.%K%P

0x174
It's an isolated, natural hot spring surrounded by rocks,%Nlying in the middle of the forest...%K%P

0x180
... It's already been ten minutes since I went in.%K%P

0x18C
My body is completely boiling, and I'm really relaxed.%K%P

0x198
(I should get out for a moment...)%K%P

0x1A4
I let out a happy sigh as I sit up on the crag.%K%P

0x1B0
The gentle night's breeze feels great as it cools down%Nmy boiling upper body.%K%P

0x1BC
Makoto「Whew...」%K%P

0x1C8
This seriously feels amazing. I wonder when was the last%Ntime I've had a bath that felt this good.%K%P

0x1D4
Now that I think about it, we've done a lot of different%Nthings at this camp, but it's all felt so peaceful.%K%P

0x1E0
As I'm thinking about this, I naturally turn towards Saki.%K%P

0x1EC
... At that time, Saki stands up, and sits down next to me.%K%P

0x26C
Saki looks at me like she wants to say something.%K%P

0x278
I also try to think of something to say, but... I can see her%Ncleavage, and it's really distracting me.%K%P

0x284
I frantically look away, but I'm stumped as to where I%Nshould avert my eyes.%K%P

0x290
As I'm looking at the sky, then at my feet...%K%P

0x2A4
Saki「What's wrong?」%K%P

0x2B0
(Damn, did she notice...?)%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「N-Nothing really...」%K%P

0x2C8
I try give an answer that doesn't seem like I'm trying%Nsmooth things over.%K%P

0x2D4
But Saki's face is extremely calm.%K%P

0x2E8
Saki「So you really are a boy after all.」%K%P

0x304
In that instant, blood rushes to my head. As a man, that%Nwas an incredibly embarrassing moment.%K%P

0x310
Saki's quite perceptive. With no comeback, I decide to%Nsay an evasive comment so I can get out of this%Nhumiliating situation.%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「W-Well then... I'll go wash my head...」%K%P

0x328
I instantly stand up.%K%P

0x334
I want to get out of here as soon as possible.%K%P

0x340
Suddenly...%K%P

0x34C
—Whoosh.%K%P

0x358
Makoto「AAH!」%K%P

0x364
I slip on the wet crag, and lose my balance.%K%P

0x370
Desperately trying to stop my body from falling, I grab%Non to something soft and big before my eyes...%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x390
Saki「AAAH!!」%K%P

0x40C
I'm grabbing onto the now standing Saki's breasts with all%Nmy might.%K%P

0x418
I frantically let go of her...%K%P

0x424
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x430
Saki「...」%K%P

0x43C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x448
Saki「You did that... on purpose, didn't you?」%K%P

0x454
Makoto「Y-You're wrong! That wasn't inten-」%K%P

0x460
Saki「It seems like it was too much of a coincidence...」%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「I-I'm serious! It was an accident!」%K%P

0x478
Saki「Must've been quite the convenient accident...」%K%P

0x484
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x490
Saki「...」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4A8
Saki「Well, if you want to call it an accident, then go ahead.」%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「Like I said...」%K%P

0x4C0
My explanations are useless...%K%P

0x4CC
Might as well just quit while I'm ahead.%K%P

0x4D8
Besides...%K%P

0x560
... It doesn't seem like Saki's seriously mad.%K%P

0x56C
Normally, she probably would have slapped me by now.%K%P

0x578
She's probably a lot calmer now as a result of mending%Nher relationship with Haruka.%K%P

0x584
I think this is Saki's true personality.%K%P

0x5DC
As I think things like, "I got a little lucky," we decide to%Nleave the hot spring and head back to the lodge.%K%P

0x5F0
On the way back... As I'm walking through the forest, Saki%Nsuddenly comes running up to my side.%K%P

0x604
Makoto「Hmm? What's up, Saki?」%K%P

0x610
Saki「While I'm here, thank you... for this morning...」%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「... Thank you?」%K%P

0x628
Saki「...」%K%P

0x634
Makoto「Are you talking about the basket?」%K%P

0x640
Saki nods, her face red from embarrassment.%K%P

0x654
Saki「Well then, that means I've thanked you.」%K%P

0x668
Leaving with those words, Saki runs ahead of me...%K%P

0x674
I smile as I see her off.%K%P

0x688
("History repeats itself"... what a lie.)%K%P

0x694
As I throw myself down on my bed, I think that.%K%P

0x6A0
When I close my eyes, I fall into a deep, peaceful sleep...%K%P
