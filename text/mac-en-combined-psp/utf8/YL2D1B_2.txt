Yuka「No good... huh?」%K%P

0x6C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x78
I hang my head down in misery.%K%P

0x84
Yuka「I saw what happened...」%K%P

0x90
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9C
Yuka「Even though I tried to tell you to stop...」%K%P

0xA8
Makoto「You knew?」%K%P

0xB4
Yuka「Izumi-san said it before, didn't she? 'Because a storm's%Ncoming from the sea, the fishing boats can't go out'...」%K%P

0xC0
Yuka「'Because the migration velocity of the tropical cyclone%Nis slow, it'll be like this for about a week'... she also said%Nsomething like that.」%K%P

0xCC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD8
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0xE4
When she calls out to me, I lift my face.%K%P

0x114
Yuka「Don't get so down!」%K%P

0x120
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x12C
Yuka「Earlier, I said that this might be an infinite loop, didn't I?」%K%P

0x138
Yuka「One that would repeat countless times for all eternity...」%K%P

0x144
Yuka「But you know what? I think that it's probable that we took%Nthe exact same actions last time and the time before%Nthat.」%K%P

0x150
Yuka「In other words, the same events always played%Nthemselves out...」%K%P

0x15C
Yuka「Why did things happen that way... Makoto, do you know%Nwhy?」%K%P

0x168
I shake my head.%K%P

0x174
Yuka「Because our memories were vague!」%K%P

0x180
Yuka「At times, just before something happened, we would%Nexperience a 'premonition'... But in the end, they were%Nuseless...」%K%P

0x18C
Yuka「But this time is different.」%K%P

0x198
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x1A4
Yuka「We have reliable memories this time... right?」%K%P

0x1B0
Yuka「If that's the case, then even if we can't run away from%Nthis island, changing history will be easy!」%K%P

0x1BC
Makoto「Are you... for real?」%K%P

0x1D0
Yuka「Of course!」%K%P

0x1DC
Yuka「Actually, this morning, you subtly changed history, didn't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x1E8
Yuka「For example, because I didn't cook, you were still hungry.」%K%P

0x1F4
Yuka「Because you were hungry, you planned on stealing the%Npizza.」%K%P

0x200
Yuka「Then Okuhiko-kun's actions changed... and finally, it was%NHaruka who lied that her name was 'Asakura'...」%K%P

0x20C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x220
Yuka「Makoto, do you know what the butterfly effect is?」%K

0x558
Yeah.

0x564
No.

0x260
Makoto「... Yeah.」%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「It's the question of 'Does the flap of a butterfly's wings%Nin Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?', right?」%K%P

0x278
Makoto「In short, it means 'A tiny little microscopic change could%Naffect even an enormous phenomenon'.」%K%P

0x284
Makoto「It's kinda like the Japanese expression 'When the wind%Nblows, the barrel makers profit', isn't it?」%K%P

0x298
Makoto「...No.」%K%P

0x2A4
Yuka「'Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a%Ntornado in Texas?' ―That's the butterfly effect.」%K%P

0x2B0
Yuka「In short, it means 'A tiny little microscopic change could%Naffect even an enormous phenomenon'.'」%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「It's kinda like the Japanese expression 'When the wind%Nblows, the barrel makers profit', isn't it?」%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「This is a very old story... once, when the wind blew, dust%Nflew up into people's eyes, increasing the number of%Nblind people.」%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「Those blind people tried to make a living as shamisen%Nplayers, and as a result, the demand for catskin,%Nnecessary to make more shamisens, increased.」%K%P

0x2EC
Makoto「With less cats, the number of rats increased, and so%Nthey chewed on barrels, requiring more to be made.」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「... So in the end, the barrel makers profited...」%K%P

0x30C
Yuka「Yes! That's exactly it!」%K%P

0x318
Yuka「It's not like history is immune to the accumulation of small,%Nmicroscopic events, right?」%K%P

0x324
Yuka「So even if we just increase the number of small, trifling%Nchanges, it should be possible for reality to take a 180.」%K%P

0x330
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x33C
Yuka「History will definitely change!」%K%P

0x348
Yuka「No. WE will change history!」%K%P

0x354
Makoto「... This is our last chance...」%K%P

0x368
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x374
Makoto「If, by any chance, the same events occur on this April%N6th...」%K%P

0x380
Makoto「Then we might never be able to get another chance to%Nbreak out of this loop again.」%K%P

0x38C
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x398
Makoto「Isn't that right?」%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「When we wake up on the next morning of the 1st, there's%Nno guarantee that we'll have our memories, right!?」%K%P

0x3B0
Yuka「... Yeah... That certainly... might happen...」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「We'll change history―of course I agree with you%Nthere!」%K%P

0x3C8
Makoto「But... either way, if we act selfishly, then it'll all go to%Nnothing. Understand?」%K%P

0x3DC
Yuka「Yeah...」%K%P

0x3E8
Makoto「Even though we can repeat things, this is our last%Nchance!」%K%P

0x3F4
Makoto「So don't pull a stunt like you did last time...」%K%P

0x400
Makoto「Swear it right here, right now...」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「No matter what happens, never go near that shrine%Nagain...」%K%P

0x418
Yuka「... Got it... I swear it...」%K%P

0x424
Makoto「'Promises must definitely be kept'―That's what you%Nwrote in your letter.」%K%P

0x430
Makoto「Don't forget this vow... okay?」%K%P

0x454
Yuka gives me a serious stare, and nods.%K%P

0x460
And then, she opens her tightly shut mouth...%K%P

0x474
Yuka「Let's see it together.」%K%P

0x480
Yuka「Let's see the sunrise of April 7th... together.」%K%P

0x48C
... And mutters this.%K%P
