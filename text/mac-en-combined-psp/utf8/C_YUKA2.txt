Just as we promised yesterday, the six of us go to the%Npool.%K%P

0x18C
Kurumi stays behind this time too, due to her headache.%K%P

0x198
There isn't even a single cloud visible in the clear blue%Nsky.%K The gentle spring sunlight bathes us with its%Nwarming rays.%K The air contains a faint scent of seawater.%K%P

0x1A4
Everyone spends the time having fun, like last time.%K%P

0x1B0
But I...%K I'm... the only one feeling depressed.%K%P

0x1BC
Right now, I'm lying down on a deck chair while idly%Npassing the time.%K%P

0x1C8
My mind feels clear and my body's languid...%K%P

0x1D4
It's as if I'm in the middle of some kind of dream.%K%P

0x1E0
There's a group of kids playing innocently in the water...%K%P

0x1EC
It's nothing but a peaceful scene.%K%P

0x1F8
Yuka「Haah...」%K%P

0x204
...Even so, a sigh leaks from my mouth.%K%P

0x210
It feels like a heavy darkness has enveloped my heart.%K%P

0x21C
Could the irritation I felt yesterday still be bugging me...?%K%P

0x228
Or did I simply not get enough sleep...?%K%P

0x234
...%K%P

0x240
Or could it be both...?%K%P

0x24C
Well, either way, it doesn't change the fact that I'm feeling%Nmelancholic.%K%P

0x258
And so I clap my knees, and stand up.%K%P

0x264
At times like this, it's time for a change in pace.%K%P

0x270
For starters...%K%P

0x27C
(Time to get beer♪)%K%P

0x288
...I make a bee-line for the beverage stand.%K%P

0x294
Suddenly, I see someone performing a crawl at the%Nracing section of the pool.%K%P

0x2A0
...It's Makoto.%K%P

0x2AC
My gaze shifts from Makoto to his goal.%K%P

0x2B8
I impulsively decide to head over there instead of the%Nstand...%K%P

0x308
Makoto「FWAAH!」%K%P

0x314
Makoto reaches the end of the pool, and gasps for air%Nas he shoots his face out of the water.%K%P

0x320
I peer down on him from the high edge of the pool.%K%P

0x334
Yuka「Here.」%K%P

0x340
I bend over and hold out my right hand.%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「Oh, thank you.」%K%P

0x358
Makoto thanks me, takes my hand, and step onto the%Npoolside with one foot.%K%P

0x364
He puts his weight into his hand and looks about ready%Nto climb up.%K%P

0x370
Naturally, I intend to...%K

0x2F90
Pull him up.

0x2F9C
Let go of him midway.

0x3C0
At that time...%K%P

0x408
―Whoosh!%K%P

0x414
...In a completely unexpected turn of events, my arm is%Npulled back with great strength.%K%P

0x448
For an instant, it feels like Heaven and Earth have been%Nreversed. By the time I come to my senses, I've fallen%Ninto the pool at an awkward angle.%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「Gahahahahahahaha♪」%K%P

0x4D0
I raise my face out of the water to see Makoto, who is%Nnow on top of the poolside, laughing his ass off at me at%Nme.%K%P

0x4DC
I finally realize that what happened just now was%NMakoto's doing.%K%P

0x4E8
Yuka「Ba-Bagodo!」%K%P

0x4F4
My voice sounds weird due to the large amount of water%Nin my nose.%K%P

0x500
Yuka「Jeesh, whaa ah yuu doin'...!」%K%P

0x50C
I frown while climbing out of the pool.%K%P

0x528
Makoto「I can see right through you.」%K%P

0x53C
Yuka「W-Whaa ah yuu tocking abaut?」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「You were planning on letting me go, right?」%K%P

0x570
(―Ugh!)%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「It was obvious.」%K%P

0x590
I'm so dejected that my shoulders drop.%K%P

0x59C
Makoto「So now we're even...」%K%P

0x5A8
Yuka「...No.」%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x5C8
Yuka「No way, no way! We're not even at all!」%K%P

0x5D4
Yuka「After all, no matter how you think about it, I haven't done%Nanything to you.」%K%P

0x5E0
Yuka「I'm the 'victim', and you're the 'assailant', right!?」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「Ugh...!」%K%P

0x5F8
Makoto「...Th-Then how can I make it up to you?」%K%P

0x60C
(Hee hee hee... Makoto is so predictable.)%K%P

0x618
Yuka「Well, if you insist, then...♪」%K%P

0x624
Makoto suddenly smiles.%K%P

0x630
Makoto「Yeah, I'll get you one cup of anything... except alcohol.」%K%P

0x63C
...It seems I'm the one who is predictable...%K%P

0x650
Makoto「Ah, your nose is dripping with snot... how dirty!」%K%P

0x678
(―!!!!!)%K%P

0x68C
Yuka「U-U-Ughhhh...」%K%P

0x698
As my body trembles with rising anger, I clench my hands%Ninto fists.%K%P

0x6A4
(Is that any way to treat a girl!?)%K%P

0x6B0
Makoto「Ah...」%K%P

0x6BC
Makoto「Are you... mad at me?」%K%P

0x6D0
Yuka「I'm not!」%K%P

0x6DC
Pissed off, I shout this in defiance of Makoto's%Ncomposed words and attitude.%K%P

0x6E8
If say "I'm mad", then it'll kinda feel like I've lost to him.%K%P

0x6F4
But boy, is his face looking really punchable right about%Nnow...%K%P

0x700
Makoto「All right! Got it! It can't be helped, so I'll treat you to a%Ndrink!」%K%P

0x70C
...He said it.%K%P

0x718
Those simple words "I'll treat you to a drink" have rapidly%Nbrightened my vision.%K%P

0x72C
Yuka「Huh? Beer?♪」%K%P

0x738
Makoto「Dumbass! I'm not letting you drink alcohol!」%K%P

0x74C
Yuka「Whyyyy not...?」%K%P

0x758
Makoto「You know why!」%K%P

0x764
Yuka「Boo...」%K%P

0x770
Makoto「Well, I'll go and buy you something appropriate... so wait%Nhere.」%K%P

0x794
He says that, and heads over to the drink stand...%K%P

0x7A0
As I stare at him walking away, I realize something.%K%P

0x7AC
Right now, I can't feel a single fragment of the%Ndepression I felt earlier...%K%P

0x7B8
(Hmm...)%K%P

0x7C4
(Looks like I don't need that beer right now after all...)%K%P

0x7D0
Having reached that conclusion, I nod to myself.%K%P

0x854
After I've had lunch, I sit down in the deck chair again,%Nand blankly stare at the scene before my my eyes.%K%P

0x860
Well, it's slightly different from earlier, as I have a cup of%Nbeer in my hand...%K%P

0x874
I gulp down the beer while foam covers my lips.%K%P

0x888
Yuka「Fwah...!」%K%P

0x894
A comfortable stimulus like an electric shock travels%Ndown my entire body through my throat.%K My whole body%Nis wrapped up in an uplifting feeling.%K%P

0x8A0
Thanks to that, I stop thinking of unnecessary things.%K%P

0x8AC
The words "good wine makes good blood" come to mind.%K%P

0x8B8
(The power of alcohol is really amazing♪)%K%P

0x8C4
I am embraced by a feeling of ectasy...%K%P

0x8D0
...%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「Ah, Yuka! Not again!」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto spots me, then frantically runs over to where I am.%K%P

0x8F4
Yuka「Ah, Mako-tan♪ Doo yuu wanna drink too?」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「Hell no! How many times do I have to tell you until you%Nunderstand!?」%K%P

0x90C
He violently snatches the beer from my hand.%K%P

0x918
Yuka「Aaaah! Whaa da hell ah yuu doin'!!」%K%P

0x924
I take the stolen beer back from Makoto.%K%P

0x930
Yuka「Dish ish maine!」%K%P

0x93C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x950
Yuka「Gulp, gulp...♪」%K%P

0x95C
Makoto「Hey, Yuka...」%K%P

0x970
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x97C
Makoto「How many have you had?」%K%P

0x988
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x994
Makoto「I'm asking you how many cups of beer you've had.」%K%P

0x9A8
Yuka「Umm... well...」%K%P

0x9B4
Yuka「1... 2...」%K%P

0x9C0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x9D4
Yuka「Eye dunno.」%K%P

0x9E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9F4
Yuka「Gulp, gulp...♪」%K%P

0xA00
Makoto「Hey... I'll remind you of something so that you don't forget.」%K%P

0xA14
Yuka「??」%K%P

0xA20
Makoto「It's about Saki...」%K%P

0xA2C
He says that, and snatches the cup from my hand a%Nsecond time.%K%P

0xA40
Yuka「AHH!!!!」%K%P

0xA4C
Makoto firmly grips my shoulders, looks at me with a%Nserious expression, then quickly begins to explain.%K%P

0xA58
My mind is fuzzy, so I barely understand anything he%Nsays, but I do catch the words "fishing" and "it'll be a big%Nproblem if we go."%K%P

0xA6C
Yuka「Ish faine, ish faine!」%K%P

0xA78
Yuka「If we don't go fishin', then ishent it arright?」%K%P

0xA84
Even so, Makoto's expression is uneasy...%K%P

0xA90
Yuka「Eyem tellin' yuu, ish faine!」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAA8
Makoto「Fine, I'll trust you...」%K%P

0xAB4
Makoto holds out the cup while saying this.%K%P

0xAC0
Yuka「Leef it to me! Nahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0xACC
And, at that time...%K%P

0xB34
Izumi「Hello, Makoto-kun, Yuka-chan.」%K%P

0xB40
...Suddenly, Izumi-san appears from behind us.%K%P

0xB4C
Makoto「GYAAA!?!?!?」%K%P

0xB80
He spills the beer all over my head.%K%P

0xB8C
Yuka「Ug h... yuu shuck...」%K%P

0xBA0
Izumi「What are you two doing?」%K%P

0xBAC
Makoto「Ah... no... uh... nothing really.」%K%P

0xBB8
Makoto「M-More importantly, how long have you been there...?」%K%P

0xBCC
Izumi「...I got here just now.」%K%P

0xBD8
Makoto「I-Is that so? ...Whew.」%K%P

0xBE4
Izumi「??」%K%P

0xBF0
Makoto「Oh, that's right, Haruka called for me!!」%K%P

0xBFC
With that, Makoto suddenly runs away.%K%P

0xC10
Izumi「?????」%K%P

0xC1C
Izumi-san tilts her head in confusion, while I, being left%Nbehind, make an indignant face, feeling uncomfortable all%Nthe while...%K%P

0xCAC
After that, I took a shower.%K%P

0xCB8
Thanks to that, I finally sobered up by the time I got%Nback...%K%P

0xCC4
Right now, I'm sitting in a deck chair next to Izumi-san.%K%P

0xCD0
In my right hand is a cup full of beer, while Izumi-san is%Ndrinking black tea.%K%P

0xCDC
The gentle afternoon begins to pass by ever so slowly...%K%P

0xCE8
Suddenly, Izumi-san looks over towards the water slide.%K%P

0xCF4
I do the same.%K%P

0xD00
...I see Makoto and Haruka sliding down it together.%K%P

0xD0C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xD18
Just when they reach the bottom, Haruka tugs on%NMakoto's arm, and the two of them head to the staircase%Ntogether.%K%P

0xD24
It seems they're going for a return trip.%K%P

0xD38
Izumi「Makoto's getting along well with her.」%K%P

0xD44
Yuka「You're right...」%K%P

0xD50
Yuka「But it feels like Haruka is dragging Makoto along, doesn't%Nit?」%K%P

0xD5C
Haruka is dragging along the completely exhausted%NMakoto. I can tell that much from here.%K%P

0xD70
Izumi「Sorry, I was thinking aloud. When I said 'her', I was%Nreferring to you, Yuka.」%K%P

0xD7C
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0xD88
Thump...%K My heart gives a little jump.%K%P

0xD9C
Izumi「You two seem quite close, don't you?」%K%P

0xDA8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xDB4
Izumi「I can't believe it. After all, the two of you only just met%Neach other♪」%K%P

0xDC0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xDD4
Izumi「Hey, what's really going on between you two?」%K%P

0xDE0
Yuka「N-Nothing...」%K%P

0xDEC
Izumi「Really...? But earlier, you two were...」%K%P

0xDF8
Izumi「...Now that I think about it, what were you and Makoto-kun%Ntalking about earlier?」%K%P

0xE04
Yuka「W-Who knows...?」%K%P

0xE18
Izumi「Oh? Is it a secret between you two?」%K%P

0xE24
Yuka「I really don't know. I completely forgot when I sobered%Nup...」%K%P

0xE30
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0xE44
I only give a vague answer.%K%P

0xE50
...Well, half of it's a lie, but...%K%P

0xE5C
Now that I've sobered up, I can guess the general idea%Nof what he was saying.%K%P

0xE68
After this comes the incident where Saki almost%Ndrowned...%K%P

0xE74
What should we do in order to prevent that...?%K%P

0xE80
...Naturally, I can't tell anyone else about it.%K%P

0xE8C
I give a sidelong glance at Izumi-san.%K%P

0xE98
Having fortunately already lost interest in our topic,%NIzumi-san is happily enjoying the fragrance of a new cup%Nof black tea.%K%P

0xEA4
Before long, our conversation has completely ceased...%K%P

0xEB0
I casually glance at the other side of the pool.%K%P

0xEBC
(Oh...?)%K%P

0xEC8
Having finally part ways with Haruka, Makoto is currently%Ncaught up in conversation with Saki.%K%P

0xED4
(What are they talking about...?)%K%P

0xEE0
The two of them burst into laughter.%K%P

0xEEC
Especially Saki, whose laughing is so loud that I can hear%Nit from all the way over here...%K%P

0xEF8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xF04
I feel a prickling pain in my chest.%K%P

0xF10
Not only is my chest in pain, but it's also hard to breathe,%Ncausing my body to get hot.%K%P

0xF1C
For some reason, looking at this scene makes me sick.%K%P

0xF28
Then all I have to do is not look at it...%K But strangely, I%Ncan't look away from them.%K%P

0xF34
...%K%P

0xF40
A little bit later, it seems that Makoto has decided to%Ntreat her to a drink, as he walks towards the drink stand.%K%P

0xF4C
While my eyes follow Makoto, I speak to Izumi-san.%K%P

0xF58
Yuka「Hey, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xF6C
Izumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0xF78
Yuka「Do you think there are people... with 'exact%Nresemblances'?」%K%P

0xF8C
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xF98
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xFAC
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0xFB8
Izumi「I think that there are blood relatives who have similar%Nfaces and personalities, right...?」%K%P

0xFC4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xFD0
Yuka「Then let's just say they don't resemble each other at all%Non the surface...」%K%P

0xFDC
Yuka「Even so, do you think there are pairs of people like that%Nin this world?」%K%P

0xFF0
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0xFFC
Her gaze wanders around for a bit...%K%P

0x1010
Izumi「Mmm... I wonder, do they really?」%K%P

0x101C
She quietly looks at the pool.%K%P

0x1030
Izumi「Yuka-chan, have you met someone like that?」%K%P

0x103C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1048
The swaying and waving water shimmers in the sunlight.%K%P

0x1054
...It glitters like that night sky.%K%P

0x1060
Yuka「...No.」%K%P

0x106C
Yuka「I just asked out of curiosity...」%K%P

0x1078
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1084
Yuka「Aah, I mustn't get drunk...」%K%P

0x1098
But despite my words, I end up drinking several cups of%Nbeer.%K%P

0x10A4
I'm bitter...%K I don't know why, but that's how I feel.%K%P

0x1168
As the day goes on, the temperature drops%Nconsiderably, and so we get ready to leave for%NLunabeach.%K%N

0x1174
At that time, I'm so drunk that I can barely walk.%K%N

0x1180
That's no wonder...%K%N

0x118C
In total, I drank no less than twenty cups of beer...%K%N%N

0x1198
But!%K It's all Makoto's fault!!!%K%P

0x11AC
In the time I've been worrying about everything, Makoto%Nhas been enjoying himself!%K%N

0x11B8
Because he neglected me like that, I had no choice but%Nto just drink it all away!!!%K%N%N

0x11C4
As I continue to mentally complain, I force myself to chug%Ndown more beer.%K%N%N

0x11D0
Before long, my anger and thought processes fly away%Ntowards a distant dimension...%K%P

0x1240
Just like we did on our way here, we go back through%NMoon Beach.%K%P

0x124C
On the way back, Makoto grabs my hand while continuing%Nto sprout gibberish.%K%P

0x1258
Makoto「All right, Yuka? You can't say or have 'toro', got it?」%K%P

0x126C
Yuka「Huh? ...Did yuu shay 'toro'?」%K%P

0x1280
Yuka「Shilly Mako-tan, we're naht in a bullfightin' arena!」%K%P

0x128C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x12A0
Makoto makes a sour face and furrows his eyebrows. I%Ncan't tell whether it's from being unable to stomach my%Nreply or from being overwhelmed by the stench of%Nalcohol in my breath.%K%P

0x12AC
Makoto「Then I'll try saying it another way...」%K%P

0x12B8
Makoto「All right, Yuka? You must absolutely not say 'I want to eat%Ntuna', okay?」%K%P

0x12C4
This time, I don't understand him at all...%K%P

0x12D0
But his whispers are tickling me, so I just give a suitable%Nnod of affirmation.%K%P

0x12DC
Makoto「Do you really understand?」%K%P

0x12F0
Yuka「Geesh, don't worree abaut it... Eye got it!」%K%P

0x1304
So he must mean "toro" as in the fatty part of tuna. Um...%Nso I can't have "toro", right?%K%P

0x1310
Yeah, yeah, yeah...%K Of course I understand that.%K%P

0x131C
So the next time I'm at a sushi shop, I'll just order a "sea%Nurchin" instead.%K%P

0x13A0
Kurumi「Morning!」%K%P

0x13AC
When we arrive at Lunabeach, we are greeted by the%Nnow completely cheerful Kurumi-chan.%K%P

0x13B8
I feel jealous of her youth and her quick recovery ability.%K%P

0x13C4
And then...%K%P

0x13E0
Yuka「Eye have jusht come up wif shomefing amashin'!」%K%P

0x13EC
Makoto「Yeah, yeah, when you cross Kurumi and milk, you get%N'Kurumilk'...Now let's move on!」%K%P

0x13F8
...Makoto's sense of humor is like an old-timer's.%K%P

0x140C
Kurumi「Kyahahahahahahaha♪ Well done! That's great!」%K%P

0x1420
Yuka「Gyahahahahahahaha♪ Makoto... yer too funee...♪」%K%P

0x142C
Yuka「Yuu jusht meid a portmanteau...♪」%K%P

0x1438
Yuka「Makoto, yer too much...♪」%K%P

0x1444
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1458
And then, when I finish laughing...%K%P

0x1464
Yuka「Haah...」%K%P

0x1470
When I finish laughing...%K%P

0x1494
Yuka「To... to... to...」%K%P

0x14A0
Suddenly, I feel a certain desire welling up.%K%P

0x14AC
My whole body shakes with this strong wish, completely%Nstealing away any reason I had left.%K%P

0x14B8
Yuka「To... to... to...」%K%P

0x14C4
...Oh?%K Why does Makoto seem to be foaming at the%Nmouth...?%K%P

0x14D0
...But I ignore him.%K%P

0x14DC
Yuka「To... to... to...」%K%P

0x14F8
Yuka「Tower.」%K%P

0x1504
Makoto「?????」%K%P

0x1510
Yuka「Eye wanna shee... da lighthoushe tower...」%K%P

0x1524
Yuka「Eye wanna shee da lighthoushe tower!!」%K%P

0x1590
And thus, in order to see the lighthouse tower, we go to%NViewpoint Park at the tip of the cape.%K%P

0x159C
The five besides Kurumi and I are standing by the cherry%Nblossoms before the park.%K%P

0x15A8
Now that I think about it, this is the first time Saki, Haruka,%Nand Okuhiko-kun have seen the cherry blossoms here.%K%P

0x15B4
That amazing sight may be overwhelming them.%K%P

0x15C0
Well, anyway, in order to fulfill my desire, Kurumi-chan and%NI play around the lighthouse tower.%K%P

0x15CC
Round and round the lighthouse tower...%K%P

0x15D8
We chase each other like children in a daze.%K%P

0x15E4
At this moment, I haven't realized it yet.%K%P

0x15F0
My actions have resulted in preventing that terrible%Nevent from happening...%K%P

0x166C
We pass the time in Viewpoint Park idly.%K%P

0x1678
One person admires the cherry blossoms in full bloom...%K%NAnother's thoughts turn to what lies beyond the sea...%K%P

0x1684
...And yet another person frolics like an innocent child%Nwhile trying to claw their way up the lighthouse...%K%P

0x1690
Incidentally, the one trying to climb up the lighthouse is...%K%P

0x169C
...%K%P

0x16A8
...Well, that's a secret.%K%P

0x16B4
And so, it's finally the end of the afternoon...%K%P

0x16C0
By the time I'm gazing at this setting sun, I've completely%Nsobered up.%K%P

0x16CC
The seven of us are lined in a row by the cape's fence,%Nwatching the bright red sun as it sinks below the horizon.%K%P

0x16D8
Is it just my imagination, or does it feel like the sun's%Nsetting at a faster speed than usual?%K%P

0x16E4
It's like a smoothly descending curtain.%K%P

0x16F0
I feel a little reluctance to see it set and go away...%K%P

0x16FC
I casually turn my attention towards the scenery around%Nme.%K%P

0x1708
Because of the setting sun, the scenery is dyed red.%K%P

0x1714
Everything before my eyes is a bright red color that%Nmakes it look like it's burning...%K%P

0x1720
The current time is 4:38 P.M.%K%P

0x172C
The event where Saki nearly drowned has been erased%Nfrom this time axis.%K%P

0x1738
With this, it's likely that Saki and Haruka's quarrel%Ntomorrow won't happen.%K%P

0x1744
There's nothing to worry about...%K Even so...%K%P

0x1758
Even so, what is this growing feeling of anxiety in my%Nchest?%K%P

0x1764
This red world makes me uneasy...%K It feels like as if the%Nanxiety flowing into my beating heart is like light shining%Nin from the cracks of a ceiling in a dark room...%K%P

0x1770
My body faintly trembles.%K%P

0x17B0
...Suddenly, I feel warmth in my left hand.%K%P

0x17BC
When I look, I see that Makoto is gripping my hand.%K%P

0x17C8
His face is turned straight towards the setting sun.%K%P

0x17D4
Pleasant heat passes into my left hand.%K%P

0x17E0
It's a serene feeling...%K ...Like being wrapped up in a warm,%Nsoft feather.%K%P

0x17EC
I... gently grasp his hand back.%K I get a strong reaction%Nfrom his hand.%K%P

0x17F8
Makoto is staring beyond the sea.%K%P

0x1804
But it doesn't seem like his pink dyed cheeks are from%Nthe setting sunlight alone...%K%P

0x1810
I find it extremely funny, but I suppress a laugh in my%Nthroat.%K%P

0x181C
Before I know it, the turbulent ocean in my heart has%Ncalmed down and returned to normal.%K%P

0x1828
My anxiety has disappeared to parts unknown.%K%P

0x1834
I look towards the direction of the shrine.%K%P

0x1840
I think I can stay like this for a little while.%K%P

0x184C
Even if it's only for an extremely short amount of time...%K%P

0x1858
Please allow me this peace.%K%P

0x1864
Please, god of time...%K%P

0x1900
We wait until the sun has completely set, then return to%NLunabeach.%K%N

0x190C
This is the third time I've watched the sunset on this%Nisland.%K%N

0x1918
Suddenly, I remember the promise Makoto and I%Nexchanged.%K%N%N

0x1924
"We'll see the morning of April 7th together."%K%N%N

0x1930
I won't stop believing until I see the beauty of the%Nmorning I've never seen.%K%P

0x19CC
We are treated to dinner at Lunabeach.%K%P

0x19D8
After dinner, we say goodbye to Izumi-san and%NKurumi-chan, and go outside.%K%P

0x19E4
Right after that...%K%P

0x19F8
Kurumi「Oh! Kurumi almost forgot!」%K%P

0x1A04
Kurumi-chan comes out again alone.%K%P

0x1A10
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x1A1C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x1A30
Kurumi「From now on, Kurumi has decided to call Okuhiko-kun%N'Okkun'♪」%K%P

0x1A3C
Kurumi「And she's decided to call Makoto-kun Onii-chan'♪」%K%P

0x1A48
Both of them accept these nicknames.%K%P

0x1A54
In fact, Makoto seems to have been looking forward to%Nthis, as he is now smiling.%K%P

0x1A60
"Okkun"...%K "Onii-chan"...%K%P

0x1A6C
It's a familiar sound that makes my heart tremble...%K%P

0x1B0C
Right now, we're walking on Moon Beach.%K%P

0x1B18
Like last time, the others are returning to the lodge via%Nthe paved road.%K%P

0x1B24
After we parted from Kurumi-chan, I told Makoto-kun that I%Nwanted "the two of us to talk alone", and so we decided%Ntook a different route from the others.%K%P

0x1B30
Haruka and Okuhiko-kun seemed kinda curious about%Nwhat we're up to, but they don't seem to be looking into it.%K%P

0x1B3C
However, just before we parted, Saki let out some%Ndisgruntled words...%K%P

0x1B48
... ... ...%K%P

0x1B54
The moon is alone in the sky.%K%P

0x1B60
Light shines down from it.%K%P

0x1B6C
The moonlight illuminates the black sea, causing the light%Nto reflect off of it and making the waves breaking on the%Nocean sparkle with a silver sheen.%K%P

0x1B78
Is the tide rising right now?%K Or is it fading away?%K%P

0x1B84
The silver waves just come back and forth, back and%Nforth...%K%P

0x1B90
That dull rhythm keeps repeating itself over and over.%K%P

0x1BA8
Yuka「Wouldn't you say things are going better than we%Nthought?」%K%P

0x1BB4
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x1BC0
Yes... so far, our plan's running smoothly.%K%P

0x1BCC
If this continues, everything in these six days will create%Na good history, and nothing bad will happen.%K%P

0x1BD8
Makoto「Hey...?」%K%P

0x1BE4
While staring at the ocean, Makoto mutters this.%K%P

0x1C08
I turn around, as if to say "What?"%K%P

0x1C14
Makoto「Somewhere in this ocean lies the other bell...」%K%P

0x1C20
Makoto「Our lifeline...」%K%P

0x1C34
Yuka「Yeah...」%K%P

0x1C40
Makoto「And... that bell will wash up on this beach tomorrow%Nafternoon... right?」%K%P

0x1C4C
Yuka「...Yeah.」%K%P

0x1C58
I nod while touching the bell in my pocket.%K%P

0x1C64
In the last loop, I definitely picked up the bell on the%Nafternoon of the 3rd.%K%P

0x1C70
That's why we decided yesterday that we would resume%Nthe search for that bell tomorrow afternoon.%K%P

0x1C84
Yuka「We'll look for it tomorrow together, right?」%K%P

0x1C90
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1C9C
Makoto「No... I won't.」%K%P

0x1CA8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1CB4
Makoto「You know what a time paradox is, right?」%K

0x2FA8
I know.

0x2FB4
I don't know.

0x1CF4
Yuka「Theoretically, it's an inconsistency that could possibly%Nbe created by time travel... right?」%K%P

0x1D00
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x1D0C
Apparently finding it comical to hear me say something%Nlike "theoretically", Makoto nods while holding back a%Nlaugh.%K%P

0x1D18
Yuka「In other words...」%K%P

0x1D24
Yuka「Let's say I used a time machine, and went back to a%Nperiod of time way before my own mom was born.」%K%P

0x1D30
Yuka「And there, I stopped my mom's mom, in other words, my%Ngrandma, from marrying my grandpa...」%K%P

0x1D3C
Yuka「...Then it's possible my mom wouldn't be born...」%K%P

0x1D48
Yuka「And, if my mom wasn't born, then naturally, I would never%Nhave been born either.」%K%P

0x1D54
Yuka「But I'm still existing.」%K%P

0x1D60
Yuka「So the question is 'Just what am I?'」%K%P

0x1D6C
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x1D78
Makoto「But even if the balance of history is altered by that one%Nstep, there's an easy way to think about it that'll make%Nperfect sense.」%K%P

0x1D84
Yuka「??」%K%P

0x1D90
Makoto「In other words, to use your example, even if your%Ngrandmother didn't give birth to your mother...」%K%P

0x1D9C
Makoto「A different married couple somewhere in the world would%Nstill give birth to your mother, and in the end, your mother%Nand father would still meet...」%K%P

0x1DA8
Yuka「And I would be born...?」%K%P

0x1DC4
Yuka「A time paradox...?」%K%P

0x1DD0
Makoto「Theoretically, it's an inconsistency that could possibly%Nbe created by time travel.」%K%P

0x1DE4
Yuka「I-I see...」%K%P

0x1DF0
It's kinda funny hearing the word "theoretically" coming%Nfrom Makoto.%K%P

0x1DFC
Makoto「To explain it simply...」%K%P

0x1E08
Makoto「Let's say I had a time machine, and went back in time to a%Nperiod way before my mom was born.」%K%P

0x1E14
Makoto「And there, I stopped my mom's mom, in other words, my%Ngrandma, from marrying my grandpa...」%K%P

0x1E20
Makoto「...Then it's possible that my mom wouldn't be born...」%K%P

0x1E2C
Makoto「And, if my mom wasn't born, it's only natural that I wouldn't%Nbe born either.」%K%P

0x1E38
Makoto「But I'm still existing.」%K%P

0x1E44
Makoto「So the question is 'Just what am I'?」%K%P

0x1E50
Yuka「Huh...」%K%P

0x1E5C
Makoto「But even if the balance of history is altered by that one%Nstep, there's an easy way to think about it that'll make%Nperfect sense.」%K%P

0x1E68
Yuka「??」%K%P

0x1E74
Makoto「In other words, to use my example, even if my gradma%Ndidn't give birth to my mom...」%K%P

0x1E80
Makoto「A different married couple somewhere in the world would%Nstill give birth to my mom, and in the end, my mom and old%Nman would still meet...」%K%P

0x1E8C
Yuka「And you'd be born...?」%K%P

0x1E98
Makoto「That's right... If you think that way, then that means no%Nmatter what happens, history can't change...」%K%P

0x1EA4
"No matter what happens, history can't change."%K%P

0x1EB0
Those are very unpleasant words...%K%P

0x1EBC
Makoto「Of course... this is nothing more than an empty theory,%Nright?」%K%P

0x1EC8
Makoto says that with a smile, as if he was reading my%Nmind.%K%P

0x1ED4
Makoto「In short, what I want to say is...」%K%P

0x1EE0
Yuka「If you also go searching for the bell tomorrow, then we%Nwon't find it?」%K%P

0x1EEC
Makoto「Right. Of course, there's still a possibility that it won't be%Na problem and that we might find it anyway, but...」%K%P

0x1F00
Yuka「Hmm... if that's the case, then it doesn't matter which one%Nwe do, as the probability won't change, right?」%K%P

0x1F0C
Yuka「And besides, the 'us' in this time have done quite%Ndifferent things than last time, correct?」%K%P

0x1F18
Yuka「Saki didn't nearly drown... and-」%K%P

0x1F24
Makoto「Yeah, I know. The fact that we're right here itself has%Nalready made things different from the last loop.」%K%P

0x1F38
Yuka「Then... isn't it okay if we search together?」%K%P

0x1F44
The thought of me searching for the bell alone is%Nextraordinarily discouraging.%K%P

0x1F50
That's why I've been by Makoto's side all this time up until%Nnow...%K%P

0x1F5C
Makoto「Possibly... but you know what?」%K%P

0x1F68
Makoto「To us, finding the bell is a good event.」%K%P

0x1F74
Makoto「Think about it. We're doing everything we can to change%Nthe bad events into good ones. But we absolutely don't%Nwant to change anything related to the good events.」%K%P

0x1F80
Makoto「To reproduce that good event... means repeating the%Nevents of the good event itself!」%K%P

0x1F8C
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x1F98
Makoto「...I have a bad feeling about what could happen if we%Nsearch together.」%K%P

0x1FA4
Makoto「When it came to the first bell, the time it was looked for%Nand the number of people looking for it changed, so the%None who found it changed...」%K%P

0x1FB0
Makoto「The next time might be the same.」%K%P

0x1FBC
Makoto「If we go search together, then we might luckily find it, but...」%K%P

0x1FD0
Yuka「You're saying someone else might pick it up before us...」%K%P

0x1FDC
Makoto slowly nods while he continues to talk.%K%P

0x1FE8
Makoto「This isn't a simple problem.」%K%P

0x1FF4
Makoto「It's already impossible to even attempt to guess the%Nchanges that will occur in the future as a result of our%Nactions...」%K%P

0x2000
Makoto「But history will surely change...」%K%P

0x200C
Makoto「No, we will MAKE history change!」%K%P

0x2018
Makoto「In order to do that, I think it'd be safest if we repeat%Nevents that created a good result.」%K%P

0x2024
Makoto「There are parts of history we should change, and parts%Nof history we shouldn't change...」%K%P

0x2030
Makoto「If the result is unforseeable, then... I want to trust my%Nintuition!」%K%P

0x203C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x207C
I silently gaze at the beach.%K%P

0x2088
The silver waves just come back and forth, back and%Nforth... This monotonous pattern keeps repeating itself%Nover and over.%K%P

0x2094
Is the tide rising right now?%K Or is it fading away?%K%P

0x20A0
I slowly take off my shoes and socks, and step towards%Nthe ocean.%K%P

0x20AC
The waves drench my feet.%K%P

0x20B8
It's pleasantly cool...%K ...And it's very comfortable.%K%P

0x20C4
I slowly turn away from the salty ocean wind.%K%P

0x20E4
Yuka「...Got it.」%K%P

0x20F0
Yuka「I'll search for the bell alone tomorrow...」%K%P

0x20FC
Yuka「And... I'll definitely find it!!」%K%P

0x213C
I still feel discouraged.%K I still want Makoto's help.%K%P

0x2148
But... but...%K%P

0x2154
Makoto「Yeah, I'll leave it to you!」%K%P

0x2160
...I want to see that smile.%K ...I want to become Makoto's%Nstrength.%K%P

0x216C
At the very least, I've become Makoto's strength for now.%K%P

0x2178
Makoto「All right...」%K%P

0x2184
Suddenly, Makoto also takes off his shoes and socks,%Nand throws them aside.%K%P

0x2190
He runs over to me.%K%P

0x219C
Makoto「I'm in a rather good mood now, so I felt like joining you.」%K%P

0x21A8
Even though I'm making a dubious face, Makoto smiles as%Nhe says this.%K%P

0x21B4
Suddenly, I notice that our shadows are overlapping%Neach other.%K%P

0x21C0
The waves just come back and forth, back and forth,%Nrunning over the shadows...%K%P

0x21CC
The shadows don't sway, and continue to remain in place.%K%P

0x21D8
Makoto「Ah!」%K%P

0x21E4
Just then, Makoto speaks up.%K%P

0x21F8
A shooting star streams across the night sky...%K%P

0x2204
―I've gotta make a wish!%K%P

0x2210
I instantly make a firm, powerful wish...%K%P

0x221C
Before long, the shooting star moves far away and%Ndisappears.%K%P

0x2230
Makoto「...Yuka?」%K%P

0x2244
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x2250
Makoto「What did you wish for?」%K%P

0x225C
Yuka「...What about you?」%K%P

0x2268
Makoto「I-It was...」%K%P

0x2274
Makoto「...for you to find the bell tomorrow...」%K%P

0x2280
Yuka「I see.」%K%P

0x228C
Makoto「...So, what'd you wish for?」%K%P

0x2298
Yuka「I...」%K%P

0x22A4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x22B8
Yuka「...I'm not telling♪」%K%P

0x22C4
Makoto「Huh? What's up with that?」%K%P

0x22D0
Yuka「Heh heh... you want me to tell you?」%K%P

0x22DC
Makoto「It's because I wanted you to tell me that I asked in the%Nfirst place!」%K%P

0x22F0
Yuka「Ah! I don't like that attitude of yours!」%K%P

0x22FC
Yuka「That's it, I'm not telling!」%K%P

0x2308
Makoto「...Th-That's unfair! So I'm the only one who said it!?」%K%P

0x231C
Yuka「It wasn't really anything that big, so you're not missing%Nout on much.」%K%P

0x2328
Makoto「If it's not that big, then you can tell me, can't you?」%K%P

0x233C
Yuka「...It's a little personal... You understand, right?」%K%P

0x2348
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2354
Makoto「...Then can you promise me something?」%K%P

0x2368
Yuka「Okay.」%K%P

0x2374
Makoto「Don't forget these words, all right?」%K%P

0x2388
Yuka「Sure.」%K%P

0x2394
Makoto「'Promises must definitely be kept.'」%K%P

0x23A8
Yuka「Y-Yeah... I know that!」%K%P

0x23B4
Makoto「Good... Well then, it's high time we head back.」%K%P

0x23C8
We put on our shoes and start walking towards the%Nlodge.%K%P

0x23D4
While walking, I mentally repeat the wish I made earlier one%Nore time.%K%P

0x23E0
The wish I made on that shooting star of hope...%K%P

0x23F4
"I wish that we'll always be together...!"%K%P

0x2400
My wish...%K%P

0x240C
My wish... is something that cannot be conveyed in%Nwords...%K%P

0x2474
We start climbing up the hill road while exchanging trivial%Nconversation.%K%P

0x24AC
And then, at the time the lodge begins to come into our%Nfield of vision...%K%P

0x24B8
??「Welcome back.」%K%P

0x24C4
Yuka「!?」%K%P

0x24D0
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x2500
Saki is standing there with her arms crossed.%K%P

0x251C
Yuka「...Huh? Saki, why are you...」%K%P

0x2528
Makoto「You didn't go back yet...?」%K%P

0x2534
Saki「It took you quite a long time to come back, so I got%Nworried.」%K%P

0x2548
Saki undoes her crossed arms, and slowly approaches%Nus.%K%P

0x2554
Saki「Nevertheless, you two are getting along real well...」%K%P

0x2568
While she says that, she looks back and forth between%NMakoto and I.%K%P

0x2574
Her tone seems incredibly sharp and biting...%K%P

0x2580
Makoto「...What? If you've got something you want to say, say it%Nclearly.」%K%P

0x258C
When he says that, Saki's tone changes...%K%P

0x25A0
Saki「Don't get so angry... Now you're making me even more%Nworried...」%K%P

0x25AC
Makoto「Oh, umm...」%K%P

0x25B8
Makoto「...Sorry about that... err... We got a little caught up in our%Nconversation...」%K%P

0x25CC
Saki「No... it's okay. As long as you came back all right, that's%Ngood enough...」%K%P

0x25D8
Makoto「I-I see...」%K%P

0x25EC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x25F8
I feel a surge of anger flaring up in my chest from of their%Nconversation...%K%P

0x260C
Yuka「...Well then, your business is all done, isn't it? We're going%Ninside now, so why don't you head on home too?」%K%P

0x2618
I aggressively tug on Makoto's arm as I try to pass by%NSaki.%K%P

0x262C
Saki「...Wait! I still haven't finished my business yet.」%K%P

0x2638
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x2644
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x2658
Saki「I... want to talk to Yuka.」%K%P

0x266C
Yuka「Huh? W-With me...?」%K%P

0x2678
Saki nods.%K%P

0x2684
Yuka「Wh-Why...?」%K%P

0x2698
Saki「...Well, you see...」%K%P

0x26A4
Just then, Saki glances at Makoto.%K%P

0x26B0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x26BC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x26D0
Saki「...No, never mind. Maybe next time...」%K%P

0x26DC
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x26E8
Makoto「Hmm? Is it me? Am I being a third wheel or something? If%Nthat's the case, I'll go away...」%K%P

0x26F4
Saki「No... it's fine. I've decided that I need to give this more%Nthought before talking about it.」%K%P

0x2708
Saki「Yes... I haven't put my thoughts together yet...」%K%P

0x2714
Yuka「...??」%K%P

0x2728
Saki「Well then... goodnight.」%K%P

0x273C
With just those words, she slips right past me.%K%P

0x2748
When she passes me, I smell a sweet scent wrapped%Naround Saki's body.%K%P

0x2754
It smells like the sweet aroma of flowers...%K%P

0x2760
Before long, Saki has disappeared into the darkness.%K%P

0x276C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2778
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2784
All that's left is the two of us, standing there as we%Nexchange glances...%K%P

0x2808
I take a bath, brush my teeth, change my clothes, and lie%Non my bed.%K%P

0x2814
I look at the clock, and find it's close to 10:00 P.M.%K%P

0x2820
Yuka「Fwaah～...」%K%P

0x282C
I open my mouth widely, and yawn loudly.%K Anyway, I'm%Ndead tired...%K%P

0x2838
Last night, I almost got no sleep, and on top of that, I've%Nbeen very busy for the last two days.%K%P

0x2844
I don't even know if I've locked the door, as I'm too tired%Nto check.%K%P

0x2850
(Tomorrow... what happens tomorrow?)%K%P

0x285C
I desperately review the facts of tomorrow's events in%Nmy head to affirm.%K%P

0x2868
(Tomorrow... after breakfast, we went to tennis as%Nscheduled...)%K%P

0x2874
(...We took a break to eat Saki's sandwiches , we%Ncontinued playing ...I went shopping...)%K%P

0x2880
(Then I have to go find the bell ...Makoto's lifeline...)%K%P

0x288C
(And then , we had the dinner that Izumi-san made...)%K%P

0x2898
(...H - Huh ?) What did we eat?)%K%P

0x28A4
(...I forgot... )%K%P

0x28B0
(Anyway, we ate Izumi-san's meal...)%K%P

0x28BC
(And then...)%K%P

0x28C8
(And then...)%K%P

0x28D4
I've reached my limit.%K%P

0x28E0
I can't think any more...%K%P

0x28EC
I turn my body, and curl up in the covers.%K%P

0x28F8
As my consciousness fades, I let my body get%Novertaken by sleep.%K%P

0x2904
The world in front of me fades into white.%K%P

0x2918
