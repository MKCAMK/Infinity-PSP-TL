The ceiling is quite drafty...%K%N

0x68
The room is rather spacious...%K%N

0x74
Everything in it is new and well organized, like a%Nshowroom.%K%P

0x80
On the south wall is a huge glass window.%K%N

0x8C
It offers a fantastic view of the vast blue ocean.%K%P

0x98
There's no one else here yet.%K%N

0xA4
Yuka probably went back to her own room.%K%P

0xB0
I feel like relaxing, so I approach the sofa.%K%P

0xBC
Suddenly, I notice someone's placed an aluminum%Nashtray on top of it.%K%N

0xC8
Lying in the ashtray is a lone cigarette butt.%K%P

0xD4
Makoto「Geez, what idiot put an ashtray here of all places...?」%K%P

0xE0
I pick it up and place it on top of a round table in front of%Nme.%K%N

0xEC
With that, I sink into the soft sofa.%K%P

0xF8
Beyond the huge glass window, the morning sun shines%Nin from the east, its reflection sparkling on the ocean.%K%P

0x104
It's quite a breathtaking scenery. Positioning myself so%Nthat I can see it better, I blankly stare out at the ocean%Nfor a while...%K

0x8C8
Try to put my thoughts together.

0x8D4
Just relax.

0x144
I... try to pull my thoughts together.%K%P

0x150
―First, the camp.%K%N

0x15C
Well, I say "camp", but this isn't for a school club or%Nanything.%K%P

0x168
The "Seminar Camp". ... In all of my 20 long years of life,%Nthis is the first time I've ever heard of such a bizarre%Ncamp.%K%P

0x174
Truthfully, I don't really understand much about my%Ncollege's various systems, as I skipped classes often.%K%P

0x180
At the start of last month, when the final exam results%Nand the list of those who were or weren't advancing to%Ntheir next grade were posted, I quickly peeked at the%Nboard, and saw...%K%P

0x18C
"Roster of Literature Department Psychology Major%NSeminar Members."%K%P

0x198
... It was from that announcement that I learned for the%Nfirst time that I was assigned to "The (Something)%NSeminar's 5th Camp Group: Kawashima Party".%K%P

0x1A4
(The Seminar Camp's official name is... Err... I forgot.)%K%P

0x1B0
(But anyway, what the hell does it mean by "Seminar"!?)%K%P

0x1BC
Next to that roster was a sheet of paper, which said...%K%P

0x1C8
(The Seminar Camp is designed to be as an informal%Nsocial gathering between members of each group of the%N(Something) Seminar, as listed.)%K%P

0x1D4
(Due to the capacity of each camping lodge and other%Ncircumstances, each group will be lodging in at a%Ndifferent day and time, so pay close attention to your%Nown.)%K%P

0x1E0
(Furthermore, if you cannot attend for a certain reason,%Nyou must submit a report.)%K%P

0x1EC
(If you don't and are absent without permission, you will%Nimmediately be expelled, regardless of your reasons.)%K%P

0x1F8
... From what I can remember.%K%P

0x204
Ours, the Kawashima Party, was assigned to the lodge%Nfrom (Sunday, March 31st-Sunday, April 7th.)%K%P

0x210
The bottom of the note read: "Other details will be given%Nby your designated group leader. That is all."%K%P

0x21C
Of course, it makes sense that the leader of the%NKawashima Party was Kawashima herself.%K%P

0x228
Right. In other words, that half asleep girl from earlier who%Nbarged into my room.%K%P

0x234
A few days later, she called me about what I'd seen on%Nthe board.%K%P

0x248
Yuka「... Then I'll tell the other two members that 'We have to%Nmeet on-site, no matter what.'」%K%P

0x254
Yuka「... Oh, that's all right. You'll get the boat ticket if you go to%Nthe Student Affairs office...」%K%P

0x260
Yuka「Yeah... Yeah... Um... You'll have until the night of the 31st to%Nget there, so you should be fine.」%K%P

0x26C
Yuka「Well then, I'll see you there!」%K%P

0x280
... I ended up arriving here last night about... a little past%N10:00?%K%P

0x28C
I live about 124 miles from here, but I still managed to%Nmake it here - this island in the middle of nowhere -%Nsafely.%K%P

0x298
Honestly, I feel like I was dragged so far from home for no%Nreason.%K%P

0x2A4
...%K%P

0x2B8
I... think about nothing, and just relax.%K%P

0x2C4
... ... ...%K%P

0x2E0
Soon enough...%K%P

0x308
... The door to the living room slowly opens.%K%P

0x314
The one who comes in is...%K%P

0x350
... Huh??%K%N

0x35C
Oh, yeah. That's right... Come to think of it, I don't think I've%Nheard this girl's name yet...%K%P

0x368
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x374
I greet her cheerfully.%K%P

0x390
??「...」%K%P

0x39C
I wait several seconds for a reply, only to get none in%Nreturn.%K%P

0x3C8
The girl completely ignores me and quickly disappears%Ninto the kitchen, as if nothing had happened.%K%P

0x3D4
No, she might not have ignored me intentionally, as it%Nseemed to be an unconscious and natural behavior for%Nher.%K%P

0x3E0
For instance, if she thought she heard the greeting%Ncoming from the TV, then she probably would have%Nignored it.%K%P

0x3EC
Having been ignored, I become determined to clear up%Nthis "good morning" issue, so I stagger to my feet and%Nhead for the kitchen.%K%P

0x47C
In an attempt to fix the situation, I face her and try to%Nsay "Good morning", again.%K%P

0x488
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x494
??「...」%K%P

0x4BC
Without a word, she turns the sink faucet, filling her glass%Ncup with water.%K%P

0x4C8
With a tiny sound, she drinks the entire cup in one large%Ngulp.%K

0x8E0
Third time's the charm.

0x8EC
Try saying something else.

0x524
I can't give up now.%K%N

0x530
I should keep trying, shouldn't I?%K%P

0x53C
Makoto「Good morning!」%K%P

0x548
The girl places her empty cup at the bottom of the sink%Nand sighs as she mutters...%K%P

0x554
??「Good morning.」%K%P

0x560
However, she says this without looking at me.%K%P

0x56C
It's almost as if she's greeting the water dripping from%Nthe faucet instead.%K%P

0x578
Makoto「Say... Did I... offend you... somehow?」%K%P

0x584
??「Why do you think that?」%K%P

0x590
Her gaze is still fixed on the faucet.%K%P

0x59C
Makoto「Why...? Well, because... Because it kinda feels like you're...%Navoiding me.」%K%P

0x5A8
??「...」%K%P

0x5B4
She doesn't answer me.%K%P

0x5C0
Not only does she not answer, she doesn't move at all.%K%N

0x5CC
At this rate, no matter how much I persist, it feels like%Nshe'll never speak again for all eternity.%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「Sorry.」%K%P

0x5E4
I feel like I need to apologize.%K%N

0x5F0
I probably shouldn't have pestered her like that.%K%P

0x5FC
(I've got to apologize for being rude, right?)%K%P

0x608
Just then, she opens her small mouth to speak.%K%P

0x614
??「It's because...」%K%P

0x624
??「It's because... I'm different...」%K%P

0x658
Makoto「So, did you sleep well last night?」%K%P

0x664
Those words sounded incredibly forced and clich▲d.%K%N

0x670
I feel my face flush from embarrassment.%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「I mean, not to be rude, but you don't look like you slept%Nmuch.」%K%P

0x688
??「...」%K%P

0x694
No answer.%K%N

0x6A0
Instead, the absentminded girl just watches the water%Ndrip from the faucet.%K%P

0x6AC
Makoto「Oh, you're not feeling depressed, are you? After all, you%Nwere taken away from your precious spring break%Nagainst your will. Honestly, I'm bummed about that, too.」%K%P

0x6B8
??「...」%K%P

0x6C4
Makoto「But you know, it can't be helped. It's too late now. So let's%Nmake the best of it. Okay?」%K%P

0x6D0
Makoto「I mean, if we're going to spend the week here, then it'd be%Nbest to pass our time at this camp as optimistically, as%Nproductively, and as energetically as we-」%K%P

0x6DC
??「It's meaningless.」%K%P

0x6E8
The girl says this quite suddenly.%K%P

0x6F4
??「I have nothing to gain from that.」%K%P

0x700
Makoto「'Nothing to gain'...?」%K%P

0x70C
These words make my mouth run dry.%K%N

0x718
I'm speechless.%K%P

0x724
??「Because I...」%K%P

0x734
??「Because I... am nothing...」%K%P

0x740
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x754
Before I can ask again, she slips right by me and returns%Nto the living room.%K%P

0x7AC
Up until earlier, I had been sitting down on the comfy sofa.%K%N

0x7B8
But now, the girl is sitting where I was in a demure manner.%K%P

0x7C4
While trying to think about what to say...%K%P

0x7FC
... It's at that point that "he" shows up, entering the living%Nroom while rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.%K%P
