―I'm dreaming.%K%N

0xD4
I'm dreaming of a story that runs by quickly in my long,%Ndeep slumber.%K%N%N

0xE0
If I had to liken this to a color, it would be... purple.%K%N

0xEC
The entire world is dyed purple.%K%N%N

0xF8
In the purple world, a child is crying...%K%P

0x10C
It's a lonely girl, who is either in grade school or about to%Nenter grade school.%K%N

0x118
Could she be a lost child?%K%N

0x124
The girl uneasily looks around her, and scrunches up%Nher face as she bursts into tears again.%K%N%N

0x130
Besides the girl is a boy.%K%N

0x13C
He seems to be the same age as the girl.%K%P

0x150
The boy speaks.%K%N%N

0x15C
"You don't recognize this area...?"%K%N%N

0x168
The girl nods, still crying.%K%N%N

0x174
"Then go ask a policeman. He'll definitely show you the%Nway home."%K%N%N

0x180
"*Hic, hic*..."%K%P

0x194
"By the way, what's your name? You haven't told me yet."%K%N%N

0x1A0
"Uwaah, uwaah!"%K%N%N

0x1AC
"I can't understand you if all you do is cry..."%K%N%N

0x1B8
"Waah! Waah!"%K%P

0x1CC
"*Hic*...I wanna go home..."%K%N%N

0x1D8
"I know...!"%K%N%N

0x1E4
The boy searches through his pocket.%K%N

0x1F0
Before long, he takes something small out.%K%P

0x204
"I'll give this to you, so don't cry anymore..."%K%N%N

0x210
He takes the girl's hand...%K%N

0x21C
...And places a small object in her palm.%K%P

0x230
It's... a small key chain.%K%N%N

0x23C
"Well?♪"%K%N%N

0x248
The boy smiles at the girl.%K%N

0x254
The girl looks back and forth between the key chain in%Nher palm and the boy's face.%K%N

0x260
After a little while, the girl stops crying, and smiles.%K%P

0x274
"Thank you..."%K%N%N

0x280
"Yeah. So, what's you name?"%K%N%N

0x28C
The girl wipes the tears off her face, and with an%Nawkward voice, she states her name.%K%N%N

0x298
"My name is ... "%K%P

0x3DC
The refreshing morning light shines in.%K%P

0x3E8
I don't wake up with any of the listlessness I usually feel%Nas soon as I wake up.%K%P

0x3F4
I look at my alarm clock.%K%P

0x400
It's past 8:00...%K%P

0x40C
I definitely went to sleep at about 10:00 last night, so%Nthat means I've slept for...%K%N

0x418
―T-Ten hours?!?%K%P

0x440
I jump to my feet from my bed, and take out a small%Nstanding mirror from my bag.%K%P

0x44C
I look at my face reflected off the mirror.%K%P

0x458
...What a relief.%K%N

0x464
Fortunately, there's no bags under my eyes.%K There's no%Nswelling at all on my face.%K%P

0x470
Yuka「Whew, boy oh boy...」%K%P

0x47C
I sigh, and begin changing my clothes.%K%P

0x488
(Now that I think about it... I had a weird dream...)%K%P

0x494
For some reason, it left quite the impression on me.%K%P

0x4A0
Anxiety...%K That dream was full of anxiety.%K%P

0x4AC
Like the feeling of floating on the water's surface...%K%P

0x4B8
Where it feels like you could fly off into the sky at any%Nminute... that feeling of anxiety...%K%P

0x4C4
(Mmm...)%K%P

0x4D0
(Oh well, whatever.)%K%P

0x4DC
Telling this to myself, I begin to diligently comb my hair.%K%P

0x4E8
After all, today has a good-feeling morning.%K%P

0x4F4
The air outside this morning is so good that it makes me%Nwant to take a large inhale of it right now.%K%P

0x500
When I finish setting my hair, I turn to the right and go out%Nmy door.%K%P

0x5C4
After 9:00, Kurumi-chan arrives with some French toast%Nfor breakfast.%K%N%N

0x5D0
Makoto, Okuhiko-kun, and Haruka awaken a little while%Nlater.%K%N

0x5DC
Once we're all gathered, I announce that today's plan is%Nto play tennis.%K%N%N

0x5E8
Of course, I know that once I announce that, Makoto and%NHaruka will tell us that they're going fishing.%K%P

0x5FC
"The good parts of history must stay good."%K%N%N

0x608
Makoto feels that going fishing with Haruka is a good%Nevent.%K%N

0x614
At the very least, it is for Haruka.%K%N%N

0x620
Deciding to make things more favorable for those two, I%Ntalk to Okuhiko-kun.%K%P

0x690
Yuka「Hey, Okuhiko-kun? Can I ask you a favor?」%K%P

0x6AC
Okuhiko「Hmm? What is it? I'll do whatever you ask, as long as it's%Nwithin my power.」%K%P

0x6B8
He says this, aware of Haruka sitting next to him.%K%P

0x6CC
Yuka「The truth is, I forgot to book the courts for today...」%K%P

0x6E0
Okuhiko「Huh? Really...? But they're usually empty, so shouldn't it%Nbe all right...?」%K%P

0x6EC
Yuka「Yes... But I have a feeling it'll be crowded today.」%K%P

0x6F8
Yuka「You see, I was taking a walk earlier...」%K%P

0x704
Yuka「When I saw a tourist group arrive at a nearby lodge.」%K%P

0x718
Okuhiko「I-Is that right? Hmm... I see.」%K%P

0x72C
Yuka「So won't you go and book it for me...?」%K%P

0x738
Yuka「Oh, but I don't mind if Makoto is the one who does it.」%K%P

0x744
Yuka「Hey, Haruka, which one should I ask?」%K%P

0x760
Haruka「...?」%K%P

0x76C
Haruka「It doesn't really matter to me...」%K%P

0x780
Okuhiko「Hmm...」%K%P

0x78C
Okuhiko-kun gives Haruka's face a sidelong glance...%K%P

0x7A0
Okuhiko「All right, got it. Why don't I go there right now?」%K%P

0x7BC
Yuka「Thank you♪ You've really become reliable, Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0x7D0
Okuhiko「Ha ha ha ha ha. Leave it to me.」%K%P

0x7DC
Okuhiko「Well then, I'm going now, Haruka-chan.」%K%P

0x7F0
Okuhiko-kun sends Haruka a flirtatious glance, then%Ncasually walks out of the lodge.%K%P

0x7FC
Makoto「...W-Well done...」%K%P

0x808
Having watched our exchange, baffled, Makoto finally%Nopens his mouth.%K%P

0x814
I answer Makoto with a wink.%K%P

0x828
Haruka「??」%K%P

0x834
Kurumi「??」%K%P

0x840
Haruka and Kurumi-chan, neither understanding what%Njust happened, tilt their heads.%K%P

0x854
...%K%P

0x868
Saki「Good morning, everyone!」%K%P

0x874
Saki comes in carrying a basket, and things progress%Nthe same way as last time.%K%P

0x90C
Like last time, Saki plans to come with us to tennis.%K%N

0x918
When she hears Makoto and Haruka won't be going to%Nplay tennis, Saki makes a discontent face, but doesn't%Nobject against it.%K%N%N

0x924
No one interferes with Makoto and Haruka as they go to%Nfish.%K%N%N

0x930
And then....%K%P

0x9A0
Okuhiko「Hey, you're slow. I was getting tired of waiting.」%K%P

0x9AC
Okuhiko「Since I was down here, I figured I'd reserve all the courts.」%K%P

0x9B8
Okuhiko「What do you think? With this, absolutely no one can get%Nin our wa-」%K%P

0x9CC
Okuhiko「Wait, huh? I don't see Haruka-chan anywhere...」%K%P

0x9E8
Yuka「Huh? Didn't I tell you?」%K%P

0x9F4
Okuhiko「???」%K%P

0xA00
Yuka「Makoto and Haruka are doing something else.」%K%P

0xA14
Okuhiko「...Huh?」%K%P

0xA28
The dozens of rackets leaning against the bench all fall%Ndown with a dull thud...%K%P

0xAF8
And thus, we begin our game of tennis.%K%N

0xB04
I repeat the exact same match as last time, but because%NI'm so focused on searching for the bell later, I don't%Nenjoy the game all that much.%K%N%N

0xB10
―Noon arrives.%K%N

0xB1C
We eat the sandwiches that Saki made for lunch.%K%N%N

0xB28
...Is it my imagination?%K%N

0xB34
Or are the ingredients in this sandwich different from%Nlast time...?%K%P

0xBB8
After our lunch break, we resume the match.%K%P

0xBC4
In the afternoon, we do pair doubles, with "Yuka-Kurumi"%NVS "Saki-Okuhiko".%K%P

0xBD0
It's such a close match that I don't have the luxury to%Nthink about the bell anymore.%K%P

0xC0C
―Is Saki doing better than last time?%K%P

0xC18
She's really putting her back into the game; her returns%Nto my smashes are powerful.%K%P

0xC24
Now that I think about it, she did have quite the%Ncompetitive spirit back in the day...%K%P

0xC90
Before long, the climatic match ends (of course, with us%Nwinning), and Kurumi-chan and I leave the courts.%K%P

0xC9C
Saki, who lost the match, looks very disappointed... It%Nseems she's going to play for a little while longer and%Ntake a crash course.%K%P

0xCA8
And Okuhiko-kun, who was with her, is now feeling%Nmiserable from his loss.%K%P

0xCB4
Because Okuhiko-kun reserved the entire place, the%Nshower room is naturally empty.%K%P

0xCC0
After that intense match, taking a shower feels like%Nheaven...%K%P

0xCCC
... ... ...%K%P

0xD48
Once Kurumi-chan and I finish changing clothes, we head%Nfor the shopping district.%K%P

0xD54
Right now, the plan is for us to go to the gift shop.%K%P

0xD60
As we descend the hill road, all I can think about is the%Nbell.%K%P

0xD6C
(Will I be able to find it all right...?)%K%P

0xD78
I really am anxious without Makoto here...%K%P

0xDC8
We come out on the coastline, and walk towards the east.%K%P

0xDD4
Moon Beach is a short distance away.%K%P

0xDE0
I can't help but get more and more anxious.%K%P

0xDEC
What if... I can't find the bell...?%K%P

0xDF8
Even if I tried to give Makoto my bell, there's no way he'd%Naccept it...%K%P

0xE04
Then when the 6th comes, Makoto will have no bell.%K%P

0xE10
What if...%K What if an unexpected accident happens?%K What%Nif Makoto's life is put in danger?%K%P

0xE1C
...Then, Makoto will "really" die!%K%P

0xE28
My anxiety is growing more and more.%K%P

0xE34
As we continue, I gaze at the white, crescent shaped%Nsandy beach.%K%P

0xE40
What if someone picks it up before I do?%K No... should I go%Npick it up right now?%K%P

0xE4C
I've thought about this enough.%K%P

0xE58
After all, I'll be changing history considerably.%K%P

0xE64
Right now, should I go and find the bell first...?%K Or should I%Ngo shopping first like in the last history...?%K%P

0xE70
A "fated choice" has arrived before me――.%K

0x50C8
Go shopping first.

0x50D4
Go look for the bell first.

0xEB0
I decide to let history repeat itself in the order it went in%Nlast time.%K%P

0xEBC
Kurumi「Yuka-saaaan!!」%K%P

0xEC8
When I come to my senses, I see that Kurumi is far ahead%Nof me.%K%P

0xED4
I speed up and chase after Kurumi-chan.%K%P

0xF50
We arrive at the shopping district about the same time%Nas we did last time.%K%P

0xF5C
And also like last time, we have fun shopping.%K%P

0xF68
...%K%P

0xF74
Even though it's my second time, I still buy a large%Namount of stuff.%K%P

0xF80
Right now, I've finished paying at the counter, with a%Nlarge sake bottle I'm carrying in both my hands being%Nplaced into a paper bag.%K%P

0xF8C
I plan to have it shipped back home via delivery service.%K%P

0xF98
Kurumi-chan is now at the counter, buying something.%K%P

0xFA4
While waiting for Kurumi-chan, I decide look around the%Nshop's interior one more time.%K%P

0xFB0
Suddenly, my eye is caught by countless key chains%Ndangling down from a nearby shelf.%K%P

0xFBC
(Oh, that's right...!)%K%P

0xFC8
This is where I bought that key chain last time.%K I didn't%Nbuy it for anyone else. It was a souvenir for me.%K%P

0xFD4
I approach the group of key chains as if they're luring%Nme in.%K%P

0xFE0
And then, in order to find my target, I check every single%None of the key chains.%K%P

0xFEC
...%K%P

0xFF8
(F-Found it...!)%K%P

0x100C
It's there that I see the key chain with the fat cat mascot%Nattached to it dangling downwards.%K%P

0x1018
I play around with the cat for a short time in my hand as%Nfeelings of nostalgia flood within me.%K%P

0x1024
In the last loop, I traded the key chain for the bell.%K%P

0x1030
Why do I find this key chain so captivating...?%K%P

0x103C
(...That's right. I thought that it resembled something...)%K%P

0x1048
(But what...?)%K%P

0x1064
Kurumi「Thanks for waiting♪ We bought so much that they gave%NKurumi some postage stamps for free♪」%K%P

0x1078
Kurumi「...?? Is something wrong, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x1094
Yuka「Huh? Ah, I just thought that this was cute♪」%K%P

0x10A8
Kurumi「Wow, it looks like the spitting image of a cat in a manga%NKurumi read.」%K%P

0x10BC
Kurumi「It's name was Schr▼dy.」%K%P

0x10D0
(A cat in a manga, huh...?)%K%P

0x10E4
(...Yeah, that might be it.)%K%P

0x10F8
Yuka「All right, I'm gonna buy this♪」%K%P

0x110C
Yuka「Excuse me, I'll take this!」%K%P

0x1118
Of course, I intend to give this cat my own name...%K%P

0x1124
An incredible name that can only come from my refined%Nnaming sense.%K%P

0x1130
(Nice to meet you, Nin Nin Neko Pyon #2♪)%K%P

0x11C8
The white, sandy beach curved in the shape of a bow is%Nspread out before my eyes.%K%P

0x11D4
Or rather, the shore is more like the shape of a crescent%Nmoon...%K%P

0x11E0
It's as if the beach was carefully carved into its shape%Nby the waves, like it was a wood sculpture.%K%P

0x11EC
Right now, I'm looking for the bell that should be washed%Nup around here.%K%P

0x11F8
I see Kurumi a bit farther away from me.%K%P

0x1204
In the end, I decided to get her help.%K%P

0x1210
I lied to her, telling her that "I dropped a memento of my%Ngrandpa here."%K%P

0x121C
This way, I think she'll certainly find it...%K%P

0x1228
If I just do that much, I don't think it'll cause a big change%Nto history...%K%P

0x1234
I'm certain of it.%K%P

0x1240
I'm certain that "We'll definitely find the bell"...%K%P

0x124C
Before long...%K%P

0x1280
Kurumi「Found it!!」%K%P

0x12A4
Kurumi「Found it! Hey, Kurumi found it, Yuka-san♪」%K%P

0x12B0
She's holding something in her hand.%K%P

0x12BC
Said object shines in the sunlight.%K%P

0x12C8
...It's the bell.%K%P

0x12F0
Kurumi「Hey? Is this it? This is it, right, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x130C
Yuka「Yep! This is it, Kurumi-chan!!」%K%P

0x1320
Kurumi「Really!? Yay, what a relief♪ Kurumi worked as hard as%Nshe could to find it!」%K%P

0x132C
In Kurumi-chan's other hand, she holds two bent tree%Nbranches.%K%P

0x1338
However, I have absolutely no clue how they could%Npossibly be used to search for something.%K%P

0x1344
Yuka「Yes, yes... You're a good girl, Kurumi-chan～♪」%K%P

0x1350
As a reward, I gently pat Kurumi-chan on the head.%K%P

0x1364
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x1378
I accept the bell from Kurumi.%K%P

0x13AC
The bell lands in my palm, making a high pitched sound.%K%P

0x13C8
I decide to search for the bell first.%K%P

0x13DC
Yuka「Hey, Kurumi-chan?」%K%P

0x13F8
Kurumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x1404
Yuka「Umm... why don't you go shopping alone?」%K%P

0x1418
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x1424
Yuka「Um... I remembered that there's something important I%Nhave to do...」%K%P

0x1430
Kurumi「Something important?」%K%P

0x143C
Yuka「Err... um...」%K%P

0x1448
Kurumi「?」%K%P

0x145C
Yuka「I have to go look... for something I dropped.」%K%P

0x1470
Kurumi「Something you dropped?」%K%P

0x147C
Yuka「Yeah...」%K%P

0x1488
Kurumi「What was it?」%K%P

0x1494
Yuka「Th-That's...」%K%P

0x14A8
Kurumi-chan looks at me with an curious gaze that%Nscreams "What is it, what is it?"%K%P

0x14B4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x14C0
Yuka「...It's a memento.」%K%P

0x14D4
Kurumi「A-A memento!? O-Of who?」%K%P

0x14E0
Yuka「...M-My great grandfather...」%K%P

0x14EC
...That's a lie.%K%P

0x14F8
My great grandfather is still alive in the countryside,%Nlively as ever.%K%P

0x1504
Hell, he's even over a 100 years old...%K%P

0x1518
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x1524
(Did she see... through my lie...!?)%K%P

0x1540
Kurumi「...Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x154C
Yuka「Wh-What...?」%K%P

0x1558
Kurumi「...Let Kurumi help.」%K%P

0x156C
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x159C
Kurumi「Kurumi's saying she'll help you out♪」%K%P

0x15A8
Kurumi「Because if it's something that important, then you%Nabsolutely need to find it!」%K%P

0x15BC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x15D0
Kurumi「Isn't that right? Right?♪」%K%P

0x15DC
Yuka「...Y-Yeah.」%K%P

0x15F0
In the end, Kurumi-chan helps me look for the bell.%K%P

0x15FC
(...Hey, is this really all right...??)%K%P

0x1608
I mutter these words in my mind as I turn towards the%Ndirection of the harbor.%K%P

0x166C
And thus, the search for the bell begins.%K%P

0x1678
I walk along the beach, relying on my vague memories.%K%P

0x1684
My eyes are as wide as saucers as I scan the beach.%K%P

0x1690
Shells and seaweed are washed ashore by the waves,%Nonly to be dragged back in.%K%P

0x169C
Occasionally, I'll carefully excavate something buried in%Nthe sand.%K%P

0x16A8
...The steady search continues to go on and on for%Nnearly an hour.%K%P

0x16C0
... ... ...%K%P

0x173C
I can't find the bell...%K%P

0x1748
We've searched so much, but we can't find it.%K%P

0x1754
Has history really changed after all?%K%P

0x1760
Did someone else pick it up...?%K%P

0x176C
Or is it still at the bottom of the sea...?%K%P

0x1778
Bad thoughts flood my head, leaving me with no room to%Nthink of anything else...%K%P

0x178C
Yuka「Haah～...」%K%P

0x1798
I let out an involuntary sigh, and stretch myself out, my%Nback tired from being bent this whole time.%K%P

0x17A4
I look around in an attempt to ignore my feelings.%K%P

0x17B8
A short distance away from me, Kurumi-chan slowly%Npaces around while holding two bent tree branches in%Nher hands.%K%P

0x17C4
...?%K%P

0x17D0
Could it be... that she's trying to use dowsing??%K%P

0x17DC
Hmm...%K%P

0x17E8
But I don't think there's any meaning... in using tree%Nbranches...%K%P

0x17F4
...Even so, Kurumi-chan is desperately searching.%K%P

0x1800
Gradually, I feel my chest grow hotter and hotter.%K%P

0x180C
She's doing everything she can to search for it...%K Even%Nthough it's something someone else dropped...%K%P

0x1818
Inspired by her actions, I resume my search once again.%K%P

0x1824
...%K%P

0x1830
...Now that I think about it...%K%P

0x183C
Now that I think about it, I feel like this happened in the%Npast.%K%P

0x1848
I was... searching for something very, very important...%K%P

0x1854
That's right. At that time, I was also looking for something%Nvery important.%K%P

0x1860
(At that time... umm...)%K%P

0x186C
(What was I looking for...?)%K%P

0x1878
...I can't remember.%K%P

0x1884
It feels like a rising bubble that stops just before it can%Nreach the water's surface.%K%P

0x1890
It's a memory of mine, but I barely remember anything...%K%P

0x189C
However, there are two things alone that I clearly%Nremember.%K%P

0x18A8
#1: That object was something I considered to be a%Ntreasure.%K%P

0x18B4
#2: In the end, I never found it.%K%P

0x18C0
A slightly cold wind blows by.%K%P

0x18DC
...And, at that time!%K%P

0x18E8
Kurumi「Foooound it!!」%K%P

0x18F4
Yuka「What!?」%K%P

0x1908
Kurumi「Found it! Hey, Kurumi found it, Yuka-san♪」%K%P

0x1914
Kurumi-chan runs over to me, one of her hands%Nstretched out.%K%P

0x1920
She's holding something in that hand.%K%P

0x192C
Said object shines in the sunlight.%K%P

0x1938
...It's the bell.%K%P

0x1944
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x196C
Kurumi「Hey? Is this it? This is it, right, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x1988
Yuka「...This is it.」%K%P

0x1994
Yuka「This is it! This is it, Kurumi-chan!!」%K%P

0x19A8
Kurumi「Really!? Yay, what a relief♪ Kurumi worked as hard as%Nshe could to find it!」%K%P

0x19B4
Yuka「Yes, yes... You're a good girl, Kurumi-chan～♪」%K%P

0x19C0
I gently pat Kurumi-chan on the head.%K%P

0x19D4
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x19E0
I take the bell from Kurumi-chan.%K%P

0x1A14
The bell lands in my palm, making a high pitched sound.%K%P

0x1A20
Yuka「With this, I can save...」%K%P

0x1A34
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x1A48
Yuka「Hmm? ...Ah-」%K%P

0x1A54
Crap...%K%P

0x1A60
Kurumi「...If you didn't find that memento, you wouldn't be able to%Nsave someone? From what? Death?」%K%P

0x1A74
Yuka「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x1A88
Kurumi「Who?」%K%P

0x1A94
Yuka「Th-That's...」%K%P

0x1AA8
Kurumi-chan looks at me with an inquisitive gaze that%Nscreams "Who is it, who is it?"%K%P

0x1AB4
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1AC0
Yuka「...My great-grandma.」%K%P

0x1AD4
...That's a lie.%K%P

0x1AE0
My great-grandma died three years ago...%K%P

0x1B5C
Makoto「How's it going, Yuka? Did you find it?」%K%P

0x1B68
A little while later, Makoto comes to Moon Beach.%K%P

0x1B74
He told Haruka he had an errand to run, and left%Ntemporarily.%K%P

0x1B80
Despite what he said, I guess he was worried after all.%K%P

0x1B8C
To have Makoto be that concerned for me is kinda%Nembarrassing, but I can't help but crack a smile.%K%P

0x1BA0
Yuka「Heh heh heh heh heh...」%K%P

0x1BAC
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x1BC0
Yuka「Ta-da♪」%K%P

0x1BCC
I proudly show him the bell in my palm.%K%P

0x1BD8
Makoto「Phew... this makes two lifel...」%K%P

0x1BE4
As he tries to say this, Makoto notices Kurumi, and is%Ntaken aback.%K%P

0x1BF0
(...Hmm? Oh, that's right...)%K%P

0x1C04
Yuka「Kurumi-chan also helped out.」%K%P

0x1C10
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x1C2C
Kurumi「Yuka-san said it was a memento of her great-grandpa,%Nso...」%K%P

0x1C38
Kurumi「Kurumi looked very hard for it.」%K%P

0x1C44
Makoto「Were you the one to find it, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x1C58
Kurumi「Yep♪」%K%P

0x1C64
Makoto「I see. You're a good girl...」%K%P

0x1C70
Makoto pats Kurumi-chan on the head.%K%P

0x1C84
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x1C90
Makoto「Well then, I've got to go back now.」%K%P

0x1C9C
Yuka「Right.」%K%P

0x1CA8
Makoto「See you later...」%K%P

0x1CBC
Makoto turns around.%K%P

0x1CC8
Without a moment's delay, I immediately draw close to%NMakoto.%K%P

0x1CDC
Yuka「Here...」%K%P

0x1CE8
I whisper this very faintly into Makoto's ear, and place%Nthe bell in his palm.%K%P

0x1CF4
From the way I'm standing, my back acts as a wall so that%NKurumi-chan can't see us.%K%P

0x1D08
Yuka「This is yours... right?」%K%P

0x1D1C
I say this, and lightly tap Makoto on his shoulder.%K%P

0x1D28
With this, there's no longer anything to worry about...%K%P

0x1D34
Kurumi「Hold on, you two... What are you doing?」%K%P

0x1D40
The sound of her voice makes me jump, and I move away%Nfrom Makoto.%K%P

0x1D54
Yuka「Nothing really. It's nothing, it's nothing.」%K%P

0x1D60
Kurumi「It not nothing, is it? What you did just now was too%Nsuspicious!」%K%P

0x1D74
Yuka「You think so～?」%K%P

0x1D88
Kurumi「Of course!」%K%P

0x1D94
Kurumi scrutinizingly glares at us while furrowing her brow.%K%P

0x1DA0
Makoto「Well then, see you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x1DAC
Makoto departs, running away as fast as he can.%K%P

0x1DC0
Kurumi「Ah! Wait a minute, Onii-chan!」%K%P

0x1E4C
After Makoto leaves, Kurumi-chan and I head towards%Nthe gift shop in the shopping district.%K%P

0x1E58
We arrive much later than the last time.%K%P

0x1E64
Nevertheless, we have fun shopping, just like last time.%K%P

0x1E70
...%K%P

0x1E7C
Even though it's my second time, I still buy a large%Namount of stuff.%K%P

0x1E88
Right now, I've finished paying at the counter, with a%Nlarge sake bottle I'm carrying in both my hands being%Nplaced into a paper bag.%K%P

0x1E94
I plan to have it shipped back home via delivery service.%K%P

0x1EA0
Kurumi-chan is now at the counter, buying something.%K%P

0x1EAC
While waiting for Kurumi-chan, I decide look around the%Nshop's interior one more time.%K%P

0x1EB8
Suddenly, my eye is caught by countless key chains%Ndangling down from a nearby shelf.%K%P

0x1EC4
(Oh, that's right...!)%K%P

0x1ED0
This is where I bought that key chain last time.%K I didn't%Nbuy it for anyone else. It was a souvenir for me.%K%P

0x1EDC
I approach the group of key chains as if they're luring%Nme in.%K%P

0x1EE8
And then, in order to find my target, I check every single%None of the key chains.%K%P

0x1F10
...%K%P

0x1F1C
(H-Huh...? Whaaaaat?)%K%P

0x1F28
But the key chain I bought back then isn't there.%K%P

0x1F34
(Is this the wrong shop...?)%K%P

0x1F40
(No... that's not it. It was definitely this one.)%K%P

0x1F4C
I might have overlooked it.%K%P

0x1F58
I look for it one more time.%K%P

0x1F64
...But I can't find it, no matter how many times I look.%K%P

0x1F70
The key chain with the fat cat mascot attached to it...%K I%Ncan't find Nin Nin Neko Pyon...%K%P

0x1F84
Yuka「Um, excuse me?」%K%P

0x1F90
Yuka「Do you have a key chain with a fat cat mascot attached%Nto it here?」%K%P

0x1F9C
I ask a passing store clerk.%K%P

0x1FA8
There's no way that they'll know what I'm talking about.%K%P

0x1FB4
Even so, it doesn't hurt to ask.%K%P

0x1FC0
Clerk「Huh? ...Oh, that key chain?」%K%P

0x1FD4
Yuka「!?」%K%P

0x1FE0
Yuka「...Th-That's it. That's definitely it. Where is this it?」%K%P

0x1FEC
Clerk「We're sold out.」%K%P

0x1FF8
...!!%K%P

0x2004
Yuka「...S-Sold out?」%K%P

0x2010
Clerk「It's kind of a rare key chain, you see.」%K%P

0x201C
Clerk「If it's not there... then that means we've run out of stock.」%K%P

0x2030
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x204C
Kurumi「Thanks for waiting♪ We bought so much that they gave%NKurumi some postage stamps for free♪」%K%P

0x2060
Kurumi「...?? What's wrong, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x2074
...%K%P

0x2080
With all our business concluded, we leave the shop...%K%P

0x20EC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x20F8
I walk with my shoulders slumped, heartbroken.%K%P

0x2104
Kurumi-chan is at my side, clearly worried about me.%K%P

0x2110
I feel depressed, as if there's a gaping wide hole in my%Nheart... It's a tormenting feeling of loss.%K%P

0x211C
It's probably because... of that key chain...%K%P

0x2130
Kurumi「Hey, what's wrong...?」%K%P

0x213C
Kurumi「You've been totally down since the gift shop.」%K%P

0x2158
Yuka「That's... not true...」%K%P

0x216C
Kurumi「Yes it is... Kurumi's never seen you look this depressed%Nbefore...」%K%P

0x2178
Kurumi「It's about the same as you were on Moon Beach, when%Nyou were looking for that lost object of yours.」%K%P

0x219C
(...!?)%K%P

0x21A8
Lost object...%K%P

0x21B4
An important thing that I couldn't find...%K%P

0x21C0
My lost... treasure...%K%P

0x21CC
The bubble finally reaches the top of the water, the%Nsleeping memory within me having been revived.%K%P

0x21D8
(That's it...!)%K%P

0x21E4
(That's why I wanted that key chain so much...)%K%P

0x2250
We go out onto the paved road.%K%P

0x225C
While doing so, we walk while talking about trivial things.%K%P

0x2270
Kurumi「And then, you see, Onee-chan...」%K%P

0x2284
Kurumi-chan laughs loudly.%K%P

0x2290
She's having fun laughing at this random story.%K%P

0x229C
But I still can't laugh like Kurumi-chan.%K%P

0x22A8
Because I remembered...%K%P

0x22B4
Because I came to this Seminar Camp, I remembered too%Nmuch of my past.%K%P

0x22C0
One by one...%K One by one...%K%P

0x22CC
Back then, in that memory, I had talked to someone.%K%P

0x22D8
I was sad, unstable, and felt like I had been abandoned.%K%P

0x22EC
Kurumi「Hey, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x2308
Yuka「Hmm? What is it?」%K%P

0x231C
Kurumi「That key chain that was sold out... Was it really that%Nspecial?」%K%P

0x233C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2348
Kurumi「Because ever since then, you've been acting really%Nweird.」%K%P

0x2354
I stop walking.%K%P

0x2360
Kurumi-chan comes to a halt.%K%P

0x237C
For a little while, I'm a bit hesitant about whether or not I%Nshould talk about it...%K%P

0x2388
Yuka「...That key chain was...」%K%P

0x2394
...But then I make up my mind to tell her.%K%P

0x23A0
Yuka「That key chain was...」%K%P

0x23AC
Yuka「...kinda the spitting image...」%K%P

0x23B8
Yuka「...of an important treasure from when I was young...」%K%P

0x23C4
Yuka「A small cat key chain...」%K%P

0x23D0
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x23DC
Yuka「The cat on the key chain... was called 'Nin Nin Neko Pyon'...」%K%P

0x23E8
Yuka「Even though it was small, it wasn't cute at all...」%K%P

0x23F4
Yuka「It had this scratch on its forehead shaped like a cross%Nor a shuriken, and it was pretty ugly.」%K%P

0x2400
Yuka「No, that scratch was exactly like a shuriken...」%K%P

0x2414
Kurumi「S-So you mean... the 'Nin Nin' part of it's name came from%N'ninja'...?」%K%P

0x2428
Yuka「That's right.」%K%P

0x243C
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x2448
Yuka「That cat key chain wasn't cute in the slightest, but...」%K%P

0x2454
Yuka「...It was a precious treasure to me.」%K%P

0x2484
Yuka「It was a very, very important treasure that I received%Nfrom a special person...」%K%P

0x2490
Yuka「I attached it to my backpack, and would go to school%Nwith it.」%K%P

0x24A4
Yuka「But then...」%K%P

0x24B0
Yuka「But then... one day, I lost it.」%K%P

0x24C4
Kurumi「Huh...?」%K%P

0x24D0
Yuka「In the past... when I was in first grade in elementary%Nschool, I had no sense of direction, so I would frequently%Nget lost.」%K%P

0x24DC
Yuka「That day, I was lost too.」%K%P

0x24E8
Yuka「I was returning from school, and I hurried on home, as%Nthere was a TV show I really wanted to see that I had to%Nmake it in time for...」%K%P

0x24F4
Yuka「But when it seemed like I wouldn't make it in time... I thought%Nto use a shortcut. It was a shortcut my friend told me%Nabout the previous day.」%K%P

0x2500
Yuka「But I didn't recognize that street at all, so before I knew%Nit, I had wandered astray.」%K%P

0x250C
Yuka「...I was an idiot. I guess you could say I didn't know my%Nlimits...」%K%P

0x2518
Yuka「In the end, I got lost, and forgot all about the TV show...」%K%P

0x2524
Yuka「I continued to wander around these unknown places%Nwhile crying like a baby.」%K%P

0x2530
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x253C
Yuka「I came to my senses... and before I knew it, I was%Nstanding in front of my house.」%K%P

0x2548
Yuka「And then... suddenly, I looked at my backpack...」%K%P

0x2554
Kurumi「And the kitty key chain was gone...?」%K%P

0x2560
Yuka「Yeah...」%K%P

0x256C
Yuka「I must have dropped it while I was lost...」%K%P

0x2578
Yuka「When I was wandering through the back alleys, my%Nbackpack rubbed against the walls, which is most likely%Nwhen it happened.」%K%P

0x2584
Yuka「But at that time, I didn't suspect that the cat didn't come%Nall the way home with me.」%K%P

0x2598
Kurumi「Did you look for it after that?」%K%P

0x25AC
Yuka「Of course I did.」%K%P

0x25B8
Yuka「The next day, I brought along a friend who knew that%Nshortcut well...」%K%P

0x25C4
Yuka「For hours and hours, we searched the area until it%Nbecame pitch black outside.」%K%P

0x25D8
Yuka「But... we didn't find it.」%K%P

0x25E4
Yuka「When the time came for me to go home, I had lost that%Nsmall cat.」%K%P

0x25F0
Yuka「And now... I've lost it again.」%K%P

0x25FC
Yuka「That store clerk said they had that fat cat key chain,%Nbut...」%K%P

0x2608
(And once again, I lost it as a result of the bell...)%K%P

0x2614
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x2628
Kurumi「...H-Huh?」%K%P

0x263C
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x2648
Kurumi「Didn't you say earlier that 'those two key chains were%Nthe spitting image of each other'?」%K%P

0x2654
Yuka「Yeah, I did.」%K%P

0x2660
Kurumi「But...」%K%P

0x266C
Kurumi「But the first one was a small kitty, and the second one%Nwas a fat kitty, so they don't resemble each other at all,%Ndo they??」%K%P

0x2680
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x268C
Yuka「When you put it that way... that's true.」%K%P

0x2698
Kurumi「'Th-That's true'?」%K%P

0x26AC
Yuka「But... they're simliar!」%K%P

0x26B8
Yuka「When I first saw it, I definitely thought that they%Nresembled each other!」%K%P

0x26CC
Yuka「Even if their appearances are different...」%K%P

0x26E0
Kurumi「...Yuka... san?」%K%P

0x26EC
(...That's right.)%K%P

0x26F8
(Even though they don't look alike... they're still spitting%Nimages.)%K%P

0x27B8
After Makoto leaves, Kurumi-chan and I stay at Moon%NBeach, gazing at the setting sun as we start to leave.%K%P

0x27C4
No matter how many times I see this sight, it always%Nleaves a wonderful feeling in my heart...%K%P

0x27D0
The two of us continue to stare in a daze as if our souls%Nhave drifted out of our bodies, and when we come to our%Nsenses, we realize we've been there for at least an hour.%K%P

0x27DC
When we return to the lodge, the hands on the clock%Nindicate that it's 6:00 P.M.%K%P

0x286C
I sit down on the living room sofa, and let my thoughts%Nwander.%K%P

0x2888
I think it took us 15 minutes to arrive at the lodge.%K%P

0x2894
Just as predicted, Saki and Haruka's quarrel never%Nhappens...%K%P

0x28A0
While Izumi-san is making dinner in the kitchen, everyone%Npasses the time as they please.%K%P

0x28AC
Haruka is sitting next to me, watching TV, while Saki%Nstands by the window as she looks outside.%K%P

0x28B8
Kurumi-chan is sitting on the floor, in the middle of folding%Nsome origami.%K%P

0x28C4
Okuhiko-kun is lying in the loft, with an ice pack on his%Nface.%K It seems that Makoto punched him...%K%P

0x28D0
Makoto is in the dining room, humming while setting the%Ntable.%K%P

0x28DC
The song he's humming is a recent and popular one.%K%P

0x28E8
But he's completely off-key, and so I desperately try to%Nhold back my laughter...%K%P

0x28F4
He's painfully tone-deaf.%K%P

0x2910
Looking at this very peaceful scene causes the shock%Nof losing the key chain to fade a little...%K%P

0x291C
I casually walk over to the dining room.%K%P

0x2964
Makoto「Hmm hmm hmm♪ Hmm hmhmm♪ Hmm hmmhmm hm hmmmm♪」%K%P

0x2970
Makoto is taking out the plates and silverware, lining%Nthem up on the table.%K%P

0x297C
I watch him do this.%K%P

0x2988
I don't say a word to him. All I do... is silently watch him.%K%P

0x2994
Makoto「Hmm? What is it, Yuka?」%K%P

0x29A8
Yuka「...Huh? No, umm...」%K%P

0x29B4
Makoto「Don't tell me... you're THAT persistent on wanting to help%Nout with the cooking again?」%K%P

0x29C8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x29D4
Makoto「That won't work. I tried offering my assistance to%NIzumi-san as well, but she refused me.」%K%P

0x29E0
Makoto「...Huh? Am I wrong?」%K%P

0x29EC
Yuka「...Yes, you are...」%K%P

0x29F8
Makoto「Then what is it?」%K%P

0x2A04
Yuka「Umm, err...」%K%P

0x2A10
Makoto「??」%K%P

0x2A1C
Yuka「I wanted... to talk for a bit...」%K%P

0x2A28
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2A34
Makoto looks back and forth between the kitchen, living%Nroom.%K%P

0x2A40
Fortunately, no one is coming.%K%P

0x2A4C
Makoto「...What's wrong? Are you worried about something?」%K%P

0x2A58
Yuka「...Th-That's not it...」%K%P

0x2A64
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2A94
Makoto quietly walks over to me.%K%P

0x2AA0
Then he gently strokes my hair.%K%P

0x2AAC
I lose the ability to move, as if I've suddenly come down%Nwith sleep paralysis.%K%P

0x2AB8
Nevertheless, I feel shivers repeatedly running inside%Nmy body.%K%P

0x2AC4
Right now, I feel both relief and anxiety.%K%P

0x2AD0
Is it because of how well everything's been going so%Nfar...?%K%P

0x2AE4
Yuka「...I'm ...uneasy...」%K%P

0x2AF0
I finally let those two words out...%K%P

0x2AFC
Makoto touches my hair again, and slowly strokes it.%K%P

0x2B08
Makoto「...Don't worry.」%K%P

0x2B14
Makoto「I'll take care of everything...」%K%P

0x2B20
Makoto「So it's all right... if you don't do anything...」%K%P

0x2B2C
Makoto「You don't have to worry anymore...」%K%P

0x2B40
Makoto's hand goes from my hair to my cheek...%K%P

0x2B4C
Yuka「...Yes...」%K%P

0x2B58
I am embraced by nearly endless kindness...%K I can't help%Nbut feel... a great sensation of generosity...%K%P

0x2B64
I don't want to forget these feelings, or this warmth.%K%P

0x2B70
Just like that, I bury my face in Makoto's chest ...%K%P

0x2B8C
Saki「...Yuka? Hey, where are you, Yuka?」%K%P

0x2BA0
Yuka「!!!!」%K%P

0x2BAC
Makoto「!!!!」%K%P

0x2BC0
We reflexively separate ourselves from each other.%K%P

0x2BF0
Saki「Ah, there you are... Geez, I was wondering just where you%Nwent...」%K%P

0x2C04
Saki「What is this, a date?」%K%P

0x2C10
Makoto「Y... You're wrong...! Yuka said she had free time, so... umm...」%K%P

0x2C1C
Makoto「That's right! She just said she'd help me carry the%Ndishes.」%K%P

0x2C38
Yuka「Right, right, right... right, right!」%K%P

0x2C4C
Saki「Hmm...」%K%P

0x2C58
Saki「Well, whatever. Anyway, can I talk to you for a bit, Yuka?」%K%P

0x2C6C
Yuka「...Huh? Me?」%K%P

0x2C78
Saki slowly nods.%K%P

0x2C84
She looks like the way she did last night.%K%P

0x2C90
(Hmm... I wonder what she wants to talk about...?)%K%P

0x2D0C
We go outside the lodge.%K%P

0x2D18
It seems it's a conversation that "she doesn't want%Nanyone to hear."%K%P

0x2D24
Our surroundings are completely dark, and I can't even%Nsee down the tip of the hill road right now.%K%P

0x2D30
The scenery has changed with the night―.%K%P

0x2D3C
I know these words well from the time when I frequently%Ngot lost as a kid.%K%P

0x2D48
Surrounding the lodge are the thick trees.%K%P

0x2D54
The contours of those cedar trees are revealed by the%Nlight coming from the moon.%K%P

0x2D60
Saki has been looking at the moon the whole time we've%Nbeen out here.%K%P

0x2D6C
Finally, while still staring at the moon, Saki speaks.%K%P

0x2D80
Saki「Yuka...? You've realized it, right? About Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x2D9C
Yuka「...Huh?」%K%P

0x2DB0
Saki「Makoto-kun... resembles... him.」%K%P

0x2DBC
Saki「That boy... who was in the same class as us in 9th grade...」%K%P

0x2DD0
Yuka「...!!!」%K%P

0x2DE4
Saki「You probably think that too, don't you...?」%K%P

0x2DF0
Saki firmly stares at me.%K%P

0x2E04
Yuka「I-I...」%K%P

0x2E10
Yuka「I... have no clue what you-」%K%P

0x2E24
Saki「Liar!」%K%P

0x2E30
Saki「You're lying.」%K%P

0x2E44
Yuka「Wh-Why do you say that...?」%K%P

0x2E50
Saki「Because you didn't look at me in the eye.」%K%P

0x2E5C
Saki「I know full well that you avoid looking into people's eyes%Nwhen you're lying.」%K%P

0x2E70
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2E84
Saki「If I've realized it, then you've definitely noticed it as well.」%K%P

0x2E90
Saki「Because... you loved that boy...」%K%P

0x2E9C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2EB0
Saki「I noticed it too... but at the start, I was dubious...」%K%P

0x2EBC
Saki「Every time I talked to Makoto-kun, I kept thinking 'there's%Nno mistaking it'.」%K%P

0x2EC8
Saki「The trigger to all of this was that dispute at Lunabeach.」%K%P

0x2ED4
Saki「When we quarreled about the pizza incident...」%K%P

0x2EE0
Saki「In middle school, I got into a quarrel with that boy...」%K%P

0x2EEC
Saki「You remember it too, don't you, Yuka...?」%K%P

0x2EF8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x2F0C
Saki「And then that boy said...」%K%P

0x2F18
Saki「'You should loosen up more. That tiresome way of life%Ndoesn't suit you'...」%K%P

0x2F24
Saki「And then... Makoto-kun said the same thing...」%K%P

0x2F30
Saki「When that happened, I thought 'there's only one other%Nperson in the world who talked to me like that'...」%K%P

0x2F3C
(...Now that she mentions it, I do have a vague memory of%Nit...)%K%P

0x2F48
Saki「I then started to want to know just how much Makoto-kun%Nresembled him...」%K%P

0x2F88
Yuka「...It can't be... that that's why you went out shopping with%Nhim...?」%K%P

0x2F94
Yuka「Back then, did you fall... on purpose?」%K%P

0x2FA8
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2FB4
Saki「At first, I didn't plan that. I was just interested in%NMakoto-kun... Oh, I don't mean in a romantic way or%Nanything like that.」%K%P

0x2FC0
Saki「But on the way back, we had a little accident...」%K%P

0x300C
Saki「I'm not very good with speedy vehicles... particularly%Nbicycles...」%K%P

0x3018
Saki「When Makoto-kun saw how scared I was, he thought it'd%Nbe funny if he went fast...」%K%P

0x3024
Saki「Pretty nasty thing for him to do, in hindsight...」%K%P

0x3030
Saki「But anyway... I had no clue what happened next...」%K%P

0x303C
Saki「When I came to, I was holding down Makoto-kun's face... it%Nseems I was blocking his eyes...」%K%P

0x3048
Yuka「...And so Makoto lost control of the bike, and it fell...?」%K%P

0x3088
Saki「Right. The bike was completely messed up, but%Nfortunately, our injuries weren't major.」%K%P

0x3094
Saki「It occured me that I could use this opportunity to get to%Nknow more about Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x30A0
Yuka「So that's why... you pretended your foot was hurt...?」%K%P

0x30AC
Saki「That's right...」%K%P

0x30C8
Saki「A girl who couldn't move, or the heavy shopping bags...」%K%P

0x30D4
Saki「I wanted to see how he'd cope with the situation and%Nwhich one he would pick in a situation like that...」%K%P

0x30E0
Saki「Well, if he was a normal guy, he'd have put priority over%Nthe girl.」%K%P

0x30EC
Yuka「But... at that time, everyone was at Lunabeach, waiting%Nfor the rice to arrive...」%K%P

0x30F8
Saki「Right...」%K%P

0x3104
Saki「And then... I got worried after that, asking Makoto-kun%Nwhat the hell he was thinking...」%K%P

0x3118
Saki「'It's only common sense'.」%K%P

0x3124
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3130
Saki「And that... was his answer...」%K%P

0x3144
Saki「There's no doubting it... Makoto-kun is exactly like that%Nboy...」%K%P

0x3150
Saki「You're the one who should know that the best, Yuka.」%K%P

0x315C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3168
Saki「Since then, I've paid close attention to Makoto-kun's%Nwords and actions.」%K%P

0x3174
Saki「And I've grown more and more convinced.」%K%P

0x3180
Saki「His casual way of talking and his gestures are spot on.」%K%P

0x318C
Yuka「But... But his face and voice don't resemble him at all...」%K%P

0x3198
Saki「A 'spitting image' who doesn't look like the other... The%Ndefinition of a 'spitting image' is an unrelated stranger%Nwith an accidental, lifelike resemblance of someone else...」%K%P

0x31A4
Saki「The words of this theory don't really matter in this case...」%K%P

0x31B0
Saki「Just the most important part, which is 'an unmistakable%Nresemblance'.」%K%P

0x31BC
Saki「Those two are just too much alike...」%K%P

0x31C8
Saki「...Yes... it's like they're twins.」%K%P

0x31D4
(Twins...)%K%P

0x31E0
Saki「Hey, Yuka? Let me change the topic slightly...」%K%P

0x31EC
Saki「Are you... over him? That boy, I mean...」%K%P

0x31F8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3214
Yuka「...I'm fine now... I've already forgotten a lot about him...」%K%P

0x3220
(What a liar I am...)%K%P

0x322C
(I haven't forgotten him at all...)%K%P

0x3238
(Even now... I still remember... everything about him...)%K%P

0x3244
Yuka「I'm ...fine now...」%K%P

0x3250
(That's... definitely all I want to think about...!)%K%P

0x325C
Saki「I see...」%K%P

0x3270
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3284
Saki「I'm relieved to hear that.」%K%P

0x3290
Saki「Now I can confirm it for myself without the need to%Nhesitate...」%K%P

0x329C
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x32A8
Yuka「...Wh-What do you mean...?」%K%P

0x32BC
Saki「...」%K%P

0x32C8
Saki says nothing, and turns around.%K%P

0x32D4
She walks away, leaving behind wisps of a sweet aroma.%K%P

0x32E0
I know that I've sniffed that aroma before...%K%P

0x32EC
I stand stock still, unable to understand Saki's words.%K%P

0x32F8
Saki「Ah... that's right...」%K%P

0x3304
Saki says this in front of the lodge's staircase without%Nturning around.%K%P

0x3310
Saki「I forgot to say this...」%K%P

0x331C
Saki「I also...」%K%P

0x3338
Saki「I also... loved that boy...」%K%P

0x33AC
Like last time, Izumi-san has made curry for dinner.%K%P

0x33B8
Unfortunately, the food has no flavor to me.%K%P

0x33C4
Saki's words are running around and around in my head%Nover and over again...%K%P

0x33D0
I continue to think about the meaning of those words, not%Neating a bite...%K%P

0x33DC
"Makoto-kun is exactly like that boy."%K%P

0x33E8
"Are you... over him? That boy, I mean..."%K%P

0x33F4
Why did she need to ask me that?%K%P

0x3400
Saki has nothing to gain from that...%K%P

0x340C
"Now I can confirm it for myself without the need to%Nhesitate..."%K%P

0x3418
What...?%K What is she going to confirm...?%K%P

0x3424
"I also... loved that boy..."%K%P

0x3430
I didn't know...%K%P

0x343C
I had no idea... that Saki felt that way...%K%P

0x3448
I had no idea...%K%P

0x3454
But why tell me now, of all times?%K%P

0x3460
I don't...%K I don't understand you... Saki...%K%P

0x346C
Or is it that I'm not trying to understand...?%K%P

0x3478
It feels like there's a slicing pain in my chest...%K%P

0x3484
I look back and forth between Makoto and Saki.%K%P

0x3490
Makoto is eating the meal with great vigor.%K%P

0x349C
Saki eats her meal with an unconcerned face.%K%P

0x34A8
...Just then, Makoto's eyes fix on me.%K%P

0x34B4
A worried expression rises to Makoto's face, and it%Nlooks like he wants to open his mouth and say%Nsomething...%K%P

0x34C8
Kurumi「Hey, Kurumi just got a good idea.」%K%P

0x34DC
Kurumi「There's an old graveyard close by♪」%K%P

0x34E8
Kurumi「How about having a Test of Courage there!!?」%K%P

0x34FC
...%K%P

0x3584
We're in the dim forest, walking towards the abandoned%Ngraveyard.%K%P

0x3590
I completely forgot... that tonight was the Test of%NCourage.%K%P

0x359C
As usual, I'm not looking forward to it...%K%P

0x35A8
Is it because I'm scared...?%K Or is that I don't feel like%Nhaving fun...?%K%P

0x35B4
I'm still thinking, after all.%K About the meaning of Saki's%Nwords, that is.%K%P

0x35C0
...%K%P

0x35CC
As I keep coming up with no answer, I look for Makoto...%K%P

0x35D8
I don't know why I am.%K It's just that right now, I need%NMakoto.%K%P

0x35E4
The reason doesn't matter.%K%P

0x35F0
...%K%P

0x35FC
Makoto's back...%K%P

0x3608
After a little while, I find Makoto.%K%P

0x3614
However...%K%P

0x3630
(―What!?)%K%P

0x363C
Walking beside Makoto is Saki.%K%P

0x3648
They're talking about something... Unfortunately, I can't%Nmake any of it out.%K%P

0x3654
(Could it be that this is what Saki meant when she said%N"confirm"...?)%K%P

0x3660
Makoto says something.%K When she hears it, Saki looks%Nsurprised, but smiles a second later.%K%P

0x366C
And then, after exchanging a few more words, she%Nleaves Makoto.%K%P

0x3678
Makoto seems to be thinking about something.%K%P

0x3684
Just what was it that they were talking about...?%K%P

0x3690
Could they just have been having a normal%Nconversation? Or was there more to it than that...?%K%P

0x369C
I don't know, but I don't want to try to learn either.%K%P

0x36B0
Izumi「Huh? What's wrong, Yuka-chan? You're just standing%Naround...」%K%P

0x36BC
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x36EC
Izumi「Ah, Yuka-chan!?」%K%P

0x3700
―I suddenly break of into a run.%K%P

0x370C
Run away, run away... I keep running away...%K%P

0x3718
But...%K%P

0x3724
(But where would I even go...?)%K%P

0x37F4
I don't really remember much of what happens after that...%K%N

0x3800
I have fragmented memories of what happened, but not%Nthat much.%K%N%N

0x380C
Makoto and Saki paired up.%K I was paired up with Izumi-san.%K%N

0x3818
As I was confused, I mistook a puppy that jumped out of%Na bush for a severed head.%K%N%N

0x3824
...Those three things are all I remember...%K%P

0x3838
By the time I've come to my senses, I'm lying down on the%Nsofa in the lodge.%K%N%N

0x3844
Makoto said he was tired and went to his room.%K%N

0x3850
Saki had some business to attend to, so she went back%Nto her summer house.%K%N

0x385C
I have no clue what kind of conversation those two had%Nduring the Test of Courage.%K%P

0x3870
The others are all going to the hot springs now.%K%N

0x387C
However, it seems only Kurumi is staying behind in the%Nlodge to watch TV.%K%N%N

0x3888
I decide to go with the others to the hot springs.%K%N

0x3894
My mind is exhausted, so I'm hoping this will calm me%Ndown...%K%P

0x394C
While soaking in the milky white hot spring, I think about%NSaki and Makoto.%K%P

0x3958
The reason that Saki is obsessed with Makoto...%K%P

0x3964
I already understand that and why.%K%P

0x3970
No, I really knew it from the beginning.%K%P

0x397C
I just pretended not to notice so that I could postpone%Nthe answer...%K%P

0x3988
Saki said she loved that boy.%K%P

0x3994
And she said that she's convinced that Makoto%Nresembles that boy.%K%P

0x39A0
Then...%K%P

0x39AC
Then Saki...%K%P

0x39B8
(...definitely loves Makoto...)%K%P

0x39C4
My heart beats with a painful sound.%K%P

0x39D0
...Why am I so bothered by those two?%K%P

0x39DC
I shouldn't care.%K I should just be at ease and ignore it.%K%P

0x39E8
But I... can't think like that...%K%P

0x39F4
Unpleasant feelings are stirring around in my heart.%K%P

0x3AA0
I sit down at the edge of the bath while cooling off my%Nhot body with the pleasantly cool night air.%K%P

0x3AAC
My mind is blank.%K%P

0x3AB8
I might have spent too much time submerged in the water.%K%P

0x3AC4
But thanks to that, the discomfort I felt earlier has%Nconsiderably lessened.%K%P

0x3AD0
I vacantly stare up at the twinkling sky without reason.%K%P

0x3ADC
The crowded stars in the pitch black night sky look like%Njewels all encased together.%K%P

0x3AE8
It's no match for the sky that Makoto and I gazed at that%None night.%K%P

0x3AF4
Even so, my heart trembles from its beauty.%K%P

0x3B24
Izumi「Are you okay, Yuka-chan?」%K%P

0x3B30
Yuka「...Oh, Izumi-san.」%K%P

0x3B3C
Yuka「I felt a little faint, so I thought I'd come here and cool%Ndown...」%K%P

0x3B48
Izumi「I see...」%K%P

0x3B5C
Izumi-san quietly sits down besides me.%K%P

0x3B70
Izumi「...Yuka-chan, your face has been kind of pale since%Ndinner... Did something happen?」%K%P

0x3B7C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3B90
Izumi「Is it anything that you could discuss with me?」%K%P

0x3B9C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3BB0
I look at my feet, soaking in the water, and I gaze up at%Nthe sky one more time.%K%P

0x3BBC
The white steam is inhaled by the black sky and begins%Nto disappear...%K%P

0x3BC8
While looking up at the starry sky, I sway my feet back%Nand forth in the water.%K%P

0x3BD4
...I quietly open my mouth.%K%P

0x3BE0
Yuka「The stars...」%K%P

0x3BF4
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x3C00
Yuka「The stars... They're pretty, aren't they?」%K%P

0x3C14
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x3C28
Izumi「You're right...」%K%P

0x3C34
Yuka「Do you remember the conversation we had at the pool?」%K%P

0x3C48
Izumi「Umm...」%K%P

0x3C54
Yuka「...About spitting images.」%K%P

0x3C68
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x3C74
Yuka「The truth is... I've recently met a person like that.」%K%P

0x3C80
Yuka「That person is the spitting image of a classmate of mine%Nfrom middle school.」%K%P

0x3C8C
Izumi「If I recall correctly... you mentioned something about%Nthem not physically resembling each other...」%K%P

0x3C98
Yuka「Yes...」%K%P

0x3CA4
Yuka「I met that boy for the first time when he ended up in the%Nsame class as me in middle school. In 9th grade, to be%Nprecise...」%K%P

0x3CB0
Yuka「I have a lot of memories of him.」%K%P

0x3CBC
Yuka「It was the first semester of 9th grade.」%K%P

0x3CC8
Yuka「Thinking about it now, that was probably the brightest%Nseason in my life so far...」%K%P

0x3CD4
Yuka「It was the best time of my life...」%K%P

0x3CE0
Yuka「They were days overflowing with great surprises and%Ndelights...」%K%P

0x3CF4
I gently raise my arm and point at the southern skies.%K%P

0x3D00
Izumi-san's gaze follows my finger.%K%P

0x3D0C
Yuka「...That's Leo.」%K%P

0x3D18
In the wide spring night sky, there's many constellations.%K%N

0x3D24
There's one that looks like an inside out "?"%K%N

0x3D30
The one I'm pointing to is in between Virgo and Cancer.%K%P

0x3D3C
Yuka「It's my sign...」%K%P

0x3D48
Yuka「Even now, there's one memory that I can't forget...」%K%P

0x3D54
The rising steam wavers, making it look like the sky filled%Nwith jewels is swaying.%K%P

0x3D60
It's as if it's inviting me to go back to my past...%K%P

0x3D7C
...%K%P

0x3DA4
Yuka「It was June of 2013, in 9th grade... the night of our field%Ntrip.」%K%P

0x3DB0
Yuka「I was in a different environment than usual, seeing a%Ndifferent scenery than usual...」%K%P

0x3DBC
Yuka「I couldn't adjust to that kind of atmosphere, and so I had%Na lot of trouble falling asleep that night.」%K%P

0x3DC8
Yuka「I was surrounded by my classmates.」%K%P

0x3DD4
Yuka「Everyone was engaged in trivial conversations, and%Nbefore I knew it, they had all fallen asleep.」%K%P

0x3DE0
Yuka「I was left alone, staring at an unfamiliar ceiling...」%K%P

0x3DEC
Yuka「Before long, I casually made my way out of the covers%Nand gazed outside the window.」%K%P

0x3DF8
Yuka「There were many beautiful stars...」%K%P

0x3E04
Yuka「And then, I snuck past all the teachers on guard and%Nwent outside the hotel.」%K%P

0x3E10
Izumi「Oh my...」%K%P

0x3E1C
Yuka「I looked up at that beautiful night sky while intoxicated%Nby a sense of achievement of having successfully%Nsnuck out.」%K%P

0x3E28
Yuka「And then, I suddenly felt someone's presence behind%Nme, so I frantically turned around.」%K%P

0x3E34
Yuka「I thought that I'd surely been found by a teacher.」%K%P

0x3E40
Yuka「But the one there was neither a teacher nor a stranger...」%K%P

0x3E4C
Izumi「...Was it that boy?」%K%P

0x3E58
Yuka「Yes...」%K%P

0x3E64
Yuka「When I asked him 'why are you here?', he said that 'I%Ncouldn't sleep at all' with a bitter smile.」%K%P

0x3E70
Izumi「You two were quite similar...」%K%P

0x3E7C
Yuka「I wonder about that...?」%K%P

0x3E88
Yuka「...We stood next to each other, and gazed at the stars.」%K%P

0x3E94
Yuka「While doing so, we made no conversation at all, and so I%Nfelt awkward and nervous.」%K%P

0x3EA0
Yuka「And then, that boy suddenly called out to me, saying...」%K%P

0x3EAC
Yuka「'Yuka, what's your sign?'」%K%P

0x3EB8
...%K%P

0x3F4C
Boy「Yuka, what's your sign?」%K%P

0x3F58
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x3F64
Boy「You know, your Zodiac sign... like Aries, Virgo-」%K%P

0x3F70
Yuka「A-Ah... right, right...」%K%P

0x3F7C
Yuka「I'm... a Leo, I think?」%K%P

0x3F88
Boy「A Leo... huh...」%K%P

0x3F94
Boy「Unfortunately, you can't see it, but if it were April, it'd%Nappear right around here.」%K%P

0x3FA0
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x3FAC
Boy「Leo... That's the constellation of the man-eating lion that%NHercules exterminated in the Nemean Forest.」%K%P

0x3FB8
Yuka「M-Man-eating... lion??」%K%P

0x3FC4
Boy「Yeah.」%K%P

0x3FD0
Yuka「That's not romantic at all～...」%K%P

0x3FDC
Boy「H-Hey, I'm not the one who made it up...」%K%P

0x3FE8
Yuka「Then what about you? What's your sign?」%K%P

0x3FF4
Boy「Mine? Mine's...」%K%P

0x4000
...The boy then told me the mythology behind many of the%Nconstellations, including his own.%K%P

0x400C
He had a clear, soft, and gentle voice...%K%P

0x4018
Yuka「Mmm... the myths surrounding the 12 constellations aren't%Nvery romantic stories.」%K%P

0x4024
Yuka「Nothing but exterminations, transformations, hunts, and%Nso on...」%K%P

0x4030
Boy「...You're quite selfish.」%K%P

0x403C
Yuka「But it's true. Those are all just boring stories...」%K%P

0x4048
Boy「...」%K%P

0x4054
Boy「...All right. Well then, oh selfish princess, I shall tell you a%Nromantic story!」%K%P

0x4060
Yuka「Yep, that's much better♪」%K%P

0x406C
Boy「Geez, you really are a selfish girl...」%K%P

0x4078
Boy「This is also about a constellation you can't see in this%Nseason...」%K%P

0x4084
Yuka「Which constellation?」%K%P

0x4090
Boy「...」%K%P

0x409C
Boy「Gemini.」%K%P

0x40A8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x40B4
Boy「...In the past, there were these twin brothers who got%Nalong very well.」%K%P

0x40C0
Boy「Their names were Castor and Pollux.」%K%P

0x40CC
Boy「The two of them were the sons of the supreme god Zeus,%Nwho had transformed into a swan, and the Queen of%NSparta, Leda.」%K%P

0x40D8
Boy「The older brother, Castor, was mortal, and a master of%Nfencing. The younger brother, Pollux, was immortal, on top%Nof also being a master of boxing and horse riding...」%K%P

0x40E4
