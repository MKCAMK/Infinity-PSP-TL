??「... Are you awake?」%K%P

0x68

Makoto「... K-Kurumi!?」%K%P

0x124
Kurumi「That's right! It's Kurumi!!」%K%P

0x130
Makoto「What is it...? Coming in so suddenly... at this time...」%K%P

0x154
Kurumi「What!? Did you forget, Onii-chan? At noon, Kurumi said%Nshe was coming over to visit, didn't she?」%K%P

0x160
Kurumi「See, you and the others are going back very soon. So%NKurumi thought she wanted have more fun with you all.」%K%P

0x16C
Certainly, now that she mentions it, I feel that she did%Nsay that...%K%P

0x178
Makoto「... Now that I think about it, you're right. So then, do you%Nwant to play something?」%K%P

0x18C
Kurumi「Huh? Can we play anything?」%K%P

0x198
Makoto「... If it's something too extreme, then please cut me a%Nbreak.」%K%P

0x1AC
Kurumi「To be honest, Kurumi just wanted to talk to you,%NOnii-chan... But if you say so, then Kurumi wonders if she%Nshould think up something.」%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1C4
I'm stunned.%K%N

0x1D0
As my mind is still in a daze from waking up, I'm unable to%Nunderstand Kurumi's words very well.%K%P

0x1E4
Kurumi「Well then... umm...」%K%P

0x1F0
Kurumi sits down on the bed next to me, acting like she's%Ndeep in thought.%K%P

0x1FC
She's so close to me that our shoulders are almost%Ntouching each other... Kurumi is blushing a little.%K%P

0x218
―And at that time!%K%P

0x248
From outside the partly open door, I hear the sound of%Nsomething striking the floor.%K%P

0x254
Kurumi「Huh? Huh? What was that?」%K%P

0x268
I quickly stand up, and open the door.%K%P

0x2BC
But there's no one in the living room.%K%N

0x2C8
I survey the entire room, then my gaze turns to the floor.%K%P

0x2D4
There's something in front of my room...%K%N

0x2E0
Lying at the foot of the door is...%K%N

0x2EC
―"Aspirin".%K%P

0x2F8
The box of medicine seems to have been thrown%Nconsiderably hard, as it's smashed.%K%P

0x304
(... It couldn't be...)%K%P

0x338
I feel uneasiness strike me like pain.%K%P

0x360
I immediately rush over to the front of Haruka's room, and%Nknock on her door.%K%P

0x3B4
I knock again, harder this time, but there's no response.%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「Haruka! Haruka! Are you there!?」%K%P

0x3CC
??「Makoto...」%K%P

0x3D8
Suddenly, I hear someone calling me from behind, so I%Nturn around.%K%P

0x3EC
Yuka「Huh, what are you doing? If you're looking for Haruka, she%Njust went outside, saying she was going to take a walk.」%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0x40C
Yuka「It seemed like she was crying... Ah... you were mean to%NHaruka, weren't you!?」%K%P

0x418
Yuka「Get a hold of yourself... Geez... Haruka is pure, you know.」%K%P

0x424
Makoto「Hey, Yuka... Haruka... w-went outside...!?」%K%P

0x438
Yuka「Didn't. I. Just. Say. That? She went outside... Ah, hold it!」%K%P

0x44C
I immediately brush Yuka aside and start running.%K%P

0x458
I rush through the living room, and fling open the front%Ndoor with all of my strength.%K%P

0x4AC
I rush outside faster than a bullet.%K%P

0x4B8
And like that, I head towards the hill road.%K%P

0x4C4
Just then...%K%P

0x4D0
Kurumi「Wait! Wait, Onii-chan! Where are you going!? Don't leave%NKurumi alone!!」%K%P

0x4DC
... As I run fiercely, I hear Kurumi's voice from behind me.%K%P

0x4F0
When I turn around, I see Kurumi standing there, staring%Nat me with concerned eyes.%K%N

0x4FC
But there's no time for me to be loafing around.%K%P

0x508
Makoto「I'm going to look for Haruka!」%K%P

0x514
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x520
Makoto「I'll be back soon, so wait in the lodge!」%K%P

0x534
I plunge into the darkness after leaving her with those%Nwords...%K%P

0x5B0
Could it be that Haruka knows that Kurumi is her Original...?%K%P

0x5BC
If that's true...%K%N

0x5C8
If that's true, then... Haruka must have been really hurt!%K%P

0x5D4
She saw me, who was supposed to have a headache, all%Nalone with Kurumi, who was sitting really close to me on%Nthe bed...%K%P

0x5E0
An ominous presentiment crosses my mind.%K%P

0x5EC
As time passes, the stirring in my heart swells more and%Nmore, to the point where it feels endless.%K%P
