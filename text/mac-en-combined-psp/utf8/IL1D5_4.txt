In the end, I couldn't get any sleep after that.%K%P

0x4C
Staying in my room became unbearable, so I headed%Nover to Lunabeach to wait for it to open.%K%P

0x58
At any rate, I want to see Izumi-san's smile as soon as%Npossible.%K%P

0x64
I stand in front of the shop, and bolt open the door.%K%P

0xB0
Izumi「Huh? Makoto-kun? What's wrong? You're here so early.」%K%P

0xBC
Izumi-san's kind smile...%K%P

0xC8
That smile instantly calms my heart down.%K%P

0xD4
Makoto「W-Well... I don't really have anything to do today, so I%Nthought I'd help you out...」%K%P

0xE0
Izumi「Hu～uh? What a curious turn of events. Why?」%K%P

0xFC
Makoto「Remember the promise we made when I lost our race at%Nthe pool?」%K%P

0x108
Izumi「?」%K%P

0x114
Makoto「'One day, I'll help you out at Lunabeach.'」%K%P

0x120
Izumi「Oh～. That's what you mean... It's fine, you don't have to%Ndo that...」%K%P

0x12C
Makoto「But I do. 'A man never goes back on his word', remember?」%K%P

0x138
Izumi「Hee hee... that's true.」%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「Besides, believe it or not, I sometimes like to do selfless%Ndeeds for fun.」%K%P

0x158
Izumi「Hmm... That sounds like a complete lie.」%K%P

0x164
Makoto「Wha...!」%K%P

0x170
Izumi「Now then, confess. What are you planning?」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「Ouch...! That hurts...」%K%P

0x188
Izumi「Hee hee, just kidding... I was just trying an imitation of%Nyou, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x194
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1A0
Izumi「Right... Well then, if you wouldn't mind, please go ahead...」%K%P

0x1AC
Izumi「It sorta feels like today will be busy...」%K%P

0x1B8
Izumi-san goes back to her normal routine.%K%N

0x1C4
A wave of relief sweeps through me...%K%P

0x1D0
The truth is, the real reason I came here was to watch%Nover Izumi-san and act as her bodyguard.%K%P

0x1DC
I have to prevent the incident in that dream from%Nhappening, no matter what.%K%P

0x1E8
I must... protect Izumi-san...%K%P

0x1F4
I know that it won't happen today.%K%P

0x200
But if something does happen today, it might be the%Ncause of what happens tomorrow...%K%P

0x20C
When I think of it that way, I feel uneasy.%K%P

0x218
(For the next two days... I will definitely protect Izumi-san!)%K%P

0x224
I have to.%K%P

0x240
... ... ...%K%P

0x270
Thus, I work at Lunabeach today without pay...%K%P

0x27C
Oddly enough, Izumi-san's prediction was right on the%Nmark, as there are tons of customers today...%K%P

0x290
Izumi「And what's more... it seems that Kurumi picked today of%Nall days to go out and play...」%K%P

0x29C
Izumi-san grumbles this when it gets incredibly busy.%K%N

0x2A8
I can't help but bitterly smile at those words.%K%P

0x2B4
But man, today is REALLY busy!%K%N

0x2C0
How we're attracting so many customers, I have no idea.%K%P

0x2CC
Unaccustomed to this level of customers, Izumi's%Nscatterbrain mode is on turbo right now.%K%P

0x2E0
...%K%P

0x2F4
Izumi「Whew～, my eyes are a bit tired...」%K%P

0x300
Makoto「AH! Izumi-san! Don't rub your eyes while holding that%Nkitchen knife!!」%K%P

0x314
...%K%P

0x328
Izumi「Umm... the customer with the peperoncino and the%Nsteamed clam saut▲e was... um-」%K%P

0x334
Makoto「Izumi-san! In front of you!」%K%P

0x348
Izumi「Huh? Kyaa!!!」%K%P

0x354
Makoto「A-AHHHH!!」%K%P

0x588
Izumi「That was close... I almost fell...」%K%P

0x59C
Izumi「Huh? Makoto-kun, why are you lying on the ground?%NGeez, I won't consent to any slacking off!」%K%P

0x5A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5BC
...%K%P

0x5D0
Izumi「Mmm... I can't reach it...」%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「Ah...! Izumi-san! I'll do it! Don't pile all those chairs up, it's%Ntoo dangerous!!」%K%P

0x5F0
...%K%P

0x5FC
Izumi-san's close calls have scared me to death.%K%P

0x608
Because it's so busy, time passes by as fast as a%Nspeeding arrow...%K%P

0x668
And then, at evening...%K%P

0x690
The customers finally stop coming.%K%P

0x6A4
Izumi「Makoto-kun, shall we take a little break...?」%K%P

0x6B0
Once the last customer has left, Izumi-san turns the%Nplate on the entrance from "OPEN" to "CLOSED" and%Ncomes back.%K%P

0x6C4
Izumi「Here you go...」%K%P

0x6D0
As she says this, Izumi-san places a cup of black tea%Ndown in front of me.%K%P

0x6DC
I guess you could call this tea time, huh...%K%P

0x6E8
Izumi-san takes her own tea, and sits down opposite of%Nme.%K%P

0x6F4
It's so quiet here that it feels like that the hustle and%Nbustle that was going on just minutes ago never%Nhappened...%K%P

0x700
Suddenly, I remember those words from last night.%K%P

0x70C
"... So please... For this short time, let me love you..."%K%P

0x718
... The one who said those words is sitting in front of me%Nright now.%K%P

0x724
As soon as I think that, my chest feels hot, and I get a%Nlittle nervous.%K%P

0x730
I'm too shaken up to make eye contact with Izumi-san.%K%P

0x744
As I avert my eyes, I concentrate on Izumi-san's words...%K%P

0x750
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun. This morning, I got a present from Kurumi.」%K%P

0x75C
Izumi「According to her, it seems she found it on Princess%NBeach.」%K%P

0x768
Izumi「... Hey, why are you looking in that direction?」%K%P

0x774
Makoto「... Oh... that's right. I slept funny last night, so my neck is%Nkilling me...」%K%P

0x780
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x78C
Izumi「Speaking of which, about last night...」%K%P

0x798
Makoto「A-Ah... last night was really cold. I think I'm coming down%Nwith a cold... *cough, cough*.」%K%P

0x7A4
Izumi「... A-Are you all right?」%K%P

0x7B0
Makoto「Y-Yes... I should be perfectly fine.」%K%P

0x7BC
This conversation is making me so overly-conscious of%Nmyself that I'm getting flustered.%K%P

0x7C8
I'm restless. The way she's acting, it seems like she'll end%Nup asking me "What's your answer from last night?" any%Nminute now...%K%P

0x7E4
Just then, out of the blue...%K%P

0x80C
Izumi「I'm sorry.」%K%P

0x818
... Izumi-san apologizes.%K%P

0x824
Not expecting to hear those words, I stare at Izumi-san,%Ndumbfounded.%K%P

0x838
Izumi「I said those things last night without taking your feelings%Ninto account...」%K%P

0x844
Izumi「If I had known it would make things this awkward... I%Nwouldn't have said it.」%K%P

0x850
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x85C
Izumi「I'm... an idiot.」%K%P

0x868
Izumi-san's eyes cloud up slightly.%K%P

0x874
Makoto「No way... it's just... I...」%K%P

0x880
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x88C
Makoto「... Sorry.%K I just don't know yet if I feel the same way...」%K%P

0x898
Makoto「Would you give me... a little time... to think about it?」%K%P

0x8A4
Izumi「Yes... don't rush your answer...」%K%P

0x8B0
The way she says that makes it sound like she's in pain...%K%P

0x8BC
I... just what should I do?%K%P

0x924
Before long, it's the shop's closing time.%K%P

0x930
In the end, Lunabeach's business hours concluded%Nsafely and uneventfully.%K%P

0x93C
Nothing happened to Izumi-san.%K%P

0x948
Despite feeling relieved, I can't help but get gloomy.%K%P

0x954
Our conversation this evening...%K%P

0x960
Thanks to that, the atmosphere between Izumi-san and I%Nhas become awkward.%K%P

0x96C
Izumi-san silently carried on with her work, as if nothing%Never happened...%K%P

0x978
I was unable to say anything to Izumi-san in that state.%K%P

0x984
The two of us are alone in the shop...%K%N

0x990
The mood is still rather awkward...%K%P

0x99C
In order to wipe away the atmosphere, I invite Izumi-san%Nto the lodge.%K%P

0x9A8
I bet that if we're with the others, the mood will surely%Nbrighten up.%K%P

0x9B4
Izumi-san willingly accepts my invitation.%K%P

0x9C0
The two of us begin walking to the lodge.%K%P

0x9FC
When we arrive at the lodge, Izumi-san makes dinner.%K%P

0xA08
It tastes good, but it's not as great as her usual%Ncooking.%K%P

0xA14
Of course, it could simply be my imagination...%K%P

0xA20
After we eat...%K%P

0xA6C
Izumi「Well then... after I'm done cleaning up, don't you think we%Nbetter be getting back, Kurumi?」%K%P

0xA78
... Izumi-san prompts Kurumi, and stands up.%K%P

0xA94
Kurumi「Hu～uh!? We have to go back already?」%K%P

0xAA0
Kurumi complains about Izumi-san's request.%K%P

0xAAC
And then, I decide to try laying out a proposition.%K%P

0xAB8
Makoto「Hey, why don't you two sleep over here tonight?」%K%P

0xACC
Kurumi「What!? Is it really okay?」%K%P

0xAE0
Izumi「Kurumi! ... I know we came all the way out here, but we%Nreally can't, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0xAEC
Izumi「I have work tomorrow too, so...」%K%P

0xB08
Yuka「Oh, it's all right, isn't it? It's simple. Look, if you're worried%Nabout bedrooms, we've got some there and up there...」%K%P

0xB14
Yuka points at my room and the loft.%K%P

0xB30
Okuhiko「Hey! Those are our rooms, aren't they?」%K%P

0xB3C
Yuka「Don't worry, don't worry♪」%K%P

0xB48
Makoto「Izumi-san, you really don't have to worry about it, it's%Nfine. We'll all make sure you get up early enough in the%Nmorning...」%K%P

0xB6C
I try to be as persuasive as possible.%K%P

0xB78
If Izumi-san goes back now, it'll be troublesome.%K%P

0xB84
In three hours, the date will change.%K%P

0xB90
As long as I can see Izumi-san, she'll be safe...%K%P

0xBA4
Izumi「... Haah...」%K%P

0xBB0
Izumi「... All right, we accept.」%K%P

0xBBC
Izumi「But don't worry about rooms. Kurumi and I will be okay%Njust sleeping together on the living room sofa...」%K%P

0xBC8
Makoto「In that case, then you can use the loft, Izumi-san♪」%K%P

0xC00
Okuhiko「Hey, that's my room!」%K%P

0xC0C
Makoto「There's just something a little too big in there, but it can%Nbe removed.」%K%P

0xC20
Okuhiko「L-Listen to me, dammit!!」%K%P

0xC2C
Makoto「Don't worry, don't worry♪」%K%P

0xC38
Okuhiko「I'm worried!!」%K%P

0xC44
Yuka「It's all right～♪ If it's you, Okuhiko-kun, then you should%Nbe able to sleep elegantly even on the sofa♪」%K%P

0xC50
Okuhiko「Just how the hell do you sleep elegantly on a sofa!!」%K%P

0xC5C
Just then, Haruka tugs on Okuhiko's clothes as he%Nwhines.%K%P

0xC78
Haruka「Okuhiko... if you're a man, then just put up with it...」%K%P

0xC8C
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0xC98
Haruka「... Isn't this where you say 'yes'?」%K%P

0xCAC
Okuhiko「... Yes.」%K%P

0xCB8
It seems Okuhiko is unable to withstand Haruka's%Ncomment.%K%P

0xCE4
Kurumi「Sorry, Okkun...」%K%P

0xCF8
Okuhiko「No, it's fine... Now that you mention it, I was in the mood for%Nsleeping on the sofa today...」%K%P

0xD04
Okuhiko says this quite sullenly.%K%P

0xD20
Kurumi「Yaay♪ Let's all play a card game tonight, guys!」%K%P

0xD2C
The overjoyed Kurumi skips about the room.%K%P

0xD48
Izumi-san furrows her brow at this, as if to say, "can't be%Nhelped".%K%P
