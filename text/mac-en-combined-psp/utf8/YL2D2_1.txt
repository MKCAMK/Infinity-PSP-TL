Just as we promised yesterday, we go to the pool.%K%P

0x178
I arrive at the pool.%K%P

0x184
I'm not worried about Kurumi.%K%P

0x190
I already know that she's faking her illness...%K%P

0x19C
The sun's brilliant rays are bathing me in its light.%K%P

0x1A8
For some reason, my body is itching to dive in.%K%P

0x1D0
I immediately dive underwater.%K%P

0x1DC
I swim from end to end, then do a quick turn without taking%Na breather...%K%P

0x1E8
I return to the starting point again...%K%P

0x1F4
Makoto「FWAAH!」%K%P

0x200
... and take a deep breath.%K%P

0x20C
When I casually look up, I see someone looking down%Nupon me from the high edge of the pool.%K%P

0x230
Yuka「Here!」%K%P

0x258
It's Yuka.%K%P

0x264
She bends over and holds out her right hand.%K%P

0x270
Makoto「Oh, thank you.」%K%P

0x27C
I take her hand, and step onto the poolside with one foot.%K%P

0x288
I put my weight into that hand and try to climb up, when...%K%P

0x2B8
... I instead pull on Yuka's arm with all of my strength.%K%P

0x2C4
Yuka falls into the pool at an awkward angle.%K%P

0x2D0
Makoto「Gahahahahahahaha♪」%K%P

0x2DC
I quickly get up on the poolside, look down on Yuka, and%Nlaugh loudly.%K%P

0x2E8
Yuka's face emerges out of the water...%K%P

0x2F4
Yuka「Ba-Bagodo!」%K%P

0x300
Her voice sounds weird due to the large amount of water%Nin her nose.%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「Heh heh! Serves you right!」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「Karma's a bitch, huh?!」%K%P

0x334
Yuka「Guh... yuu reebempard daaat...」%K%P

0x348
Yuka「Jeesh, whaa aah yuu doin'...!」%K%P

0x354
Yuka frowns as she climbs out of the pool.%K%P

0x368
Makoto「Ah, your nose is dripping with snot... nasty!」%K%P

0x37C
Yuka「U-U-Ughhhh...」%K%P

0x388
Yuka clenches her hand into a fist as she trembles.%K%P

0x394
Makoto「Ah...」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Are you... mad at me?」%K%P

0x3AC
Yuka「I'm not!」%K%P

0x3B8
No matter how you look at it, she's obviously angry...%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「All right! Got it! It can't be helped, so I'll treat you to a%Ndrink!」%K%P

0x3D8
Yuka「Huh? Beer?♪」%K%P

0x3E4
Makoto「Dumbass! I'm not letting you drink alcohol!」%K%P

0x3F8
Yuka「Whyyyy nooot...?」%K%P

0x404
Makoto「You know why!」%K%P

0x418
Yuka「Boo...」%K%P

0x424
Makoto「Well, I'll go and buy you something appropriate... so wait%Nhere.」%K%P

0x438
I say that before walking over towards the drink stand...%K%P

0x4B4
But when I get back...%K%P

0x4D0
Yuka「Fwah...!」%K%P

0x4DC
... Yuka is sitting in the deckchair, a glass of beer%Nclutched in her hand.%K%P

0x4E8
Yuka「Oh, welcome back～♪」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「Y-Yuka... When did you get that beer...」%K%P

0x500
Yuka「Oh, this? Okuhiko-kun bought it for me just now.」%K%P

0x50C
Yuka「Okuhiko-kun's a really thoughtful guy...」%K%P

0x520
Yuka「Unlike a certain someone else...」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「Then what should I do with this ginger ale that I bought?」%K%P

0x540
Yuka「Whoa! You bought ginger ale?♪」%K%P

0x54C
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x558
Yuka「You're the best, Makoto! This is the best choice possible!」%K%P

0x564
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x570
I don't get what's she's rambling about, but I give her the%Nginger ale anyway.%K%P

0x57C
Just then, Yuka takes the half empty beer glass, and%Npours the ginger ale into it, filling it up.%K%P

0x588
Makoto「Does that taste good?」%K%P

0x594
As I ask, I sit down next to Yuka.%K%P

0x5A0
Yuka「Makoto, you don't know what shandygaff is?」%K%P

0x5AC
Makoto「Huh? Panty rash?」%K%P

0x5D4
Yuka「Shandygaff!! It's the name of a cocktail!」%K%P

0x5E0
Yuka「... You knew that, didn't you?」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「No.」%K%P

0x5F8
I play dumb.%K%P

0x60C
Yuka「Come on, geez...」%K%P

0x644
We bathe in the warm sun until the afternoon.%K%P

0x650
Before my eyes, I saw kids innocently diving into the%Npool...%K%P

0x65C
Intoxicated by the peaceful atmosphere, I forget%Nsomething important...%K%P

0x668
Something VERY important...%K%N

0x674
That's...%K%P

0x6C4
Saki「Shouldn't we be leaving now?」%K%P

0x6D8
As soon as Saki says this, we all simultaneously begin%Npreparing to go back.%K%P

0x6E4
However, there's still one other person roaming,%Nstaggering by the poolside.%K%P

0x6F0
Said person staggers towards us and comes up to us...%K%P

0x704
Yuka「Huh? Ah we goin' back arready, guysh?」%K%P

0x710
... then speaks.%K%P

0x71C
Saki「Yeah. It's already getting cold, right?」%K%P

0x728
Yuka「Culd? Yer culd?」%K%P

0x73C
Yuka「Buh I'm naht culd at all.」%K%P

0x750
She's speaking in a comedic drunk tone...%K%P

0x75C
Yes... I completely forgot about it.%K%P

0x768
Since I forgot to stop Yuka from drinking after her first%Ncup, she has continued drinking as I remained blissfully%Nunaware...%K%P

0x774
I shudder when I think of the events that will probably%Nfollow.%K%P

0x780
In other words, it's like this.%K%P

0x78C
The drunk Yuka returns to Lunabeach→%K%N

0x798
→She declares that she wants toro→%K%N

0x7A4
→Everyone goes fishing→%K%P

0x7B0
→Saki is swallowed by the wave!%K%P

0x7BC
When I realize this on the way back, I try to take Yuka's%Ncup away.%K%P

0x7C8
I also try to explain to her about the Saki issue.%K%P

0x7D4
But Yuka won't listen to me.%K%P

0x7E8
Yuka「Ish faine, ish faine!」%K%P

0x7F4
Yuka「Ash long ash we don't go fishin', den ish faine, ishen't it?」%K%P

0x808
... Can I really trust those words???%K%P
