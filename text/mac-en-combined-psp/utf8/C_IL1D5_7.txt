After noon, Lunabeach suddenly became busy.%K%N

0xB4
Customers just keep pouring in and out.%K%N

0xC0
Izumi-san returned to work, still unsatisfied.%K%N

0xCC
Naturally, Kurumi helped out.%K%P

0xE0

0xEC
I was left all alone, so I reluctantly left Lunabeach...%K%N%N

0xF8
But even though I left the shop, I had no clue where to%Ngo.%K%N

0x104
So, I staggered alongside the coastline road, and%Nbefore I knew it... I was here.%K%P

0x188
That's right... I'm at Viewpoint Park now.%K%P

0x194
The scenery I see from the end of the cape is colorless.%K%P

0x1A0
The gray skies make me feel like I'm in an old black and%Nwhite photo.%K%P

0x1AC
The air is very damp, but there's no sea breeze. The%Nonly sound I hear is that of the waves breaking on the%Ncape.%K%P

0x1C4
Makoto「Schr▼dinger's cat, huh...」%K%P

0x1D0
I mutter this to myself as I blankly stare at this colorless%Nworld.%K%P

0x1DC
I didn't really understand what Kurumi said back at the%Nshop at all.%K%P

0x1E8
However, I feel that I somewhat understand what she%Nwanted to say.%K%P

0x20C
Kurumi「What's already happened has happened, so it can't be%Nhelped!」%K%P

0x220
That phenomenon from earlier... Kurumi was probably%Ntrying to say that what happened with the cards wasn't%Nstrange.%K%P

0x22C
(But... is that really true?)%K%P

0x238
No, when I think about it calmly, there's no way that I can%Nthink it wasn't strange.%K%P

0x244
Pairing all the cards correctly... There's... no way that's%Npossible!%K%P

0x258
Izumi「And there's absolutely no way that Makoto-kun should%Nhave known the positioning of those 46 cards, right?」%K%P

0x26C
"Absolutely no way..."%K%P

0x278
In other words, that's the way it is.%K%P

0x284
There's no way that event could have happened unless%NI'd known all of the positions of the cards!%K%P

0x290
―A premonition.%K%N

0x29C
It was another premonition, just like all the others...%K%P

0x2A8
―Haruka falling onto Moon Beach.%K%N

0x2B4
―The fact that there was no rice left at Lunabeach.%K%N

0x2C0
―The earthquake at Tsukiya Hotel's pool.%K%P

0x2CC
―The car battery.%K%N

0x2D8
―What we were eating for dinner.%K%N

0x2E4
―And those cards...%K%P

0x2F0
...%K%P

0x30C
But... wait...%K%N

0x318
Is that really it...?%K%P

0x324
Can I really call the phenomenon with the cards a%N"premonition"?%K%P

0x330
For example, if I had known in advance which card was%Nwhich, I would have been able to intentionally go for the%Nspecific cards that would form pairs.%K%P

0x33C
But that's not what happened.%K%N

0x348
No, it couldn't have happened!%K%P

0x354
Because I "didn't know" what any of the cards were until%NI flipped them...%K%P

0x360
Because I "didn't know", I just randomly flipped over%Ncards and happened to get pairs...%K%P

0x36C
(If that's so...)%K%P

0x378
(... Then what the hell was that phenomenon?)%K%P

0x384
(If it wasn't a simple "premonition", then what was it...?)%K%P

0x390
My mind begins to fall into confusion once again.%K%P

0x39C
I can't see anything. I can't hear anything. The only thing%NI can feel is an unfamiliar fear wriggling in my heart.%K%P

0x3A8
(Why... Why... did this happen...?)%K%P

0x3B4
Everything started with that dream.%K%P

0x3C0
That hopeless dream... from the morning... of the 1st...%K%P

0x3CC
If I hadn't had that dream...%K%N

0x3D8
Then none of this... would be happening...%K%P

0x44C
Izumi... san...%K%P

0x478
Is there no way to avert the events of my dream?%K%P

0x484
Despite my foreknowledge, is the future something that%Ncannot be changed?%K%P

0x490
Then... Izumi-san will...%K%N

0x49C
Tomorrow... Izumi-san will...%K%P

0x4B8
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x4C4
Izumi「I...」%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi「I...」%K%P

0x4EC
Last night, Izumi-san said that.%K%P

0x4F8
Here... At this place...%K%P

0x504
She said it on the spot I'm standing right now...%K%P

0x520
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0x538
Makoto「Why does Izumi-san have to die!!!?」%K%P

0x544
―Clang!%K%P

0x550
I kick the iron fence with all of my might.%K%P

0x55C
―Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!%K%P

0x568
I kick it countless times, to the point where I want to%Ndestroy it.%K%P

0x574
My seeping anger is overflowing.%K%P

0x580
I kick and I kick it, but the fence won't give an inch.%K%P

0x58C
Nothing is breaking...%K%P

0x598
That only serves to make me more irritated than before.%K%P

0x5A4
―Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!%K%P

0x5B0
―Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!%K%P

0x5BC
The dull sound of my kicks against the iron echoes%Nunder the grey skies...%K%P

0x5F4
... ... ...%K%P
