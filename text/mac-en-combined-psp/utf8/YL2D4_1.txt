After we finish eating our ham and mozzarella cheese%Nsandwiches, Yuka and I walk by the morning coastline.%K%P

0x150
This time, I decide to go with Yuka to see the cherry%Nblossoms.%K%P

0x164
Like last time, I decide to go with Yuka to see the cherry%Nblossoms.%K%P

0x170
When I look up, I see the very picture of a wide, blue sky.%K%P

0x17C
The springtime haze is hanging in the air all across the%Nsea, making a yacht traveling across the water seem%Nlike an illusion as it creates whitecaps.%K%P

0x188
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Aren't we going to see the cherry blossoms%Nagain?」%K%P

0x194
I ask her this.%K%P

0x1A0
I did say that we were going to see the cherry%Nblossoms, but I don't actually know if that's for certain.%K%P

0x1AC
In any case, we've already seen the cherry blossoms%Ntwice: once on the last 4th, and once two days ago...%K%P

0x1C0
Yuka「No. We're not going today.」%K%P

0x1CC
Yuka answers.%K%P

0x1D8
Yuka「Why don't we go to Lunabeach to relax and pass the%Ntime instead?」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「Yeah, good idea. We have to meet with everyone at%NLunabeach at 5:00 anyway...」%K%P

0x1F8
Yuka「Besides... looking at those cherry blossoms just makes%Nme remember him.」%K%P

0x204
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x210
Yuka「The first boy that I loved.」%K%P

0x234
―Those words gnaw at my heart.%K%P

0x240
―It grows hot like an angry, blazing fire flaring up.%K%P

0x24C
Why the hell... do I feel so depressed...!?%K%P

0x258
This is an unpleasant feeling that's similar to irritation.%K%P

0x264
... Now that I think about it, yesterday, during the Test of%NCourage... in the end, what was it that Saki tried to say?%K%P

0x270
Saki「Occasionally, at times when I see you act impulsively, it%Nreally feels like I'm hallucinating.」%K%P

0x27C
Saki「It feels just like you're that boy if...」%K%P

0x288
...%K%P

0x2B0
Well, whatever.%K%P

0x2BC
I'm getting too worked up over nothing.%K%P

0x2C8
Something like that is inconsequential to me.%K%P

0x2D4
Even if our attitudes are similar, it's as inconsequential%Nas a grain of sand on the beach.%K%P

0x2E0
If I had it my own way, instead of saying that "I'm similar to%Nthat boy"...%K%P

0x2EC
... the right expression would be, "That boy is similar to%Nme."%K%P

0x2F8
It's not me who's being a copycat, it's that boy.%K%P

0x304
I persuade myself with this absurd reasoning...%K%P

0x354
As usual, Lunabeach has no customers...%K%P

0x360
Yuka and I sip down on Izumi-san's boiling hot coffee.%K%P

0x36C
With no customers at hand, an idle Izumi-san sits with us.%K%P

0x380
Izumi「The clouds are coming in quick...」%K%P

0x38C
Izumi-san suddenly mutters these words.%K%P

0x398
Izumi「At this rate, it'll definitely be cloudy tomorrow.」%K%P

0x3B4
Yuka「Wow... How do you know that?」%K%P

0x3D0
Izumi「Half of it's intuition, half of it's experience.」%K%P

0x3DC
Izumi「When you spend a long time living by the sea, you%Ngradually reach the point where you know these kinds%Nof things.」%K%P

0x3F8
Yuka「Huh...」%K%P

0x40C
Izumi「Shall I tell you one more thing?」%K%P

0x418
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x424
Izumi「There'll be heavy rain starting tomorrow night.」%K%P

0x438
Yuka「!?」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x450
Yuka and I exchange glances.%K%P

0x45C
Izumi「It'll be a great downpour...」%K%P

0x468
Makoto「H-How do you know...?」%K%P

0x47C
Izumi「Ah... are you doubting me?」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「No, that's not it.」%K%P

0x494
Izumi「All right♪ Well then, why don't we make a bet?」%K%P

0x4A0
Makoto「A-A bet?」%K%P

0x4AC
Izumi「On whether it'll rain or not tomorrow night.」%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「There's no way I'd bet on that! Because tomorrow ni―」%K%P

0x4E8
Makoto「Ow!」%K%P

0x4F4
Yuka stomps down on my foot from under the table with%Nall her might.%K%P

0x508
Izumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0x51C
Yuka「You've got it! We'll take you up on that bet!」%K%P

0x530
Izumi「Hee hee, that's the spirit♪」%K%P

0x544
Yuka「After all, there's no way it'll rain with this good weather.」%K%P

0x550
Izumi「Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee...」%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x570
Izumi「... Well then, what's your wager?」%K%P

0x584
Yuka「If it does rain... then on my next summer break, I'll help out%Nat Lunabeach, but only for a week.」%K%P

0x590
Izumi「Really?」%K%P

0x59C
Yuka「Yes!」%K%P

0x5A8
Yuka... she's quite the philanthropist...%K%P

0x5B4
Even though she knows that it's going to rain...%K%P

0x5C8
Izumi「And if it doesn't rain?」%K%P

0x5D4
Yuka「Hmm... let's see...」%K%P

0x5E8
Yuka「Well then, next summer break, please take me out for%Ndrinks. It'll be on you, of course♪」%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi「Yes, all right.」%K%P

0x608
Izumi「... But if you want to back out, now's the time.」%K%P

0x614
Yuka「I'm fine! It definitely won't rain!」%K%P

0x620
She's not going to stop...%K%P

0x62C
So Yuka... really did intend to help out from the beginning...%K%P

0x638
But even so, why does Izumi-san... have so much%Nconfidence?%K%P

0x644
Can you really do something like predict the weather with%Njust intuition and experience?%K%P

0x650
Makoto「But Izumi-san... why are you so confident?」%K%P

0x65C
I try asking her.%K%P

0x670
Izumi「Hee hee... My intuition is very accurate.」%K%P

0x67C
Izumi「When I was in high school, I was known and feared as%N'Sumisora's Laplace'.」%K%P

0x690
Yuka「Sumisora's Laplace?」%K%P

0x6A4
Izumi「Oh, I didn't tell you?」%K%P

0x6B0
Izumi「My alma mater was 'Sumisora Academy'...」%K%P

0x6BC
Yuka「No. That's not it... I meant 'Laplace'...」%K%P

0x6C8
Izumi「Oh... you don't know what 'Laplace' is?」%K%P

0x6D4
Izumi「It refers to 'Laplace's Demon'.」%K

0xEF0
I know what it is.

0xEFC
I don't know.

0x714
Makoto「Yeah, I've heard of it before.」%K%P

0x720
Makoto「According to the words of a French mathematician and%Nastronomer named Laplace...」%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「'Suppose there exists a "demon", that is, an entity that%Npossesses the ability to know, at a certain moment, the%Nstate of all things in the universe...」%K%P

0x738
Makoto「... Then, no matter how brief this moment is, it would always%Nbe enough for the demon to unravel everything that%Nhappened in the past and will happen in the future.'」%K%P

0x744
Yuka「????」%K%P

0x750
Makoto「In short, that old guy said...」%K%P

0x75C
Makoto「... 'Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning.' That's what he's%Nsaying.」%K%P

0x768
Makoto「No matter how big or how small an event is...」%K%P

0x774
Makoto「... Its occurrence is by no means accidental, but in fact%Ninevitable... that's what it means.」%K%P

0x780
Makoto「I believe that in philosophy, this is called 'causal%Ndeterminism'...」%K%P

0x794
Yuka「????????」%K%P

0x7A0
Izumi「That's right. You're well informed, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x7AC
I feel a little proud...%K%P

0x7B8
Izumi「So anyway, when I was in high school...」%K%P

0x7C4
Izumi「... I would boldly make predictions about things other%Npeople didn't know about that proved to be accurate.%NSo my friends called me 'Sumisora's Laplace'.」%K%P

0x7D0
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x7E4
Izumi「... Gotcha♪」%K%P

0x7F8
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x80C
Izumi「That was all a lie!」%K%P

0x818
Izumi「Truth is, I just watched the weather forecast.」%K%P

0x824
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x830
Izumi「When I watched the weather forecast on TV earlier, they%Nsaid that it would start raining heavily tomorrow night♪」%K%P

0x844
Yuka「... T-That's unfair, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x858
Izumi「Tee hee♪」%K%P

0x864
Izumi-san bashfully sticks out her tongue.%K%P

0x878
Makoto「??」%K%P

0x884
Yuka「??」%K%P

0x890
Izumi「I see... You don't know...」%K%P

0x89C
Izumi「These are the words of a French mathematician and%Nastronomer named Laplace.」%K%P

0x8A8
Izumi「'Suppose there exists a 'demon', that is, an entity that%Npossesses the ability to know, at a certain moment, the%Nstate of all things in the universe...」%K%P

0x8B4
Izumi「... Then, no matter how brief this moment is, it would always%Nbe enough for the demon to unravel everything that%Nhappened in the past and will happen in the future.'」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「????」%K%P

0x8D4
Yuka「????」%K%P

0x8E0
Izumi「In short, that man named Laplace was saying this...」%K%P

0x8EC
Izumi「... 'Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning.' That's what he's%Nsaying.」%K%P

0x8F8
Izumi「No matter how big or how small an event is...」%K%P

0x904
Izumi「... Its occurrence is by no means accidental, but in fact%Ninevitable... that's what it means.」%K%P

0x910
Izumi「I believe that in philosophy, this is called 'causal%Ndeterminism'.」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「????????」%K%P

0x928
Yuka「????????」%K%P

0x934
Izumi「And so, when I was in high school...」%K%P

0x940
Izumi「... I would bluntly make predictions about things other%Npeople didn't know about that proved to be accurate.%NSo my friends called me 'Sumisora's Laplace'.」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「I-I see...」%K%P

0x960
Izumi「... Gotcha♪」%K%P

0x974
Makoto「...H-Huh?」%K%P

0x988
Izumi「That was all a lie!」%K%P

0x994
Izumi「Truth is, I just watched the weather forecast.」%K%P

0x9A0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x9AC
Izumi「When I watched the weather forecast on TV earlier, they%Nsaid that it would start raining heavily tomorrow night♪」%K%P

0x9C0
Yuka「... T-That's unfair, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x9D4
Izumi「Tee hee♪」%K%P

0x9E0
Izumi-san bashfully sticks out her tongue.%K%P

0x9EC
I'm...%K%P

0x9F8
... more disturbed by the story of "Laplace's demon"%Nthan Izumi-san's lie.%K%P

0xA04
"Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning... Its occurrence is by%Nno means accidental, but in fact inevitable."%K%P

0xA10
Everything's been predetermined...?%K%P

0xA24
Yuka「Then that means our earlier bet... is now null and void,%Nright?」%K%P

0xA38
Izumi「No way. The forecast's not always correct, is it?」%K%P

0xA44
The two of them smile merrily...%K%P

0xAD8
At 11:17 A.M.―the earthquake attacks.%K%N%N

0xAE4
But since Yuka and I already knew about it, we've gotten%Nto the point where nothing surprises or frightens us%Nanymore.%K%N

0xAF0
Only Izumi-san is upset by this contingency, as her%Ncoffee cups completely broke.%K%N%N

0xAFC
"These recent earthquakes cause us to lose more and%Nmore tableware," she laments.%K%P

0xB10
And so, up until everyone arrives at 5:00, the three of%Nus pass the time exchanging trifling gossip.%K%N

0xB1C
In that time, Izumi-san tells us very interesting stories%Nabout Kurumi.%K%N%N

0xB28
It seems that Kurumi's had vagrant habits ever since%Nshe was a child.%K%P

0xB3C
She would get lost at the amusement park... Would get%Nstranded when going on trips...%K%N%N

0xB48
(Hmm? Is that really what you'd call vagrant?)%K%N%N

0xB54
... Although I think that, Yuka and I can't help%N

0xB60
but to nod every now and then at Izumi-san's words.%K%N

0xB6C
At any rate, today is Thursday, April 4th... the day Kurumi%Nactually went missing.%K%P

0xB80
―Kurumi's disappearance?%K%N%N

0xB8C
I see... now that I think about it, that was how all of this%Nbegan.%K%N

0xB98
The first time Yuka and I went to the shrine was to look%Nfor the missing Kurumi.%K%P

0xBAC
If we didn't see that talisman when we went to the shrine,%Nthen right now, we probably wouldn't be doing something%Nlike repeating this time.%K%N

0xBB8
If that's the case, then making Kurumi go missing might be%Ndangerous.%K%N%N

0xBC4
No, wait a minute.%K%N

0xBD0
There's a much bigger problem with letting it happen than%Nthat, isn't there?%K%P

0xBE4
No matter the circumstances, Kurumi's disappearance%Nisn't something to be grateful for.%K%N

0xBF0
Izumi-san also got extremely worried...%K%N

0xBFC
Yuka and I know that tonight, Kurumi will go missing.%K%N

0xC08
Nevertheless, there's no way that I can let that happen.%K%P

0xC1C
Tonight, I'll be with Kurumi the whole time.%K%N

0xC28
Of course, I'll have Yuka to help me...%K%N

0xC34
It's not like we're going to babysit her, but if we keep a%Nclose eye, we should be able to prevent that incident%Nfrom occurring.%K%N

0xC40
If we could change Saki's history... then we can change%NKurumi's...%K%P
