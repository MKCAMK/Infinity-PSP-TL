Once I finish changing, I throw myself onto the bed.%NHaruka's face faintly forms on the ceiling.%K%P

0x68
What do I think of Haruka?%K%P

0x74
Do I really just think of her like a daughter?%K%P

0x80
Even so, we kissed... No, it was just on the forehead.%K%P

0x8C
Why didn't I kiss her on the lips back then?%K%P

0xA8
At that moment, I hear Okuhiko's voice. As I get out of%Nbed, I wonder what's going on.%K%P

0xB4
He sounds furious. I open the window to find Okuhiko on%Nthe terrace.%K%P

0xC0
He is approaching someone against the wall while yelling%Nat them.%K%P

0xCC
I'm getting a bad feeling about this, so I rush out of my%Nroom.%K%P

0x120
I open the front door, and look towards the terrace.%K%P

0x12C
I can see Okuhiko's back. He's talking to... Haruka. From%Nhere, I can hear their conversation clearly.%K%P

0x138
Okuhiko「Why did you go fishing with Ishihara? What do you see in%Nthat asshole?」%K%P

0x144
Haruka「Makoto... is kind to me...」%K%P

0x150
Okuhiko「Kind? Ishihara? He's nothing but a vulgar bastard. In any%Ncase, it's clear as day that he has a ulterior motive.」%K%P

0x15C
Haruka「We trust each other. You wouldn't understand...」%K%P

0x168
Okuhiko「You're the one who doesn't understand about Ishihara.」%K%P

0x174
Haruka「What's going on between me and Makoto is none of your%Nconcern.」%K%P

0x180
Okuhiko「You're wrong! It does concern me! Haruka-chan, I...!」%K%P

0x18C
Just then, Haruka shoves him aside as she tries to walk%Naway.%K%P

0x198
Before she can, Okuhiko turns around and quickly grabs%Nher by the arm.%K%P

0x1A4
At that time, their eyes lock onto me. A blush rapidly%Nspreads across Haruka's face.%K%P

0x1B0
Okuhiko loudly clicks his tongue, and lets go of Haruka's%Narm.%K%P

0x1CC
When I step onto the terrace, Haruka runs right towards%Nme.%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「Wow, you sure do have a way with the ladies, Almighty%NOkuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0x1F4
Okuhiko「Shut up. You don't have the right to say anything.」%K%P

0x200
Makoto「Whatever. Haruka, let's go.」%K%P

0x21C
Haruka「Wait. Tell him straight.」%K%P

0x228
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x234
Haruka「About me and you. About how we trust each other, no%Nmatter what happens... isn't that right?」%K%P

0x240
Makoto「Wait a min-」%K%P

0x24C
Haruka「Tell Okuhiko. Tell him it doesn't concern him. Tell him we're%Nthe only ones who understand.」%K%P

0x258
Hey, what's all this about?%K%P

0x264
Haruka「Why aren't you saying anything?」%K%P

0x270
Is she trying to confirm my feelings for her?%K%P

0x27C
Up until earlier, wasn't she was the one who said she%Ndidn't understand that!? In my silence, Haruka delivers%Nthe final blow.%K%P

0x288
Haruka「Are you saying we can't trust each other?」%K%P

0x294
Makoto「That's not it, that's not...」%K%P

0x2A0
Haruka「So you don't think anything of me at all... even though%Nyou gave me a kiss...」%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「...!」%K%P

0x2D8
Okuhiko「Y-You kissed her... Ishihara, you son of a bitch!」%K%P

0x2E4
Makoto「Listen, Haruka. It wasn't like that at all earlier.」%K%P

0x2F0
Haruka「What do... you mean?」%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「It wasn't about how I felt about you. It was because...」%K

0x1FD0
"Because you told me to kiss you..."

0x1FDC
"Because..."

0x344
Makoto「Because you told me to ki...」%K%P

0x350
... Wh-What the hell am I saying?%K%P

0x35C
I can't understand why I'm saying this.%K%P

0x5A0
Fortunately, I am interrupted by Okuhiko suddenly%Npunching me. He hits me, and I fall to my knees.%K%P

0x5AC
I quickly look towards Haruka, and although her face is%Nas expressionless as ever, there's a hint of sorrow in%Nher eyes.%K%P

0x5B8
She probably heard what I said.%K%P

0x5CC
Because...%K%P

0x810
At that instant. Okuhiko punches me right in my face,%Nmaking me fall to my knees.%K%P

0x824
Okuhiko「How could you do that to Haruka-chan...! She doesn't%Nbelong to you, dammit!」%K%P

0x830
I spit out saliva and stand up. Okuhiko has seized%NHaruka's shoulders.%K%P

0x83C
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan, what's so good about this irresponsible%Nbastard?」%K%P

0x848
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x854
Okuhiko「I'm different. I'm beyond a level of trust with you. I love%Nyou...!」%K%P

0x860
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x86C
Okuhiko「You don't understand? Look at me! The man who loves%Nyou is right here!」%K%P

0x878
Haruka turns her head away from Okuhiko, and looks at%Nme. Her expression darkens.%K%P

0x894
Haruka「I... don't understand... because... I have no heart...」%K%P

0x8A0
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan...!」%K%P

0x8AC
Makoto「Stop it, Okuhiko! Haruka is starting to find her 'heart'!」%K%P

0x8B8
Okuhiko「Stay out of this. You don't even love her.」%K%P

0x8C4
Makoto「Y-You've already got plenty of other girls, you know...%NWhat about Saki? Why are you constantly hitting on her%Nif you don't even like her?!」%K%P

0x8D0
Okuhiko「You're just trying to take advantage of Haruka-chan's%Ngood will.」%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「Don't screw with me! You've just been jealous ever since%NHaruka and I made our promise, right? That's why you%Nchose Saki! Just what do you think Saki is?」%K%P

0x8E8
Haruka「Saki... Not Saki...」%K%P

0x8F4
Makoto「...!?」%K%P

0x900
Haruka「She's... always... stealing... from me...」%K%P

0x90C
Okuhiko「It's all right, Haruka-chan. Saki-chan has nothing to do%Nwith this. I don't care about her. I couldn't give a shit%Nabout her...!」%K%P

0x93C
A dry sound echoes.%K%P

0x950
Taken aback, we all turn towards the sound. Saki is%Nstanding frozen by the front door, carrying her basket.%K%P

0x95C
By her feet are tennis rackets, scattered about.%K%P

0x990
Saki「I... I'll be going now... Farewell.」%K%P

0x99C
Okuhiko「Y-You're wrong, Saki-chan. There's a reason for...!」%K%P

0x9C0
Saki begins to run away, and Okuhiko rushes after her.%K%P

0x9CC
She violently slaps Okuhiko's extended hand away. I%Nfrantically jump out of the front door.%K%P

0x9D8
At that time, Yuka and Kurumi return while laughing about%Nsomething.%K%P

0xA44
Saki throws the basket onto the staircase. She then%Nvexingly crushes it with her foot.%K%P

0xAB8
She crushes it! The sound of wood snapping is heard.%NThe basket has now broken apart. Plastic tableware%Nscatters everywhere.%K%P

0xAD8
Kurumi「Saki-san...!」%K%P

0xAEC
Yuka「Wh-What's wrong!?」%K%P

0xB2C
Yuka and Kurumi rush over to us, their expressions%Ncompletely changed.%K%P

0xB38
Saki won't calm down...%K%P

0xB44
Shit... What should I do?%K

0x1FE8
Hold her down with all my might.

0x1FF4
Persuade her to calm down.

0xB84
I restrain Saki's body with a full nelson. Despite this, she%Nstill tries to crush each of the tableware one by one.%K%P

0xB90
Makoto「Saki! Dammit, calm down!!」%K%P

0xBA4
Saki「Don't touch me!」%K%P

0xDDC
Saki sends me flying with tremendous strength. In a%Ndaze, I shrink back to the front door.%K%P

0xDE8
Saki glares at all of us. Alarmed, Yuka and Kurumi cling to%Neach other.%K%P

0xDF4
Okuhiko is trembling pathetically. As soon as I open my%Nmouth, Saki explodes.%K%P

0xE08
Saki「Don't talk until I say so!」%K%P

0xE24
Makoto「Saki, calm down! Getting angry and going on a rampage%Nwon't accomplish anything!」%K%P

0xE38
Saki「...」%K%P

0xE44
Saki looks at me. The anger in her eyes is still blazing like%Nan inferno.%K%P

0xE50
... Holy shit... Saki's face all boiled up in rage is truly%Nterrifying.%K%P

0xE5C
It's because of her strong feelings towards Okuhiko...%K%N

0xE68
It's obvious that she hates him for the heartbreak he%Njust put her through.%K%P

0xE74
Makoto「Saki... san. Please... calm down for now.」%K%P

0xE80
Makoto「Come on, this might just be a huge misunderstanding on%Neveryone's part. Maybe if we talk about it together, we%Ncan sort this out and say, 'Oh, so that's all it was' later%Non.」%K%P

0xE94
Saki「... Talk about this... together.」%K%P

0xEA0
Makoto「Yes, that's good. Let's do it. Right, Saki...」%K%P

0xEBC
I place a hand on Saki's shoulder... In that instant, Saki%Nviolently flings my hand off of her.%K%P

0xED0
Saki「Don't touch me like I'm your friend!!」%K%P

0xEDC
Saki's expression is even angrier than before. Did I just%Nadd fuel to the fire?%K%P

0xEE8
Saki「Hmph... Talk about it together? And just where the hell%Nwould we do that? I'm fed up of playing buddy-buddy%Nwith all of you!!」%K%P

0xEF4
I try to open my mouth to see if I can fix the situation, but%NSaki doesn't even let me do that.%K%P

0xF00
Saki「Don't talk until I say so!」%K%P

0xF1C
Yuka「What are you saying, Saki!?」%K%P

0xF30
Saki「Shut up, Yuka! Why don't you just go draw your little%Npictures like you did back then...!?」%K%P

0xF44
Yuka「... Saki!」%K%P

0xF84
Makoto「...!?」%K%P

0xF90
Saki glares at Okuhiko, whose shoulders shoot up with a%Nstart.%K%P

0xF9C
Kurumi runs over to Saki and clings to her.%K%P

0xFB8
Kurumi「Saki-san, stop! No... Kurumi doesn't want to see you like%Nthis...!」%K%P

0xFD4
Saki「Don't touch me!」%K%P

0x1030
In the next instant, Saki violently thrusts Kurumi away.%K%P

0x103C
She throws Kurumi right onto the stairs! Kurumi gasps%Nloudly, and stares dumbfoundedly at Saki.%K

0x2000
"Saki...! How could you...!?"

0x200C
Run over to Kurumi.

0x1084
Makoto「Saki...! How could you...!?」%K%P

0x1090
Saki「...」%K%P

0x109C
Saki's expression warps into shock. I think she probably%Nrealizes what she had just done.%K%P

0x10C0
Makoto「Kurumi-!」%K%P

0x10CC
I run over to Kurumi. Saki is in a daze, standing stock still.%K%P

0x111C
Just then, Haruka comes rushing down the terrace, and%Nquickly helps Kurumi up.%K%P

0x1130
The slender Haruka takes her hands and gently strokes%NKurumi's back.%K%P

0x1158
Haruka「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x1164
*Hic*. Kurumi begins to sob heavily.%K%P

0x1170
Haruka glares sharply at Saki.%K%P

0x1184
She stands up. She starts to get closer and closer to%NSaki.%K%P

0x1190
I automatically hold my breath.%K%P

0x11B8
Saki「Stay away from me.」%K%P

0x11C4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x11D8
Saki「What is it? Get the hell away from me! I have no business%Nwith you, you damn clone...!」%K%P

0x11FC
Haruka「―!」%K%P

0x1208
Makoto「―!」%K%P

0x1214
Okuhiko「―Ah...」%K%P

0x1220
Yuka「―Huh?」%K%P

0x122C
Kurumi「―Clone?」%K%P

0x1254
In that instant, it feels like the world has stopped.%K%P

0x1260
―She says Haruka's a clone.%K%P

0x126C
An existence created by using part of some person's%Ncells to artificially fertilize an egg.%K%P

0x1278
Duplication, so to speak.%K%P

0x1284
Copies...%K%P

0x1290
Haruka's a clone?%K%P

0x129C
I recall memories of Haruka from two days ago.%K%P

0x12A8
The Haruka who watched the water dripping from the%Nfaucet.%K%P

0x12C4
The Haruka who drenched her feet in the breaking%Nwaves on the beach.%K%P

0x12E0
Haruka's sweating face as she pedaled the bike.%K%P

0x12EC
The enthusiastic Haruka who forgot herself as much as%Nshe could when she went fishing with me.%K%P

0x12F8
The Haruka who asked me to kiss her. ―That face. That%Nblushing face.%K%P

0x1304
That same Haruka is a clone?%K%P

0x1310
I look at Haruka, her expression unwavered, as if she's%Naccepting it...%K%P

0x131C
Me and the others look at Saki with dubious eyes.%K%P

0x1330
Saki「I'm not lying. I know about it. I know...!」%K%P

0x134C
Okuhiko「... I can't believe it.」%K%P

0x1358
Saki「Why don't you look at her face? It's practically written all%Nover it.」%K%P

0x136C
Okuhiko「Ugh...」%K%P

0x1388
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x13A4
Saki「Do you understand, Okuhiko-kun? This is the true nature%Nof that girl you claim to love.」%K%P

0x13B0
Okuhiko「Suppose Haruka-chan is a clone... So what? Times have%Nchanged. Everyone knows that there's currently about%N1-2 clones for every 1000 human grade school kids.」%K%P

0x13BC
Yuka「Also, nine years ago, a law was passed that legalized%Nthe fertilization of clones.」%K%P

0x13C8
Okuhiko「That's right. Saki-chan, it'd be best not to say such trite%Nthings. This is something our generation sees as normal,%Nnot as something to be scorned.」%K%P

0x13DC
That's right. The existence of clones is legal.%K%P

0x13E8
In the past, those who created clones were accused as%Nhaving committed a grave sin, and the clones%Nthemselves were also persecuted by humans...%K%P

0x13F4
―But why?%K%N

0x1400
Okuhiko's and Yuka's defense sounded a bit off.%K%P

0x140C
It sounded empty. Forced.%K%P

0x1418
It sounded like Haruka was the first clone they'd actually%Nknown was a clone, so they just pulled whatever facts%Nthey had on hand to create a so-called "defense".%K%P

0x1424
Though... I'm no better. She's the first person I've known%Nwas a clone as well.%K%P

0x1430
Saki's whole body shakes as she opens her mouth.%K%P

0x1444
Saki「Splendid... What a splendid group of companions this%Nseminar has!」%K%P

0x1460
Yuka「Ah, wait, Saki...!」%K%P

0x1474
When she sees Saki begin to run, Yuka chases after her.%NThey head down the road towards the summer house.%K%P

0x1490
―I can't see Yuka anymore. She runs past us faster%Nthan a raging storm, leaving us stranded.%K%P

0x149C
An awkward atmosphere hangs in the air.%K%P

0x14A8
Though Okuhiko had said clones were not unusual in our%Nsociety, he still looked rather shocked.%K%P

0x14B4
The girl he liked is a clone. It's obviously not something%Nfamiliar to him, so of course he's bothered by it.%K%P

0x14C0
Kurumi continues to sob heavily. She probably still%Ndoesn't comprehend what had just happened.%K%P

0x14CC
I pick up the pieces of the broken basket.%K%P

0x14D8
I suddenly feel someone glancing at me, so I raise my%Nhead to find Haruka staring straight at me.%K%P

0x14EC
Makoto「Is... what Saki said earlier true?」%K%P

0x14F8
Haruka「That's why I have no heart...」%K%P

0x1504
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x1510
Haruka「Because I'm just somebody's replacement.」%K%P

0x151C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1528
Haruka「Because I'm nothing more than a copy.」%K%P

0x1534
Makoto「... That's not-」%K%P

0x1540
Haruka「Surprised?」%K%P

0x154C
Makoto「That's not true.」%K%P

0x1558
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1564
Makoto「That's not true...!」%K%P

0x1578
Haruka「I see...」%K%P

0x158C
Haruka quickly looks away from me, and slowly opens the%Nfront door. I automatically run after her.%K%P

0x1598
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0x15C8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x15D4
Makoto「Umm... how do I put this...」%K%P

0x15E0
Haruka「...」%K

0x2018
"Don't worry about it."

0x2024
"Honestly... I was a bit surprised."

0x1620
Makoto「... Don't worry about it. Whether you're a clone or a copy,%NHaruka is Haruka. Even if you don't have a heart.」%K%P

0x1634
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1648
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1654
Haruka becomes surprised and takes in a sharp breath.%K%P

0x1668
After that, I feel a little hesitant... After that... After that,%NI've run out of things to say.%K%P

0x167C
Haruka「... I'm happy.」%K%P

0x1688
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1694
Haruka「I'm happy to hear that from you, Makoto...」%K%P

0x16A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x16E0
She closes the door, the sound of her footsteps%Nfading...%K%P

0x16EC
I stand frozen in place.%K%P

0x16F8
I'm worried about Haruka's expression just now. She%Ndidn't look happy at all...%K%P

0x1714
Makoto「Honestly... I was a bit surprised.」%K%P

0x1720
Though my own words surprise me, I feel that I should be%Ncompletely honest.%K%P

0x172C
Haruka is waiting for me to continue.%K%P

0x1738
Makoto「I don't know much about clones, I admit.%K Since this is new%Nto me, of course I'm surprised. But... But you know...」%K%P

0x1744
I try to carefully choose my next words.%K%P

0x1750
Makoto「Even if you're a clone, Haruka is Haruka. Nothing has%Nchanged between us.」%K%P

0x1764
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1778
Makoto「... Nothing will change.」%K%P

0x1784
Haruka becomes surprised and takes in a sharp breath.%K%P

0x1798
Haruka「... I'm happy.」%K%P

0x17A4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x17B0
Haruka「I'm happy to hear that from you, Makoto...」%K%P

0x17C4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x17FC
She closes the door, her footsteps fading...%K%P

0x1808
I stand frozen in place.%K%P

0x1814
I'm worried about Haruka's expression just now. She%Ndidn't look very happy...%K%P

0x1870
I go to Saki's summer house. The chilly late afternoon air%Npierces my body.%K%P

0x187C
―After Haruka went inside, I calmed down the sobbing%NKurumi, and tried going to Haruka's room. I called out to%Nher many times, but she didn't leave her room.%K%P

0x1888
Did I say something wrong?%K%P

0x1894
I then became curious about Saki, who had suddenly%Nexploded in anger.%K%P

0x18A0
In the first place, how did she know that Haruka was a%Nclone?%K%P

0x18AC
I intend to get that answer out of her.%K%P

0x18B8
Just as I'm about to try opening the door, Yuka comes%Nout of from inside.%K%P

0x18CC
Makoto「Yuka! How's Saki doing?」%K%P

0x18D8
Yuka「Until she calms down, I don't think it'll be any good. It was%Nlike this in the past too.」%K%P

0x18E4
Makoto「In the past... you mean when you and Saki used to draw%Ntogether?」%K%P

0x18F0
Yuka「Huh? Well, I guess that's true... Anyway, how's Haruka?」%K%P

0x18FC
Makoto「She still hasn't left her room.」%K%P

0x1908
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x191C
I can't talk to Saki as she is now.%K%N

0x1928
We head back towards the lodge.%K%P

0x1960
Makoto「Hey, Yuka. Is there really that much of a difference%Nbetween clones and humans?」%K%P

0x1974
Yuka「Let's see... The only difference I see is how they're born.%NIf they're a copy of someone else's genetic information,%Nthen they're like a twin, right?」%K%P

0x1980
Makoto「But Haruka says that because she's a copy, she has%Nno 'heart'...」%K%P

0x198C
Yuka「I've never heard of normal clones ever saying that.%NThere's no way it's possible to not have a 'heart'...」%K%P

0x1998
Makoto「I agree. There's absolutely no way she doesn't have a%N'heart'.」%K%P

0x19A4
Yuka「Kinda feels like a delusion.」%K%P

0x19B0
Makoto「A delusion?」%K%P

0x19BC
Yuka「Like what if Haruka's convinced that she's some kind of%Nspecial being?」%K%P

0x19C8
Makoto「A special being...」%K%P

0x19D4
Yuka「Yeah. I have a hunch that she has held on to that%Ndelusion...」%K%P

0x19E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1A30
When we return to the lodge, we see Izumi-san jogging%Nup towards us.%K%P

0x1A3C
In her hand, she's carrying a bag full of some ingredients.%K%P

0x1A48
Izumi「Makoto-kun! Yuka-chan!」%K%P

0x1A54
Yuka「Izumi-san? What about the shop?」%K%P

0x1A68
Izumi「I closed it early. It's not like any customers would come%Nanyway. Ah, I'm sorry for troubling you with Kurumi,%Nespecially you, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x1A74
Makoto「Huh? No, uh... Sorry, please excuse me.」%K%P

0x1A88
I'm in no mood to talk to the unusually cheerful Izumi-san%Nright now.%K%P

0x1A94
Lightly bowing my head, I head back to my room.%NIzumi-san might think badly of me, but...%K%P

0x1AA0
Izumi「Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x1AAC
I can hear Izumi-san asking Yuka this from behind my%Nback.%K%P
