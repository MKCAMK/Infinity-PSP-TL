I know that Saki will be swallowed up by that monstrous%Nwave today.%K%N

0x15C
I have to find some way to prevent it...%K%P

0x168
When I think about it, it was because of this incident%Nwhen everything started going wrong...%K%P

0x174
Well, it's great and all that I've decided to try to prevent%Nit, but where do I begin and how?%K%P

0x180
In the end, I went with the flow along with everyone else,%Nand now we've finally arrived here.%K%P

0x18C
We walk to the pier while carrying our fishing rods. At this%Nrate, the result will be the same as last time.%K%P

0x198
No way...! I can't let that happen...!%K%N

0x1A4
Absolutely not...!!%K%P

0x1B0
Anyway, I need to stop Saki from going out towards the%Npier... No, before that, should I stop Saki and Haruka's%Nquarrel...?%K

0x8A8
Call out to Saki.

0x8B4
Call out to Haruka.

0x1F0
I call out to Saki.%K%P

0x20C
Makoto「Hey, Saki!」%K%P

0x23C
Saki「What?」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「Um...」%K%P

0x254
Makoto「Err...」%K%P

0x260
Makoto「Well...」%K%P

0x274
Saki「Geez, spit it out already.」%K%P

0x280
(D-Dammit...! I can't think of anything to say...!)%K%P

0x28C
Umm... What to say, what to say...%K%P

0x2B0
Yuka「Hey, Makoto?」%K%P

0x2E0
Just then, Yuka calls out to me.%K%P

0x2EC
Makoto「I'm a little busy right now!」%K%P

0x2F8
Yuka「I have something important to talk about.」%K%P

0x304
Makoto「I told you, I'm busy!」%K%P

0x310
Yuka「I have a bad feeling...」%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「I know that!」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「I told you... right now, I'm...」%K%P

0x344
I call out to Haruka.%K%P

0x350
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Would you like me to teach you how to fish?」%K%P

0x380
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「When it comes to fishing, I'm not the greatest, but I can%Nstill...」%K%P

0x3B0
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara!」%K%P

0x3E0
Okuhiko「You're getting way too friendly with Haruka-chan.」%K%P

0x3EC
Makoto「It doesn't concern you!」%K%P

0x400
Okuhiko「It does concern me!」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「Look, just piss off! I'm busy right now!」%K%P

0x418
Okuhiko「With what!?」%K%P

0x424
Makoto「Instead of wasting time with you, I could be...!!」%K%P

0x438
At that time, I hear the echo of Saki's voice. Saki and%NHaruka had started quarreling without me noticing. I%Nimmediately start running...%K%P

0x44C
Saki「AAAAAH!」%K%P

0x474
Saki screams at the same time as the booming roar of a%Nwave breaks out.%K%P

0x480
I didn't make it in time. The unbelievably large wave%Nstrikes the pier with a large sheet of water!%K%P

0x494
As it strikes, the wave devours Saki and drags her into%Nthe ocean!%K%P

0x4A0
I'm frozen in place.%K%P

0x4AC
(Dammit...)%K%P

0x4B8
(I couldn't prevent it... Even though I knew about it, I%Ncouldn't prevent it...)%K%P

0x4E0
Izumi-san runs and dives into the ocean off of the tip of%Nthe pier!%K%P

0x4EC
(Izumi-san...!)%K%P

0x508
(―No, she should be all right...)%K%P

0x514
... ... ...%K%P

0x558
In the end, Izumi-san saves her again.%K%N

0x564
I stand stock-still on the beach.%K%P

0x59C
(I tried to change this... I tried hard to change this...)%K%P

0x5A8
But the reality is that the incident happened again.%K%N

0x5B4
Then is it impossible for just my will to change history...?%K%P

0x60C
On the way back, everyone seems to be at ease.%K I%Nguess you could say that the tension in the%Natmosphere somehow unwinded.%K%P

0x618
Everybody seems to be relieved that everything turned%Nout all right.%K%P

0x624
The fiery, red sunset is also probably contributing to%Nthe reason why everyone's hearts are calming down.%K%P

0x630
However...%K However, I'm probably the only one still%Nanxious...%K%P

0x698
"How can I change history? Is it even possible?" ...%NThat's the question endlessly revolving in my mind.%K%P

0x6C0
When I get into bed, I can only continue thinking the same%Nthing.%K%P

0x6CC
I failed to prevent Saki from being swallowed up by that%Nmonstrous wave.%K%P

0x6D8
Still, it's not like this past is exactly the same as my%Nmemories of the one before...%K%P

0x6E4
No, in the first place, is it accurate to consider this the%N"past"?%K%N

0x6F0
After all, events you experience at points ahead in time%Nare not the "past", but the "future"...%K%P

0x6FC
Either way, it doesn't change that tomorrow will be a%Nchallenge. The day Haruka was revealed to be a clone...%K%N

0x708
I have to find some way to stop that from happening.%K%P

0x714
But can my will alone really change history...!?%K%P

0x720
Or is the future, being what it is, just something I cannot%Ncomprehend, and therefore cannot change...?%K%P

0x72C
I think as hard as I can, but I am unable to settle my%Ndisordered thoughts.%K%P

0x738
And then...%K And then, before I know it, I fall into a deep%Nsleep...%K%P
