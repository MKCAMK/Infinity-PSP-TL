Yuka「Gyahahahahahahaha♪」%K%P

0xA4
Yuka's laughter makes me feel uneasy.%K%P

0xB0
I whisper into Yuka's ear so quietly that only she can%Nhear me.%K%P

0xBC
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? You understand, right?」%K%P

0xC8
Makoto「Even by mistake, you mustn't say 'I want to eat toro'!」%K%P

0xD4
Yuka「Yeah, eye noe, eye noe!」%K%P

0xE0
Yuka strikes me hard on the shoulder.%K%P

0xEC
(Haah...)%K%P

0xF8
I loudly sigh.%K%P

0x104
And then...%K%P

0x120
Kurumi「Morning!」%K%P

0x12C
... Kurumi appears.%K%P

0x138
A thin film of hot milk rises to the surface of the mug in%Nher right hand.%K%P

0x14C
Yuka「Oh, Kurumi-tan... Hau ah yuu feelin'?」%K%P

0x158
Kurumi「Good! After Kurumi had a nap, she got completely better.」%K%P

0x164
Yuka「Ohhhh! Dash gud, dash gud, nahahahaha♪」%K%P

0x178
Yuka「Ah!!」%K%P

0x184
Yuka suddenly leans forward and points to the mug in%NKurumi's hand.%K%P

0x190
Sh-She's not planning on say saying that again, is%Nshe...?"%K%P

0x19C
Yuka「I have jusht come up wif shomefing amashing!」%K%P

0x1A8
Makoto「Yeah, yeah, when you cross Kurumi and milk, you get%N'Kurumilk'... now let's move on!」%K%P

0x1B4
I beat her to the punch to obstruct her...%K%P

0x1C0
... Well, that was what I'd planned, but it doesn't look like it%Nturned out the way I wanted...%K%P

0x1D4
Kurumi「Kyahahahahahahaha♪ Well done! That's great!」%K%P

0x1E0
Yuka「Gyahahahahahahaha♪ Makoto... yer too funee...♪」%K%P

0x1EC
It seems I completely failed...%K%P

0x1F8
Yuka「Yuu jusht meid a portmanteau...♪」%K%P

0x204
Yuka「Makoto, yer too much...♪」%K%P

0x210
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x224
It's clear that those two are completely alienated in their%Nown world.%K%P

0x230
I pick my ears and look at the ceiling, staring at the lamp%Nfor no reason.%K%P

0x23C
And then, when the long laughter finally ends...%K%P

0x258
Yuka「Haah...」%K%P

0x264
...Yuka lets out a big sigh, and suddenly looks mopey.%K%P

0x270
This is bad...%K%P

0x27C
This is really bad.%K%P

0x288
Yuka's definitely going to say it—that's what my%Nintuition is telling me.%K%P

0x294
I've got to turn this conversation in a different direction!%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「Ah, the weather's so good today!」%K%P

0x2AC
Makoto「Don't you think so too, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x2C0
Izumi「Huh? A-Ah... Yes. That's right.」%K%P

0x2CC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2D8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x2EC
Crap. The conversation's dead.%K%P

0x2F8
I need another topic...%K%P

0x304
As I think that...%K%P

0x310
Yuka「To... To... To...」%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「Wow♪ Saki, your ponytail is so cool and cute♪ Swish,%Nswish♪」%K%P

0x330
Saki「... The hell?」%K%P

0x344
Makoto「Ah! If you look closely, Haruka's eyes are like a rabbit's!%NBounce, bounce♪」%K%P

0x358
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「Okuhiko, umm... Falalalalalala〜♪」%K%P

0x380
Okuhiko「A-Are you all right, Ishihara?」%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「Um, umm... Let's see, let's see...」%K%P

0x3A8
Yuka「To... To... To...」%K%P

0x3B4
—Shit!%K%P

0x3C0
Yuka「To... To... To...」%K%P

0x3CC
Yuka「Tower.」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「?????」%K%P

0x3E4
Yuka「I wanna shee... de lighthoushe tower...」%K%P

0x414
Yuka「I wanna shee de lighthoushe tower!!」%K%P

0x420
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x43C
Kurumi「Then let's go see the lighthouse!」%K%P

0x458
Saki「But is there a lighthouse around here?」%K%P

0x46C
Kurumi「Yeah. There's one in Viewpoint Park.」%K%P

0x480
Kurumi「See? So why don't we go see it, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x49C
Yuka「Arright! ... Dash what I'd like to shay, but...」%K%P

0x4B0
Yuka「If ish jusht de too of ush goin', ish a little lonely...」%K%P

0x4C4
Yuka「So den, eberiwan...!」%K%P

0x4E8
Yuka「Whaddya fink, guysh! ... Hee hee♪」%K%P

0x554
Izumi「H-Huh...?!」%K%P

0x5A8
Izumi「No way...」%K%P

0x624
Izumi「No good. It seems the battery's dead...」%K%P

0x630
Izumi「Oh well... Shall we walk?」%K%P

0x644
Izumi-san says that as she begins to walk, naturally%Ntaking the lead.%K%P

0x650
Of course, I kept my mouth shut about the battery, and%Njust let nature take its course...%K%P

0x700
We arrive at the cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0x70C
Right now, Yuka and Kurumi are playfully chasing each%Nother around the lighthouse in Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0x718
The rest of us are still standing on the cherry blossom%Nroad, completely stunned.%K%P

0x724
This is Saki, Haruka, and Okuhiko's first time seeing these%Ncherry blossoms.%K%P

0x730
The three of them seem to be under an incredible sense%Nof awe.%K%P

0x73C
Izumi「'Express your feelings on the Cape of Affection, and%Ncarry out those feelings at the Cove of Love.'」%K%P

0x748
Izumi-san is at the edge of the cherry blossom road,%Nabsently watching Yuka and Kurumi run around the%Nlighthouse.%K%P

0x75C
Saki「Huh...? What's that?」%K%P

0x778
Izumi「It's an old tradition on this island.」%K%P

0x784
Izumi「If a man and woman confess their feelings for each%Nother under that lighthouse, it's said that their affection%Nwill bear fruit...」%K%P

0x798
... It's the story she told us on the last 2nd when we were%Nsitting in circle.%K%P

0x7A4
The old tradition about this lighthouse, and after that...%Nthe legend of the shrine.%K%P

0x7B0
Izumi-san quietly begins telling the story.%K%P

0x7BC
To be honest, hearing the same story twice is boring.%K%P

0x7C8
I feel bad for Izumi-san, but I pretend to listen to the%Nstory while thinking about something else...%K%P

0x858
Yuka...%K%N

0x864
She almost gave me a heart attack back there...%K%N

0x870
But, well... things turned out all right in the end...%K%N

0x87C
If we stay like this, Saki won't get swallowed up by the%Nwave.%K%P

0x890
—We changed history.%K%N%N

0x89C
Yuka and I were actually able to change it.%K%N

0x8A8
This fact cheers me up considerably...%K%P

0x920
... And then, Kurumi and Yuka come back while out of%Nbreath.%K%P

0x950
Kurumi「Hey, what were you talking about?」%K%P

0x96C
Saki「There's a shrine nearby.」%K%P

0x988
Okuhiko「Izumi-san was in the middle of telling us a rumor about%Nthat shrine.」%K%P

0x9A4
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x9B0
Okuhiko「Kurumi-chan, you've never heard of that shrine before?」%K%P

0x9C4
Kurumi「Nope. First time Kurumi's ever heard of it!」%K%P

0x9D0
Okuhiko「Well then, isn't that exciting?」%K%P

0x9DC
Kurumi's eyes light up.%K%P

0x9F8
Saki「Well then, Izumi-san, will you continue?」%K%P

0xA14
Izumi「Y-Yes...」%K%P

0xA20
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xA2C
Saki「Izumi... san?」%K%P

0xA38
Izumi「Umm...」%K%P

0xA44
Izumi「Where was I?」%K%P

0xA50
Saki「You were up to the part where you initially thought it was%Nnothing more than a myth.」%K%P

0xA5C
Izumi「I see... Yes, that's right. When I first heard that story, I%Nwas also doubtful. But then...」%K%P

0xAEC
Izumi-san... the instant Kurumi arrived, she suddenly%Nchanged.%K%N

0xAF8
This definitely also happened the last time we heard this%Nstory, if my memory serves me right...%K%N

0xB04
Kurumi, Izumi-san, and... the shrine.%K%N%N

0xB10
Could they be connected in some way...?%K%P

0xB90
Izumi「No way! Absolutely not!」%K%P

0xB9C
Izumi-san's shout abruptly brings me back to reality.%K%P

0xBB8
Kurumi「Huh, why not?」%K%P

0xBC4
Izumi「'Why not'!?」%K%P

0xBD0
Izumi「Weren't you listening, Kurumi? That story I told you just%Nnow wasn't a joke. Do you understand that?」%K%P

0xBDC
Kurumi「Kurumi understands... But... if we only look at it from a%Ndistance, then...」%K%P

0xBE8
Izumi「See, you don't understand. You don't understand at all!」%K%P

0xBF4
Kurumi「But...」%K%P

0xC00
Izumi「No buts! No means no!」%K%P

0xC0C
Izumi「All right? Do you understand?」%K%P

0xC20
Kurumi「Boo...」%K%P

0xCDC
We pass the time in Viewpoint Park idly.%K%P

0xCE8
One person admires the cherry blossoms in full bloom...%NAnother's thoughts turn to what lies beyond the sea...%K%P

0xCF4
... and yet another person frolics like an innocent child%Nwhile trying to claw their way up the lighthouse...%K%P

0xD00
And then, this setting sun...%K%P

0xD0C
Right now, the seven of us are lined in a row by the%Ncape's fence, watching the bright red sun as it sinks%Nbelow the horizon.%K%P

0xD18
Is it just my imagination, or does it feel like the sun's%Ndescending at a faster speed than usual?%K%P

0xD24
It's like a smoothly descending curtain.%K%P

0xD30
I feel a little reluctance to see it set and go away...%K%P

0xD3C
I casually examine the others.%K%P

0xD48
They really seem lively, their cheeks dyed pink from the%Nsetting sun.%K%P

0xD54
—I'll only change the bad events into good ones.%K%P

0xD60
That plan has been a splendid success so far.%K%P

0xD6C
In the end, Saki never fell into the ocean.%K%P

0xD78
Since she didn't fall into the ocean, it's very likely she%Nwon't get into a quarrel with Haruka either.%K%P

0xD84
If that happens, then only good memories will remain.%K%P

0xD90
And currently, at this very moment, a new good memory%Nhas been born.%K%P

0xD9C
Everything is advancing steadily and favorably so far...%K%P

0xE0C
We're treated to dinner at Lunabeach, and get back to%Nthe lodge past 9:00.%K%P

0xE18
I take a bath, brush my teeth, change into my%Nnightclothes, and lie down on my bed.%K%P

0xE24
Makoto「Aaah...」%K%P

0xE4C
As I yawn, Haruka suddenly enters my room.%K%P

0xE58
She didn't knock this time either.%K%P

0xE6C
Makoto「H-Haruka!? Wh-What's wrong?」%K%P

0xE94
Haruka「Umm...」%K%P

0xEA0
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0xEAC
Haruka「Makoto... can you fish?」%K%P

0xEB8
Makoto「Fish?」%K%P

0xEC4
In that instant, several memories float into my mind.%K%P

0xED0
Haruka and I going fishing...%K%P

0xEDC
Kissing her on the forehead under that sunset sky...%K%P

0xEE8
Yes. That's tomorrow—on the 3rd.%K%P

0xEF4
Makoto「Yeah! I'm great at fishing!」%K%P

0xF00
I answer cheerfully.%K%P

0xF0C
Haruka「Then... will you teach me tomorrow?」%K%P

0xF18
Makoto「Of course!」%K%P

0xF24
Haruka「Really?」%K%P

0xF30
Makoto「Really!」%K%P

0xF3C
Haruka「Definitely?」%K%P

0xF48
Makoto「Definitely!」%K%P

0xF54
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xF60
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0xF74
Haruka「Thank you.」%K%P

0xF80
Makoto「No, no... I haven't even taught you yet...」%K%P

0xF8C
Makoto「Isn't it too early to be thanking me?」%K%P

0xF98
Haruka「Yes... but... thank you.」%K%P

0xFA4
Makoto「... Well then, tomorrow?」%K%P

0xFB0
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0xFC4
Haruka leaves my room.%K%P

0xFD0
Come to think of it, she said last time that she had no%Nheart...%K%P

0xFDC
Does she still think that even now?%K%P

0xFE8
Even now??%K%P

0xFF4
No, that's a strange way of putting it.%K%P

0x1000
This is the past, after all...%K%P

0x100C
Well, either way, taking Haruka fishing doesn't sound bad%Nat all.%K%P

0x1018
Ever since that day, she grew more and more obsessed%Nwith fishing.%K%P

0x1024
I have to teach her that hobby again...%K%P
