I'm on the pier, leisurely dangling my fishing line.%K%P

0x178
Like the last time, Haruka constantly repeats the cycle%Nof catching a fish, then letting it go.%K%P

0x184
She stares at her fishing line with a delighted%Nexpression on her face.%K%P

0x190
Now that I think about it, Haruka's expression feels like%Nit's become much more happier than it was in the last%Nhistory.%K%P

0x19C
(... Why is that?)%K%P

0x1A8
The answer hits me; on the last 2nd, she had a quarrel%Nwith Saki at this pier.%K%P

0x1B4
But this time, that never happened... so Haruka might not%Nbe depressed as she was last time.%K%P

0x1C0
At any rate, her cheerfulness is helping me relax.%K%P

0x1CC
Ever since last night, my mind's been endlessly running%Naround in circles because of Izumi-san's words about%Nthe "remaining mysteries".%K%P

0x1D8
But thanks to this truly pleasant scene, I've almost%Nforgotten about that.%K%P

0x1E4
...%K%P

0x1FC
However, there's no way that I can keep thinking like that%Nand act so leisurely forever.%K%P

0x208
—I need to get the truth from Izumi-san quickly!%K%P

0x214
If I screw up my timing, then things could turn out the way%Nthey did yesterday.%K%P

0x220
(Right now, Kurumi and the others are playing tennis, so%NIzumi-san is probably alone at Lunabeach.)%K%P

0x22C
I gather my resolve, and talk to Haruka.%K%P

0x238
Makoto「Say, Haruka? I've got a little errand to take care of.」%K%P

0x25C
Haruka「An errand?」%K%P

0x268
Makoto「Yeah... I promised to meet up with someone today...」%K%P

0x274
Haruka「I still want to fish.」%K%P

0x280
Makoto「Okay. Just wait right here. I'll be back soon.」%K%P

0x28C
Haruka「How long is 'soon'?」%K%P

0x298
Makoto「About two hours, perhaps?」%K%P

0x2A4
Haruka「Two hours... I don't think you'd call that 'soon'.」%K%P

0x2B0
Makoto「Well, it certainly isn't 'soon', but...」%K%P

0x2BC
Haruka「It's fine... I don't mind...」%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「I'm really sorry about this.」%K%P

0x2D4
Haruka「You're going to meet with 'her', right?」%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x2EC
Haruka「The 'Professor'...」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Y-You're wrong! What are you saying, Haruka!?」%K%P

0x304
Haruka「It's all right, I won't tell anyone.」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「I'm telling you, you're wrong!」%K%P

0x31C
Haruka「Right...」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「Seriously, you're wrong.」%K%P

0x334
Haruka「Right...」%K%P

0x340
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x34C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「Anyway, I've gotta go now.」%K%P

0x364
Haruka「Right...」%K%P

0x370
Makoto「I'll see you later.」%K%P

0x37C
Haruka「Right...」%K%P

0x388
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Do you really understand?」%K%P

0x39C
Haruka「Yes. It's all right.」%K%P

0x3A8
Haruka「My lips are sealed.」%K%P

0x3B4
Makoto「Haah... oh brother...」%K%P
