Yuka and I have a light tennis match, and after we finish,%Nwe decide to talk about what we're going to do next.%K%P

0x94
Yuka「This is around the time when we went searching for the%Ntennis balls, right?」%K%P

0xA0
Makoto「Yeah, that's right... but we don't have time for that.%K We%Nneed to talk about what we're going to do after we meet%Nup with Haruka and Okuhiko soon.」%K%P

0xAC
Yuka「... And then you challenged me to a rematch...」%K%P

0xB8
However, Yuka keeps the talk strictly on tennis. Dammit...%Ndo you even listen to others?%K%P

0xC4
Makoto「Look, we don't have time for this now...」%K%P

0xD8
Yuka「Oh! And then we made our bet!」%K%P

0xE4
Ugh...%K I'd have preferred if she didn't remember that...%K%P

0xF0
Makoto「Ah... You remember the most trivial of things...」%K%P

0x104
Yuka「What's trivial!?」%K%P

0x110
Yuka「You're just saying that because you lost that match,%Nremember?!」%K%P

0x11C
Makoto「Yeah, yeah... Then, as promised, I'll do whatever you say,%Nso spit it out...」%K%P

0x130
Yuka「Hey! What's with that irresponsible tone of yours!」%K%P

0x13C
Yuka「I'll really make you do the craziest thing I can think of!」%K%P

0x148
Oh crap... I have a bad feeling about this...%K%P

0x154
Yuka「Let's see, let's see...」%K%P

0x160
Yuka is seriously thinking hard...%K%N

0x16C
D-Double crap...%K Now I have a REALLY bad feeling about%Nthis...!%K%P

0x190
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1A8
Suddenly, Yuka looks at my face.%K%P

0x1B4
Is it just me, or are her eyes somewhat blurred...?%K%P

0x1C8
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x1D4
Makoto「Y-Yes...?」%K%P

0x1E0
I am swallowed up by the atmosphere.%K%P

0x1F4
Yuka「If... If...」%K%P

0x200
Yuka seems to have a slight blush on her face.%K%P

0x20C
Yuka「If I were to say 'Kiss me...', what would you do?」%K%P

0x218
... ... ... ... What?%K%P

0x224
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x230
H-Hold on...%K%P

0x23C
HOLD ON!!!!!%K%P

0x248
How did things come to this?!%K%P

0x254
Makoto「Y-Yuka...?」%K%P

0x260
My voice has been turned inside out.%K%P

0x26C
I don't know why, but I'm thinking that this is a joke.%K%P

0x278
No, I want to believe she'll tell me that.%K%P

0x2A8
Yuka「Idiot! There's no way that I'd say that!!」%K%P

0x2B4
She'd laugh as she said it. ... But that's merely what I'd%Nhoped she say, not what she's actually doing.%K%P

0x2D8
After all, there's Izumi-san. ... I already have someone...%Nwho told me they love me!%K%P

0x2E4
But...%K%P

0x314
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x320
Yuka's eyes are serious...%K%P

0x32C
Huh...? Is she serious?%K%N

0x338
I feel like I could cry.%K%P

0x34C
Yuka「... Makoto...」%K%P

0x358
... It seems she's serious.%K%P

0x364
Why... Why is Yuka doing this now...?%K%N

0x370
Now I really want to cry.%K%P

0x37C
My heart is beating very fast.%K%P

0x388
Yuka's lips...%K%N

0x394
Yuka's small lips...%K%N

0x3A0
Yuka's soft, trembling lips...%K%P

0x3AC
Izumi-san's face and Yuka's face overlap.%K%P

0x3B8
I... I...%K

0x870
When petticoats woo, breeks may come speed.

0x87C
I have Izumi-san!

0x42C
I gradually... blank out.%K%P

0x438
Yuka... Yuka...%K%N

0x444
Before long... my shadow becomes one with Yuka's%Nshadow...%K%P

0x460
...%K%N

0x46C
... Did I... do... it?%K%P

0x480
(Izumi-san...!!)%K%P

0x48C
I clench my hands into fists, and barely manage to%Nsqueeze my voice out.%K%P

0x498
Makoto「I'm sorry... I... can't.」%K%P

0x4AC
Yuka's face is sad.%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「Um... it's not like... I hate you or anything, Yuka.」%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「It's just... well... I don't think we have that kind of%Nrelationship...」%K%P

0x4D0
I'm talking frantically, as if I'm desperately making an%Nexcuse to justify myself.%K%P

0x4DC
Yes, that's probably it... My heart's throbbing so much%Nbecause I feel guilty.%K%P

0x4F8
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x504
Yuka mutters this regretfully.%K%P

0x510
Makoto「I'm sorry... but that's... my final word on it...」%K%P

0x51C
I apologize once more.%K%P

0x54C
Yuka「Well then, what shall I have you do～...」%K%P

0x558
Yuka returns to her normal self as if nothing ever%Nhappened.%K%P

0x564
No, on the contrary, it kinda feels like she's forcing%Nherself...%K%P

0x570
It's very painful being with Yuka right now.%K%P

0x584
Yuka「Then let's do this!」%K%P

0x590
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x5AC
... Yuka presents me with this order.%K%P

0x5B8
"You must try my cooking one more time."%K%P

0x5C4
Oh God, help me...%K%P

0x604
I don't remember what happened after that.%K%P

0x610
Before I know it, I've met up with Haruka and Okuhiko.%K%P

0x61C
For some reason, I was lying sprawled on the banks of%NMoon Beach.%K%P

0x628
Did I start sleepwalking when I wasn't paying attention...?%K%N

0x634
No, I was probably just distracted with something else...%K%P

0x640
... Another strange thing happened too. ... Yuka's%Ncompletely back to normal.%K%P

0x64C
She's acting as if what happened earlier never%Noccurred.%K%P

0x6B0
After that...%K%N

0x6BC
We arrive at Lunabeach.%K%P

0x6C8
Kurumi, Izumi-san, and Saki show up one by one. They're%Nall putting on a remarkable spectacle, reenacting their%Nexchanges from last time.%K%P

0x6D4
The shop has a lot of rice this time, but I go out to buy%Nsome to keep up the act.%K%P

0x6E0
Izumi-san's paella is even better than last time, and I%Nalmost faint again.%K%P

0x6EC
So far, everything's been going well.%K%N

0x6F8
Okuhiko seems to completely be under the impression%Nthat today is April 1st, to the point where he no longer%Nshows any signs of doubting it.%K%P

0x704
(If he'd doubted it even the slightest, then this wouldn't%Neven be half as fun...)%K%P

0x710
Even I begin to think this way.%K%N

0x71C
And while all of this goes on...%K%P
