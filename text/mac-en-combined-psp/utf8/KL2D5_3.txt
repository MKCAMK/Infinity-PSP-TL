0x1B4
No, was it really?%K%P

0x1C0
Last night, Kurumi didn't tell me about her scar.%K%P

I've wanted to do this for all this time...%K%P

0x2EC
Because I'm behind her, I can't see Kurumi's expression.%K%P

0x2F8

0x364
Kurumi's back is burning hot.%K%P

0x370
That rough sensation on her back no longer seems sad.%K%P

0x37C
Kurumi's scar has become my own.%K%P

0x388
My chest melts into that small back, and they become%None.%K%N

0x620
Such a cheerful dinner...%K%N

0x62C
There's not a hint of gloominess in the room...%K%N

0x638
Not from Kurumi... or from Izumi-san...%K%N

0x644
... All of it is warm.%K%P

0x650
Izumi「By the way, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x65C
