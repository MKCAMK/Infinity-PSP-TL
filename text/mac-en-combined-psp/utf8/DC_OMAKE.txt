I'm in the middle of the ocean.%K%P

0x130
The sun in the blue sky shines on the azure sea...%K%P

0x13C
I can't see anything else.%K%P

0x148
I'm leaning against the ship's railing while enjoying the%Nspring sea breeze.%K%P

0x154
I look at the sea, and see its surface being cut to%Npieces by the bow of the speeding ship.%K%P

0x160
As a white sheet of water rises up, I see several%Ndolphins playing around the ship.%K%P

Saki「With what?」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「Didn't you say earlier that you planned to transfer from%NK University to our college in spring next year?」%K%P

0x22C
Makoto「There's too much of a difference in level between K%NUniversity and my college, isn't there...?」%K%P

0x240
Saki「Well, I've lost any interest I had in that university.」%K%P

0x24C
