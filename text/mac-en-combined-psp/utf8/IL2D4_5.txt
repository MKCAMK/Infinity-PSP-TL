When I come to, I'm in my bed in the lodge.%K%P

0x4C
(Why... am I here...?)%K%P

0x68
I touch my own lips.%K%P

0x74
Did I do it...? I can't remember.%K%P

0x80
But it feels like I did.%K%P

0x8C
Saki's lips still feel like they're touching mine.%K%P

0x98
If possible, I hope that I'm making some sort of%Nmisunderstanding.%K%P

0xAC
I touch my burning cheek.%K%P

0xB8
I'm pretty sure that there's still a vivid red color%Nengraved on it.%K%P

0xC4
I wonder if Saki is still angry?%K%P

0xD0
―And at that time!%K%P

0x100
Suddenly, a clamorous sound echoes, along with%NOkuhiko bursting into my room.%K%P

0x10C
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan's...」%K%P

0x118
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan's gone!」%K%P

0x170
Okuhiko gathers Yuka and I in the living room, and starts%Ngiving us the details.%K%P

0x198
Okuhiko「After that, I returned to the lodge, and took a shower.」%K%P

0x1A4
Okuhiko「I got out of the shower at about 9:30... and then, when I%Ntried going into Haruka-chan's room...」%K%P

0x1C0
Yuka「Haruka was gone...」%K%P

0x1CC
Okuhiko「Yeah...」%K%P

0x1D8
Okuhiko「Anyway, after that, I tried looking around the area%Naround the lodge on my own...」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「Hey, Okuhiko? What were you doing in Haruka's room in%Nthe first place?」%K%P

0x208
Okuhiko「What?」%K%P

0x21C
Yuka「... Now that you mention it, it is pretty weird...」%K%P

0x228
Okuhiko「Uh... that is... well... Right, the door was open. So when I%Nthought I should try to close it...」%K%P

0x234
Yuka「You stood in front of the door and found the room%Nempty?」%K%P

0x248
Okuhiko「Right, right...」%K%P

0x254
Makoto「Is that really what happened?」%K%P

0x268
Yuka「Anyway, sitting still here won't get anything solved...」%K%P

0x274
As she says this, Yuka stands up.%K%P

0x280
Yuka「... Why don't we all quickly split up and look for Haruka?%NWe should get Izumi-san and Saki's help.」%K%P

0x2F4
Yuka「All right? First, Makoto, you'll go call Izumi-san. Then, after%Nthat, go search the harbor, shopping district, and the%Neastern side of the island, okay?」%K%P

0x300
Makoto「Got it.」%K%P

0x30C
Yuka「Okuhiko-kun, do a thorough search of the area around%NMoon Beach!」%K%P

0x328
Okuhiko「Okay!」%K%P

0x33C
Yuka「I'll try searching Princess Beach, Viewpoint Park, and the%Nsouthern side of the island...」%K%P

0x348
Yuka「Saki, try searching around the lodge, one more time.」%K%P

0x35C
Saki「All right.」%K%P

0x378
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan, wait for me! I'll definitely find you!」%K%P

0x384
Makoto「Wait, Okuhiko... Maybe Haruka ran away because she was%Nfed up with being in your presence for too long.」%K%P

0x398
Okuhiko「Ishihara～! Why would you say something like that!?」%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「It's a possibility. We need to consider all possibilities in%Nthis situation, right...?」%K%P

0x3C0
Yuka「Well then, let's begin the search right away!」%K%P

0x3CC
Yuka「If you find her, return to the lodge immediately! Got it!?」%K%P

0x42C
I immediately head for Lunabeach.%K%P

0x438
Makoto「Izumi-san! It's time!」%K%P

0x44C
Izumi「Ah, yes, yes... Haruka-chan's gone now, right?」%K%P

0x458
After this bizarre exchange, we head for the shopping%Ndistrict.%K%P

0x4EC
We walk closely together through the silent, deserted%Nshopping district.%K%P

0x4F8
The date has already changed to "April 5th".%K%N

0x504
Of course, it's actually "April 10th"...%K%P

0x520
I suddenly look up, and see a starry sky spread before%Nme.%K%P

0x52C
It's a beautiful sky that's just like the one from the night%NIzumi-san confessed to me.%K%P

0x538
Finally... this is the time I was waiting for.%K%P

0x544
This is my best chance!%K%P

0x550
She confessed to me under a starry sky, so I'll answer%Nher under a starry sky too.%K%P

0x55C
I take in a deep breath before exhaling.%K%P

0x568
I gulp... and then quietly start talking.%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「Izumi-san... I...」%K%P

0x590
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x59C
Makoto「This time, I'll say it all without any interruptions...」%K%P

0x5B0
Izumi「Y-Yes...」%K%P

0x5BC
Makoto「Izumi-san... the truth is... I... I lov-」%K%P

0x5FC
Okuhiko「Heey! She's not here either!」%K%P

0x610
Okuhiko comes running over...%K%P

0x61C
(GODDAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)%K%P

0x628
(You were supposed to be searching the area around%NMoon Beach, weren't you!!!!?)%K%P

0x634
(So what the hell are you doing here!!!!?)%K%P

0x658
...%K%P

0x664
In the end, Izumi-san, Okuhiko, and I end up searching for%NHaruka.%K%P

0x670
(It's already over...)%K%P

0x67C
(All I want is to just end this all completely...)%K%P

0x6CC
After looking around once (or pretending to), everyone%Ngathers at Lunabeach.%K%P

0x6D8
Naturally, we haven't found Haruka (at least, that's what%Nwe're telling Okuhiko).%K%P

0x708
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan... where did you go?」%K%P

0x714
Okuhiko sounds miserable.%K He's completely exhausted.%K%P

0x720
Everyone else also looks tired.%K%N

0x72C
Very well, then it's time we reached the grand finale of%Nthis play.%K%P

0x738
Makoto「Hey, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x75C
Okuhiko「?」%K%P

0x768
Makoto「The truth is, there's just one place we haven't looked for%NHaruka yet...」%K%P

0x77C
Okuhiko「What!? Why didn't you say so earlier!?」%K%P

0x788
Makoto「N-Now, now, calm down...」%K%P

0x79C
Okuhiko「Say it! Hurry up and say it!」%K%P

0x7A8
Makoto「All right, all right...」%K%P

0x7B4
Makoto「The place we haven't looked yet is...」%K%P

0x7DC
Makoto「... The shrine!」%K%P

0x7E8
Makoto「To me... it seemed like Haruka had an interest in old%Nshrines and temples.」%K%P

0x7FC
Okuhiko「The shrine... You mean the one on that cape... that%NIzumi-san told us about?」%K%P

0x808
Makoto「Yeah... she's probably there.」%K%P

0x81C
Okuhiko「I see... so Haruka-chan's at the shrine!?」%K%P

0x828
Okuhiko「Wait for me, Haruka-chan!」%K%P

0x858
With that, Okuhiko begins to run away in a frenzy...%K%N

0x864
We see him off until he's no longer in sight.%K%P

0x870
...%K%P

0x88C
Makoto「Well then...」%K%P

0x8C8
Yuka「It's about time we got back now, isn't it?」%K%P

0x8F4
Saki「I agree. I'm so damn beat...」%K%P

0x910
Izumi「Shall I call Haruka-chan over?」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「You think so too, Izumi-san? All right, let's just live it up in%Nthe lodge for a bit until Okuhiko gets back...」%K%P

0x938
Yuka「Yaay～♪ Sounds good, sounds good～♪」%K%P

0x944
Makoto「But no alcohol for you, Yuka!」%K%P

0x958
Yuka「Whaaat!? Why not～!?」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「Do I even need to say it!?」%K%P

0x978
Before long, Izumi-san comes out with Haruka.%K%P

0x98C
Haruka「... Are we going back?」%K%P

0x998
Makoto「Yeah. With this, it's over...」%K%P

0x9B4
Makoto「It's all... over...」%K%P
