I realize that the rain has been pelting the window of my%Nroom without my noticing of it.%K%P

0x188
It's a terrible downpour.%K%N

0x194
The sound of rain irritates me for some reason.%K%P

0x1A0
How long will it be until the night ends?%K%N

0x1AC
I anxiously await the sunrise.%K%P

0x1B8
Feeling the urge to move, I jump off the bed...%K%P

0x1FC
I open the bent door, and enter the living room.%K%N

0x208
I want to check the eastern skies...%K%P

0x230
When I approach the window, I hear the cuckoo clock five%Ntimes in a row.%K%P

0x23C
As the bird chirps, I look out the window to find that the%Nwhole sky is grey.%K%P

0x248
Daybreak is near.%K%P

0x254
Knowing that makes me feel a little relieved.%K%N

0x260
That faint relief makes me feel drowsy.%K%P

0x26C
I haven't gotten a wink of sleep at all tonight.%K%N

0x278
Now I might be able to do so.%K%P

0x284
I'll go back to my room and try again...%K%P

0x29C
I briskly walk back in front of my room.%K%P

0x2B8
—Hmm?%K%P

0x2F0
I suddenly notice it.%K%N

0x2FC
The door to Yuka's bedroom, which is right next to mine...%Nis slightly ajar.%K%P

0x334
I quietly open it...%K%P

0x36C
—She's not here!!!%K%N

0x378
Yuka isn't here!%K%P

0x384
Her bed is completely empty.%K%P

0x390
There's a notepad on top of a white table near the%Nwindow...%K%P

0x3C8
"Dear Makoto..."%K%P

0x3D4
"I'm sorry. I'm going there."%K%P

0x3E0
"I have a reason that means I have to go there, no%Nmatter what. But you mustn't come after me!"%K%P

0x3EC
"If it's you, you'll understand, right? If you go there, the%Nsame thing will happen again in the end."%K%P

0x3F8
"History definitely won't change."%K%P

0x414
"That bet we made at tennis... remember it?"%K%P

0x420
"Since I won, you have to do any one thing I say."%K%P

0x42C
"Since I have that right... I'm going to use it now, okay?"%K%P

0x440
"You swore it, didn't you? 'I'll never again go back to the%Nshrine'..."%K%P

0x44C
"That's why, okay? Please... you mustn't come after me!"%K%P

0x478
"The Third Law of Professor Yuka's Love%NFormula:—Promises must be kept—"%K%P

0x484
"... Yuka."%K%P

0x51C
I rush out of the lodge.%K%P

0x528
I run through the furious rain, disregarding my%Nsurroundings.%K%P

0x534
—If I go there, won't history repeat itself?%K%P

0x540
But I instantly deny that. I won't falter.%K%P

0x54C
There's a possibility that Yuka might not have arrived at%Nthe shrine yet.%K%N

0x558
I've got to stop Yuka by any means necessary before%Nshe gets there.%K%P

0x590
Why, Yuka...?%K%P

0x59C
"I'll never come here again either..."%K%N

0x5A8
You said that, didn't you!?%K%P

0x5B4
Then why...!?%K%P

0x5C0
Today—in other words, the 6th—.%K%P

0x5CC
Even though you said that dream might have occurred in%Nthat shrine!%K%N

0x5D8
What's so important that you have to put your life at risk%Nand go there!?%K%P

0x5E4
As I run, I once again remember that scene...%K%P

0x63C
It can't be...%K%N

0x648
It can't be that that was Yuka?%K%P

0x654
Yuka said that she had—"a dream where someone%Ndied".%K%P

0x660
What if that was a lie?%K%P

0x66C
She said she threw the bell away at Viewpoint Park...%K%P

0x678
What if that was also a lie?%K%P

0x6D8
Before long, I've finally arrived at the shrine's staircase.%K%N

0x6E4
But Yuka isn't here either.%K%P

0x6F0
Damn...%K%N

0x6FC
I click my tongue in frustration.%K%P

0x708
So Yuka's already arrived at the shrine!?%K%P

0x714
I put all my strength into running up this staircase.%K%P

0x774
The rain pours down on the roof of the shrine, which is%Nsurrounded by white fog.%K%P

0x780
I look for Yuka.%K%N

0x78C
She's nowhere to be seen or found.%K%P

0x798
(Is she inside...?)%K%P

0x7A4
I run over to the front of the shrine.%K%N

0x7B0
But when I get there, I am once again seized with discord.%K%P

0x7BC
—Should I go in? —Should I stop here?%K%P

0x7C8
If I go in, won't I just repeat history?%K%N

0x7D4
But even if I stop now and I abide by Yuka's somewhat%Nquestionable words, there's no guarantee that this%Ntragedy won't happen!%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka「You're kind...」%K%P

0x7EC
Yuka said that under the tempest of stardust...%K%P

0x7F8
My chest grows hot, like it's burning.%K%P

0x804
"Definitely keep your promises."%K%P

0x810
That's right!%K%N

0x81C
There's no way I'm going to break my promise!%K%P

0x828
I made a vow to that starry sky!%K%N

0x834
—"I will definitely protect Yuka!"%K%P

0x840
No, but this isn't anything like a sense of duty.%K%N

0x84C
This is a much larger instinctive impulse than that. It's%Njust...%K%P

0x858
I don't... want to lose Yuka...%K%P

0x864
I kick off the ground with all my strength, and burst into%Nthe shrine.%K%P

0x8DC
However, Yuka isn't here either.%K%P

0x8E8
She's not here, but I spot something different almost%Ninstantly.%K%P

0x8F4
Light...%K%N

0x900
Light from outside is shining from behind the building%Nmodeled after a small Shinto shrine.%K%P

0x90C
I run towards the side of the building.%K%P

0x918
The rotting floor creaks loudly beneath my feet, as if it%Nwere about to break.%K%P

0x924
I notice that there's a wide space between the shrine's%Nwall and the back of the building.%K%N

0x930
Hidden behind the building is a small hole in the shrine's%Nwall that I wasn't previously aware of.%K%P

0x93C
It's a square hole that's big enough to let a single%Nperson get through it.%K%N

0x948
No doubt this hole was what caused the draft I felt two%Ndays ago.%K%P

0x954
I bend over, and slip through the small hole...%K%P
