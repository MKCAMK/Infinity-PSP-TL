Makoto「Hey, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x2C
I address him again.%K%P

0x40
Okuhiko「Yeah?」%K%P

0x4C
I'm bored; I might as well attempt to strike a conversation.%NHe seems interested enough.%K%P

0x58
Makoto「It's just... What exactly are we trying to achieve at this%Nso-called 'Seminar Camp' here?」%K%P

0x6C
Okuhiko「Ishihara, didn't you read the board?」%K%P

0x78
Okuhiko「It's 'an informal social gathering between each member%Nof each group'. That's what was written, right? In short,%Nwe don't have a goal.」%K%P

0x8C
Okuhiko「If we all get along and become friends, then it's all okay.」%K%P

0x98
Makoto「That's it? ... If that's the case, then don't you think that a%Nweek is too long for that?」%K%P

0xA4
Okuhiko「Don't fuss over minor details. I don't think this is so bad.」%K%P

0xB0
As if to emphasize his point, Okuhiko continues with this:%K%P

0xBC
Okuhiko「Don't you think so, Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0xC8
―Haruka!?%K%N

0xD4
―I see, so "Haruka" is that girl's name!%K%P

0xF8
Okuhiko「Don't you think so?」%K%P

0x104
Okuhiko gives Haruka an attempt of a smile that's%Nrefined, yet halfhearted.%K%P

0x110
Just then...%K%P

0x11C
Haruka「This smell... I hate it.」%K%P

0x128
... She suddenly speaks.%K%P

0x13C
Okuhiko「Huh??」%K%P

0x148
His jaw drops. I don't think he's used to being so utterly%Nignored.%K%P

0x154
Haruka「This smell...」%K%P

0x160
Haruka glares at the aluminum ashtray that I placed on%Ntop of the round table earlier.%K%P

0x174
Okuhiko「It's a cigarette... I see, so you hate the smell of%Ncigarettes, Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0x188
Haruka gives a slight nod.%K%P

0x194
Makoto「Now that you mention it, shouldn't the flames have%Nalready gone out a long time ago?」%K%P

0x1A8
Okuhiko「Ishihara～, do you really think that the smell of%Ncigarettes is something that simply disappears just like%Nthat?」%K%P

0x1B4
Okuhiko「A frequent smoker may not realize it, but a non-smoker%Ncan notice it instantly.」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x1CC
Okuhiko「You should be a little more careful so you don't bother%Nothers...」%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「H-Hey, hold on! I don't smoke!」%K%P

0x1EC
Okuhiko「Damn, you don't have a speck of decency, do you...?」%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「I-I'm telling you, it wasn't me!」%K%P

0x20C
Okuhiko「... Ha ha, don't try to fool us.」%K%P

0x218
Okuhiko「Let me ask you something... Who was the first person to%Nenter the room this morning?」%K%P

0x224
Makoto「I was... But when I came in, that ashtray was already%Nthere, on top of the sofa...」%K%P

0x230
Okuhiko「Oh-ho～... So that's it...」%K%P

0x23C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x250
Okuhiko「Well, I guess I can believe you...」%K%P

0x25C
Okuhiko「In return, I declare that from today onwards, the inside of%Nthe lodge is strictly a non-smoking area... You'll abide by%Nthat, won't you?」%K%P

0x268
(Damn it, you don't believe me at all!) Just as I'm about to%Nretort...%K%P

0x27C
... Haruka quietly stands up.%K%P

0x288
We watch in silent anticipation as she slowly takes the%Naluminum ashtray and walks towards the kitchen, just like%Nthat.%K%P

0x29C
Though I can only see her face in profile, I can clearly%Ntell that she's angry.%K%P

0x2A8
There's a cold, harsh glint in her eyes...%K%P

0x348
Yuka「Good morning!」%K%P

0x354
The Yuka who enters the living room looks like a%Ncompletely different person from before.%K%P

0x360
Her fixed up hair is now lightly bouncing, and she has%Nchanged out of her clothes into a neat, pink dress.%K%P

0x36C
But the biggest change is her face... She looks like an%Nexcited kid about to leave for a field trip.%K%P

0x378
For a second, our eyes meet. Remembering what%Nhappened this morning, I spontaneously break out into a%Nsmile.%K%P

0x38C
Still feeling a little embarrassed, Yuka breaks eye%Ncontact while playing with her hair.%K%P

0x398
Makoto「Good morning.」%K%P

0x3A4
Okuhiko「Hey there!」%K%P

0x3B0
Okuhiko returns her greeting as well.%K%P

0x3BC
Haruka, needless to say, doesn't reply at all.%K%P

0x3C8
Instead, she is now sitting quietly in a dining chair in%Nfront of the kitchen after having cleaned up the ashtray.%K%P

0x3DC
Yuka「Have any of you had breakfast yet?」%K%P

0x3E8
Yuka says this while turning her head to survey the%Nthree of us.%K%P

0x3F4
Makoto「No, not yet...」%K%P

0x408
Yuka「I see. Well then, I guess I'll make some.」%K%P

0x414
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x428
Yuka「What, is there something wrong?」%K

0x820
"Yuka, you can cook?"

0x82C
"That's not it... Do we have ingredients?"

0x470
Makoto「Yuka, you can cook?」%K%P

0x484
Yuka「... You're not doubting me, are you?」%K%P

0x490
Makoto「No... it's not like that...」%K%P

0x4A4
Yuka「Well then, there's no problem, right?」%K%P

0x4B0
Makoto「R-Right...」%K%P

0x4BC
Yuka and cooking...%K%P

0x4C8
For a while, I get lost in my fantasies as I connect the two%Ntogether.%K%P

0x4D4
A girl's cooking...%K%P

0x4E0
It's impossible to describe just how overjoyed I am as a%Nman by this situation.%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「Is there anything I can do to help?」%K%P

0x4F8
I try asking her this, as I feel like it's the right thing to do.%K%P

0x504
Yuka「Huh? No, it's okay. Just wait and watch some TV. I can do%Nthis all by myself!」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「That's not it... Do we have ingredients?」%K%P

0x524
Yuka「Oh, that's not a problem. The previous group left a bunch%Nbehind.」%K%P

0x530
Makoto「I see.」%K%P

0x53C
Yuka「I think it'll probably take about 15 minutes. Um, toast's%Nokay, right?」%K%P

0x548
Okuhiko gives her a quick nod as if to say "I'll leave it to%Nyou". I follow suit.%K%P

0x554
Yuka「What about you, Haruka?」%K%P

0x560
Yuka「Are you okay with toast as well?」%K%P

0x56C
Haruka gives her a slight nod, not taking her gaze off of%Nthe table's surface.%K%P

0x580
Yuka「Well then, I'll be done soon, so wait a bit.」%K%P

0x594
Yuka begins to go into the kitchen.%K%P

0x5A0
At that moment...%K%P

0x5AC
Makoto「Oh, that's right!」%K%P

0x5B8
... I remember something, and instantly try to draw Yuka's%Nattention.%K%P

0x5CC
Yuka「What is it?」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「There's something I'd like to ask you... do you smoke?」%K%P

0x5EC
Yuka「There's no way I'd do something like smoking...」%K%P

0x600
Yuka「If you look at my perfect skin, it's obvious～♪」%K%P

0x614
Yuka comically places her hands to her cheeks,%Nmuttering to herself in agreement as she enters the%Nkitchen...%K%P

0x620
If she didn't do it, then just who was it that smoked?%K%P

0x62C
Yuka, Haruka, Okuhiko... which one of those three is lying?%K%P

0x638
Makoto「Mmm...」%K%P

0x644
I moan in frustration.%K%P
