In the morning... I wake up, my head feeling kinda blank.%K%P

0x68
It might be because a whole lot of things happened%Nyesterday.%K%P

0x74
I'm in a dreamy state of mind, unable to sort things out in%Nmy head.%K%P

0x80
When I absentmindedly enter the living room, I find Yuka%Nwith a very sharp expression.%K%P

0x94
Yuka「Good morning.」%K%P

0xA0
Makoto「Morning... Where are Haruka and Okuhiko?」%K%P

0xAC
Yuka「They've already left.」%K%P

0xB8
Makoto「Both of them?」%K%P

0xC4
Yuka「Yes, both of them... Does it bother you?」%K%P

0xD0
Makoto「No... Just surprised that Haruka would be in the mood to%Ngo with Okuhiko...」%K%P

0xDC
Yuka「It seems that Okuhiko-kun is kinda serious about Haruka,%Nhuh?」%K%P

0xE8
Makoto「Serious? That's guy's a clear menace to women.」%K%P

0xF4
Yuka「Up until now, yeah. But if he seriously falls in love with a%Ngirl, then maybe she'll start to return his feelings.」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「Well, he's rich.」%K%P

0x10C
Yuka「That's not it. He just really understands women!」%K%P

0x118
Makoto「Ah ha... So Yuka... you like Oku...」%K%P

0x12C
Yuka「Idiot. It's not like that.」%K%P

0x140
Yuka「Anyway, what are you going to do from now on?」%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「Well... I'm a bit concerned about something...」%K%P

0x158
Yuka「You mean Saki...?」%K%P

0x164
Makoto「Well, yeah.」%K%P

0x170
Yuka「Why are you so concerned about her? She's just a...」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「Yuka, do you ever think you may simply be%Nmisunderstanding Saki?」%K%P

0x190
Yuka「If that's the case, the why don't you bring her here and%Nsolve the misunderstanding, huh?」%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「Hey, why are you mad...」%K%P

0x1B0
Yuka「Hurry up and bring her here.」%K%P

0x1BC
It seems Yuka's still upset about the barbecue%Nyesterday.%K%P

0x1C8
Our friendships are falling apart because of something%Nthis stupid...%K%P

0x1D4
Particularly Saki and Yuka's, who were old friends from%Nmiddle school.%K%P

0x1E0
If possible, I want the two of them to make up.%K%P

0x1EC
Makoto「All right, I understand. Then I'll go invite her over.」%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「... Will you wait for a bit?」%K%P

0x204
Yuka「Fine...」%K%P

0x218
I quickly head for Saki's summer house.%K%P

0x278
When I arrive at the front door, I hear sounds from the%Nbackyard.%K%P

0x284
Perhaps Saki might be there.%K%P

0x290
I circle around the house.%K%P

0x29C
Makoto「Yo, Saki!」%K%P

0x2CC
Saki「M-Makoto-kun...!」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「Can you come to the lodge now?」%K%P

0x2EC
Saki「... All right. I'll go later.」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Why? I have come here as your escort, Your Highness.」%K%P

0x30C
Saki「It's fine, just go ahead!」%K%P

0x318
Saki's acting strangely restless.%K%P

0x324
When I see that, I suddenly realize it.%K%P

0x330
Saki's waiting for that puppy...%K%P

0x33C
It will come here seeking breakfast...%K%P

0x348
I close in on Saki's ear and whisper this.%K%P

0x354
Makoto「So you're waiting for it?」%K%P

0x368
Saki「Huh!?」%K%P

0x374
Startled, she backs away from me and glares at me.%K%P

0x380
Makoto「I saw what happened last night. You gave it meat, didn't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x394
Saki「... You saw it?」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「It was cute.」%K%P

0x3AC
Saki「That was just... I dropped it on the floor, and just thought%Nit'd be a bit of a a waste, so I gave the beef to it.%NBesides... it's a really dirty puppy. It's not cu-」%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「No, when I said 'it was cute', I was talking about you, Saki.」%K%P

0x3CC
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「That puppy will definitely come again. It's become a sort%Nof habit for it, after all.」%K%P

0x3EC
Saki「I-If it comes again, then I'll just send it away. I don't want%Na stray dog clinging to me, you know.」%K%P

0x414
Makoto「... Oh, here it is.」%K%P

0x420
I hear rustling in the bushes, and then the puppy shows%Nup.%K%P

0x448
When it recognizes Saki, it dashes towards her.%K%P

0x454
And then, it jumps at her feet.%K%P

0x47C
It lively wags its tail as it begins to whine and beg.%K%P

0x488
It seems that it's completely attached to Saki.%K%P

0x494
It's obvious the puppy has known her for a long time.%K%P

0x4A0
Despite this, Saki stands stock still.%K%P

0x4AC
Now that she's said she "doesn't want it clinging to me,",%Nshe's reached the point where she can't back out.%K%P

0x4B8
Well, this is just typical of her...%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「I see. I thought there was something weird about the%Nwhole pizza thing.」%K%P

0x4D8
Saki「What are you talking about?」%K%P

0x4E4
Makoto「I'm talking about the day we met at Lunabeach. Kurumi%Nmade a mistake with the pizza delivery. You were%Nplanning on giving it to this little guy, right?」%K%P

0x4F0
Saki「No way...」%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「I thought you were really overreacting back then,%Ngetting so angry over a late pizza. Now I see that's also%Nbecause you wanted to feed this little guy...」%K%P

0x510
Saki「You're wrong!」%K%P

0x51C
Makoto「Furthermore, it took you six hours to go to complain for%Ncompensation. Why? Were you having so much fun%Nplaying with it that you didn't want to leave?」%K%P

0x528
Saki「You're wrong! That's not it!」%K%P

0x534
Makoto「All this time... you've been taking care of it way before we%Ncame to this island, haven't you?」%K%P

0x548
Saki「I said you're wrong, dammit! Didn't I tell you that I don't%Nwant this wild dog to be clinging to me!?」%K%P

0x554
Saki steps back and tries to run away from the puppy at%Nher feet. She waves her hand, as if to say "Shoo!"%K%P

0x560
The puppy innocently approaches Saki.%K%P

0x56C
When it does this, Saki gets desperate and tries to drive%Nit away with more force than last time.%K%P

0x578
Makoto「You don't have to hide it.」%K%P

0x58C
Saki「I'm not hiding anything!」%K%P

0x5A0
Suddenly, she crouches down. She picks the puppy up%Nand lightly throws it.%K%P

0x5AC
Saki「Shoo! Go away!」%K%P

0x5D4
The puppy misunderstands, thinking that Saki is trying to%Nplay with it. It happily returns to her feet.%K%P

0x5E0
Saki lightly throws it again.%K%P

0x5EC
The puppy returns to Saki.%K%P

0x5F8
Saki「Stay away from me! Leave now!」%K%P

0x604
She tries again and again to drive it away, but the%Npuppy always returns.%K%P

0x610
It gets so playful at times that it's starting to get Saki's%Nclothes dirty with mud and dust.%K%P

0x624
Saki「Go ahead to the lodge. When I've sent it away, I'll go%Nthere as soon as I can!」%K%P

0x638
Saki's eyes are faintly blurred as she says this.%K%P

0x644
As usual, the dog jumps up on her.%K%P

0x650
The puppy's muddy footprint get on Saki's chest. It's like%Nit's pressing a stamp on her...%K%P

0x65C
(All right...)%K%P

0x668
I just got a good idea.%K%P

0x674
In the first place, Saki is being too much of a hypocrite.%NAn occasional drastic measure is all right.%K%P

0x680
Makoto「Ah! Don't I... have to exact revenge?」%K%P

0x68C
I pick the dog up in my arms, and I lightly hit it several%Ntimes.%K%P

0x6E0
H-Huh? I'm going easy on it, but...%K%P

0x6F4
Saki「What the hell are you doing!?」%K%P

0x700
Saki's face turns pale when she hears the puppy's%Nscream.%K%P

0x70C
I gently let go of the puppy. The puppy runs away,%Nfrightened of me...%K%P

0x718
Saki tries to chase it, and it jumps on her chest, wiping%Nmore mud on it.%K%P

0x724
Makoto「I can't forgive any living creature that gets mud on you.」%K%P

0x730
Saki「But it's just a puppy, right!?」%K%P

0x73C
Makoto「I made a vow. It doesn't matter if it's a puppy or not!」%K%P

0x750
The puppy timidly comes back.%K%P

0x75C
I lightly kick it with my tiptoes...%K%P

0x784
... That was my intention, but the puppy is knocked down%Nfor a third time and lets out a sharp yelp.%K%P

0x7AC
Saki「STOP!!」%K%P

0x7B8
Saki holds the fallen over puppy in her arms. It's like a%Nmother protecting her child from a life-and-death%Nsituation...%K%P

0x7CC
The puppy cries into Saki's chest.%K%P

0x7D8
Saki turns around and looks at me. Her glare is sharply%Npiercing me.%K%P

0x7E4
Makoto「... N-No, it's just, I kinda lost my head back there, no,%Nthat's not it, uh, how do I put it...」%K%P

0x854
My excuses prove futile, as I receive a slap from Saki.%K%P

0x894
The Saki before my eyes is trembling with rage.%K%P

0x8A0
Saki「Go away! I don't want to see the face of someone who%Nwould be so cruel to this puppy!」%K%P

0x8B4
Still holding the dog, Saki runs into her house.%K%P

0x8C0
I stand frozen in place, dumbfounded...%K%P

0x8CC
My cheek is hotly stinging with pain.%K%P

0x940
When I return to the lodge, Yuka is waiting on the terrace.%K%P

0x980
Yuka「Judging by that face, you crashed and burned, huh?」%K%P

0x98C
Makoto「What, did the swelling give it away?」%K%P

0x998
Yuka「Huh? That's not what I meant, but... What, did she hit you?」%K%P

0x9A4
Makoto「Well, it was just some petty revenge...」%K%P

0x9B8
Yuka「Somehow, I thought that was the case. Saki hasn't%Nchanged from the past. She's selfish, and never%Napologizes even when she knows she's wrong.」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「Wait a minute! You've got it all wrong, it wasn't because of%Nthat. It was my fault that it happened.」%K%P

0x9D0
Yuka「It just sounds like you're spoiling her and letting her get%Nfull of herself.」%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「I'm telling you, that's wrong! You really are%Nmisunderstanding Saki.」%K%P

0x9F0
Yuka「You think so?」%K%P

0x9FC
Makoto「Of course.」%K%P

0xA10
Yuka「But Saki's still obsessed about the Magician's Portrait%Nincident.」%K%P

0xA1C
Makoto「Magician's Portrait?」%K%P

0xA28
Now that I think about it... didn't Saki said something to%NYuka on the 3rd...?%K%P

0xA34
"Shut up, Yuka! Why don't you just go draw your little%Npictures like you did back then...!?"%K%P

0xA48
Yuka「It was during our middle school culture festival. The%Nclass was drawing a picture called the Magician's%NPortrait. I wonder how long we drew it for?」%K%P「Anyway, it covered one of the walls of our classroom.%NEveryone divided the work by coloring their own portion%K%Pof it.」%K%P

0xA54
Makoto「Saki was in your class at the time?」%K%P

0xA60
Yuka「Yeah. You need a rough sketch before the coloring,%Nright? Saki and I each drew one. We disagreed over%Nwhich to use, so we left it up to a class vote.」%K%P

0xA6C
Makoto「So in the end, they picked yours, Yuka?」%K%P

0xA80
Yuka「Saki looked very bitter. She was almost scary to look at.%NThat's when, when it happened...」%K%P

0xA8C
Makoto「When what happened?」%K%P

0xAA0
Yuka「The completed painting was totally destroyed...%Nsomeone snuck into the school in the middle of the night%Nand did it!」%K%P

0xAAC
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0xAB8
Yuka「Everyone blamed her, though she insisted they were%Nwrong. Even though the homeroom teacher gave her a%Nwarning, she absolutely refused to apologize. And that's%Nnot all.」%K%P

0xAC4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAD0
Yuka「She told me, 'No matter what you draw, it'll never be called%Nart. But if you like drawing so badly, then go ahead and%Ndraw forever' ... She said that in front of the whole class!」%K%P

0xADC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAF0
Yuka「I didn't want to talk about that that incident, but... Saki's%Nbeen obssessed with it the whole time. That's why she%Nlunges at me whenever something happens.」%K%P

0xAFC
Makoto「... Did Saki really do it?」%K%P

0xB10
Yuka「It seems a janitor on patrol saw her running! I don't know%Nif Saki really did it, but she hasn't grown out of being so%Nstubborn.」%K%P

0xB1C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB28
Yuka「Argh, it's giving me a headache! Okay? Could you just%Nforget about the whole Saki thing?」%K%P

0xB34
Makoto「But, she's... Saki's really a nice person, right?」%K%P

0xB48
Yuka「I said to just forget about Saki!」%K%P

0xB54
Makoto「No, I can't!」%K%P

0xB68
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xB74
Makoto「Since before we came to this island, she's been taking%Ncare of this stray puppy the whole time.」%K%P

0xB80
Makoto「It's a very small puppy. She took the beef yesterday%Nbecause she wanted to give it to the puppy.」%K%P

0xB94
Yuka「... Well then, why didn't she just say that in the first pla-」%K%P

0xBA0
Makoto「She wouldn't. She's the kind of person who would never%Nsay that.」%K%P

0xBAC
Makoto「Don't you understand? It's part of that stubborn%Npersonality you were talking about...」%K%P

0xBC0
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0xBCC
Makoto「She really is a nice person.」%K%P

0xBD8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xBE4
Makoto「Destroying a picture... she's not the kind of person who%Ncould do that...」%K%P

0xBF0
Yuka「I get it...」%K%P

0xBFC
Yuka「I get it, so... will you call Saki here? One more time...」%K%P

0xC34
I give her a deep nod, and run down the short staircase.%K%P

0xC90
When I start walking towards Saki's summer house... I hear%Nthe cheerful voices of a man and woman.%K%P

0xC9C
When I look towards the forest path, I see Haruka and%NOkuhiko returning.%K%P

0xCA8
Over there, I see Haruka with an expression I've never%Nseen on her before.%K%P

0xCB4
An expression brimming with emotion... Up until now, I've%Nnever could have imagined such a human-like%Nexpression from Haruka.%K%P

0xCC0
To be honest, I'm shocked...%K%P

0xCCC
My mental state is like that of a a father who is watching%Nhis daughter with a boyfriend for the first time.%K%P

0xCD8
I probably feel something close to that.%K%P

0xCEC
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara. You're sure up late. You ought to rise early%Non beautiful days like this! Or maybe it's you they speak%Nof in 'In spring, one sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn.'」%K%P

0xCF8
Makoto「Shut up... I don't need your help!」%K%P

0xD0C
Okuhiko「Being jealous is unsightly for a man. You should try%Nacting a little cooler.」%K%P

0xD18
Makoto「Didn't I just say I didn't need your help!? Don't speak until%NI say so!」%K%P

0xD2C
Okuhiko「Oh? I guess this is where 'Those that lie down with dogs%Nshall get up with fleas,' applies, huh?」%K%P

0xD38
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0xD4C
Okuhiko「I recommend that you shouldn't get influenced so much%Nby hysterical rich girls, though it seems like she really%Npulled a number on you.」%K%P

0xD58
Makoto「What was that, Okuhiko!? Who did you hear that fr-...!?」%K%P

0xD74
I am taken aback when I notice Haruka's stare...%K%P

0xD80
Her glare coldly pierces me, even more unnerving now%Nthat her expression isn't its usual deadpan self.%K%P

0xD8C
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xDA0
Haruka suddenly averts her glare, slips past me, and%Nwalks up the stairs.%K%P

0xDAC
Okuhiko follows her lead.%K%P

0xDB8
I turn towards the departing Haruka, unable to say%Nanything.%K%P

0xDC4
A very unpleasant feeling grabs my heart, and I turn to%Ngo towards Saki's summer house once again...%K%P
