Could those be my words?%K%N

0xFC
Or... someone else's?%K%P

0x108
No, right now, it's doubtful whether these are even%N"words" or not.%K%P

There's nothing here.%K%N

0x120
No sound, no color, no wind...%K%N

It feels like I'm swaying around in a cloudy liquid.%K%P

0x138
It's so cold...%K%N

0x144
With every breath I take, my windpipe and lungs let out a%Ndry sound as if they're frozen...%K%P

0x1A4
That heavily dangling palm is clutching onto a small%Nfragment of light.%K%P

0x1B0
—A bell?%K%P

0x1BC
It's a small sphere... The smooth, metal surface shines as%Nit emits a cold light.%K%P

0x1C8
The bottom has a long, narrow hole carved into it, and a%Nsmall, dull crimson string is tied to the top.%K%P

Before long, the bell begins to quietly slip out of the%Npalm... It then...%K%P

I tearfully cling to her chest as my body's trembling%Ngradually intensifies.%K%P

0x258
In my arms, I can feel her cold, wet skin...%K%N

0x264
Her thin limbs are stiff...%K%P

0x270
Looking at her ghastly pale, almost transparent cheeks,%NI feel like she might shatter into a thousand pieces if I%Ntouched her cheek.%K%P

0x27C
As if she were a doll made of glass.%K%N

0x288
She has already stopped moving.%K%N

0x294
She doesn't speak or smile.%K%P

0x2A0
With her radiance and warmth completely gone, all that's%Nleft of her... is an empty shell.%K%P

0x2AC
A completely... empty shell.%K%P

0x2B8
Today is Saturday, April 6th, 2019.%K%N

0x2C4
—I've lost her.%K%P

0x2D0
(Why...?)%K%P

0x2DC
Only that hoarse voice fills this empty void...%K%P
