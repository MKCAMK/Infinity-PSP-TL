Haruka and I are on the pier, leisurely dangling our%Nfishing lines.%K%P

0x160
I've already taught Haruka everything I know about%Nfishing.%K%P

0x16C
Like the last time, Haruka constantly repeats the cycle%Nof catching a fish, then letting it go.%K%P

0x178
(If she continues to fish like this, then she'll be hooked in%Nno time.)%K%P

0x184
... That's what I think.%K%P

0x190
...%K%P

0x19C
Well then...%K%P

0x1A8
I look at my watch.%K%P

0x1B4
"3:23 P.M."%K%P

0x1C0
I've got to get going now.%K%P

0x1CC
When I slowly get up, I turn to Haruka.%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「Say, Haruka? I've... got a little errand to take care of.」%K%P

0x1EC
Haruka「Errand?」%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「Yeah... there's something I've got to confirm...」%K%P

0x204
Haruka「I still... want to fish.」%K%P

0x210
Makoto「Okay. Just wait right here.」%K%P

0x21C
Makoto「I'll be back soon...」%K%P

0x228
Haruka「How long... is 'soon'?」%K%P

0x234
Makoto「... About an hour.」%K%P

0x240
Haruka「All right.」%K%P

0x24C
Makoto「I'm really sorry about this.」%K%P

0x260
I apologize, leave her with all my gear, and head towards%Na certain place...%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「How's it going, Yuka? Did you find it?」%K%P

0x318
Yuka「Heh heh heh heh heh...」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x338
Yuka「Ta-da♪」%K%P

0x360
A bell is in Yuka's palm.%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「Phew... this makes two lifel...」%K%P

0x378
I try to say this, but then I notice something I didn't%Nearlier.%K%P

0x394
Right next to Yuka is Kurumi...%K%P

0x3A0
―Kurumi's here!?%K%P

0x3B4
Yuka「Kurumi-chan also helped out.」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x3D4
Kurumi「Yuka-san said it was a memento of her great-grandpa,%Nso...」%K%P

0x3E0
Kurumi「Kurumi looked very hard for it.」%K%P

0x3EC
Oh, I see... So that's how it is...%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「Were you the one to find it, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x40C
Kurumi「Yep♪」%K%P

0x418
Makoto「I see. You're a good girl...」%K%P

0x424
I pat her on the head.%K%P

0x438
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「Well then, I've got to go back now.」%K%P

0x458
Yuka「Right.」%K%P

0x464
Makoto「See you later...」%K%P

0x478
Leaving with those words, I turn around.%K%P

0x484
Just then...%K%P

0x490
... Yuka suddenly approaches me.%K%P

0x4A4
Yuka「Here...」%K%P

0x4B0
She whispers this very faintly into my ear.%K%P

0x4BC
While using her back as a wall so that Kurumi can't see,%NYuka puts something into my palm.%K%P

0x4C8
I feel a cool sensation... I don't even need to see it to%Nknow what it is.%K%P

0x4DC
Yuka「This is yours... right?」%K%P

0x4F0
Yuka says this, then gives me a light tap on my shoulder.%K%P

0x4FC
Kurumi「Hold on, you two... what are you doing?」%K%P

0x508
When she hears Kurumi's voice, Yuka jumps up and%Nmoves away from me.%K%P

0x524
Yuka「Nothing really. It's nothing, it's nothing.」%K%P

0x530
Kurumi「It's not nothing, is it? What you did just now was too%Nsuspicious!」%K%P

0x544
Yuka「You think so～?」%K%P

0x558
Kurumi「Of course!」%K%P

0x564
Kurumi scrutinizingly glares at us while furrowing her brow.%K%P

0x570
Makoto「Well then, see you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x584
At this rate, things are going to get troublesome. I%Ndecide to leave, and start to run away.%K%P

0x590
Kurumi「Ah! Wait a minute, Onii-chan!」%K%P

0x60C
When Kurumi's voice is out of earshot, I stop in the%Ncenter of the road to take a short rest.%K%P

0x618
Hopefully, Yuka will be able to lie her way out of that%Nsituation...%K%P

0x624
The only reason why I went all the way to Moon Beach%N(which should be so obvious that I don't have to say it,%Nbut whatever) was to make sure whether or not Yuka%Ncould find the other bell.%K%P

0x630
Right now, I have it.%K%P

0x63C
With this, we've been able to obtain both of our lifelines.%K%P

0x648
I reach into my pocket, as if to make sure it's still there.%K%P

0x654
All that's left is that day...%K%N

0x660
... As for the 5th and the 6th, if I keep an eye on Yuka the%Nwhole time, then nothing bad ought to happen.%K%P

0x66C
I feel a wave of relief wash through me as I walk briskly%Nback to the pier.%K%P

0x6F0
Haruka「Welcome back.」%K%P

0x6FC
Makoto「I'm back.」%K%P

0x708
Haruka「Have you finished your errand?」%K%P

0x714
Makoto「Completely.」%K%P

0x720
Haruka「I see...」%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「Did you catch anything?」%K%P

0x740
I sit down next to Haruka as I ask her this.%K%P

0x754
Haruka「Yes... a few.」%K%P

0x760
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x76C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x778
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x784
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x790
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x79C
Haruka「Have you ever kissed someone?」%K%P
