Before long, we arrive at Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0x80
Izumi-san is standing by the safety rail, gazing out at%Nthe ocean.%K%P

0x8C
The light sea breeze blows by Izumi-san, swaying%Nthrough her hair.%K%P

0x98
All I can hear around me is the calming roar of the waves,%Nwhich occasionally wash up against the bottom of the%Ncape.%K%P

0xA4
Izumi-san hasn't said a single word since we arrived at%Nthe park...%K%P

0xBC
(I don't get it... What is Izumi-san hoping to do by taking%Nme all the way to a place like this?)%K%P

0xC8
(I wonder if it would it be best after all if I just asked her%Ndirectly...?)%K%P

0xD4
I slowly approach Izumi-san.%K%P

0xF8
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x104
Makoto「Y-Yes...!?」%K%P

0x110
Izumi-san opens her mouth just as I stand right behind%Nher.%K%P

0x11C
Izumi「Even though we went through all this trouble to run here,%Nthe wind has just gone back from chilly to cold again,%Nhasn't it?」%K%P

0x128
Makoto「Y... You're right.」%K%P

0x134
It's true. All that sweat that I let off as I ran has become%Ncompletely chilled.%K%P

0x140
Izumi「But... as I thought...」%K%P

0x14C
(As I thought... what?)%K%P

0x158
Izumi「As I thought... today is...」%K%P

0x164
(Today is what?)%K%P

0x170
Izumi「It's a little cold, but as I thought, today...」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x190
Izumi「Today is the day the stars are at their most beautiful.」%K%P

0x19C
She lets out a sigh of awe.%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「Huh? The stars?」%K%P

0x1C4
Izumi「It's a good thing we came here, right?」%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「... Ah!」%K%P

0x214
A canopy of stars hangs above me.%K%P

0x220
The stars sparkle like shining gems on jet black velvet.%K%P

0x22C
No... not just gems... diamonds of the highest karat%Npossible... I've never seen anything so radiant in my%Nentire life.%K%P

0x238
This starry sky is truly captivating.%K%P

0x244
It feels like it's pulling my soul up towards the heavens...%Nlike it's drawing me up to the sky... That's how amazing it is.%K%P

0x250
Izumi「Thank you... for today.」%K%P

0x25C
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x268
Izumi「For Kurumi.」%K%P

0x274
Makoto「R-Right...」%K%P

0x280
Izumi-san slowly turns around.%K%P

0x294
Izumi「If you and the others hadn't been here... I might not have%Nfound her by now.」%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「No way... you're overexaggerating.」%K%P

0x2AC
I feel a bit embarrassed to receive such praise.%K%P

0x2B8
Makoto「Anyway, even if we didn't look, don't you think she still%Nwould have come back safe?」%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「Kurumi is surprisingly level-headed, after all...」%K%P

0x2D0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x2DC
Izumi-san hangs her head downwards.%K%P

0x2E8
What's wrong?%K Did I say something I shouldn't have?%K%P

0x2F4
Izumi「... Um, Makoto-kun...?」%K%P

0x300
Makoto「Yes...?」%K%P

0x30C
Izumi「Kurumi has quite the vagrant habits...」%K%P

0x318
Izumi「Occasionally, she'll suddenly go out, only to come back%Na little while later.」%K%P

0x324
Izumi「That's why... I was worried this time...」%K%P

0x330
Makoto「But she'd still come back on her own, right? I mean, she's%Ndone so up until now, hasn't she?」%K%P

0x33C
Izumi「Up until now... yes. But... But you know?」%K%P

0x348
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x354
Izumi「... No... it's nothing... Don't worry about it.」%K%P

0x360
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x36C
I can't bring myself to ask her what she means.%K%P

0x378
I feel that if I did, I'd be denying her smile.%K%P

0x394
Izumi「... Nevertheless, a lot of things have happened in the%Nlast four days.」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「You're right...」%K%P

0x3AC
Izumi-san and I then begin to talk as we recall everything%Nthat's happened so far.%K%P

0x3D4
—Kurumi delivering the pizza to our place by mistake.%K%N

0x3E0
—When I came to Lunabeach with the others.%K%N

0x3EC
—Saki coming in to yell and complain.%K%P

0x3F8
—When we all went to the pool.%K%N

0x404
—Going fishing with Haruka, and Saki's anger.%K%N

0x410
—Learning that Haruka was a clone.%K%P

0x41C
—The Test of Courage.%K%N

0x428
—The barbecue.%K%N

0x434
—And... about the others.%K%P

0x440
One by one, Izumi-san rattles off everyone's good and%Nbad traits.%K%P

0x44C
(She's been paying attention...)%K%P

0x458
I'm impressed.%K%P

0x464
I'm a biased person, so I wouldn't have been able to%Ndraw such objective conclusions.%K%P

0x470
Izumi「And then... there's you, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x47C
Finally, my turn has arrived.%K%P

0x488
Izumi「You have an excellent ability to take action... You%Nshowed that when you were searching for Kurumi.」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4A0
Izumi「But even though you're not stupid, you're bad at%Nunderstanding people's feelings...」%K%P

0x4AC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4B8
Izumi「Occasionally, your brief, trifling comments end up hurting%Nother people...」%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「R-Really...?」%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi「I think that's probably your greatest flaw.」%K%P

0x4DC
I don't really understand or accept that.%K%N

0x4E8
I don't understand other's emotions?%K%N

0x4F4
Really? I was trying to be understanding enough...%K%P

0x500
Makoto「You sound like an old person.」%K%P

0x50C
Izumi「It's not 'like'. I really am old.」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「Well, you're already 22 years old...」%K%P

0x524
Izumi「Ah! See, that's what I mean!」%K%P

0x530
Makoto「... Oh.」%K%P

0x53C
Izumi「It's comments like that that hurt everyone.」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x554
Izumi「Words can be the source of catastrophes... Well,%NMakoto-kun?」%K%P

0x560
Makoto「... I'll keep it in mind.」%K%P

0x56C
I had no idea... I had no idea that I was hurting others...%K%P

0x578
Having it being told to me so bluntly really is a shock.%K%P

0x594
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0x5A0
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x5AC
Izumi-san looks into my eyes.%K%N

0x5B8
I am unable to look away.%K%P

0x5C4
Izumi「But... it seems that in spite of that troublesome%Npersonality of yours...」%K%P

0x5D0
Izumi「I've fallen in love with you...」%K%P

0x5F8
My heart skips a beat.%K%P

0x604
Izumi-san's words go from my ears to my brain...%K%N

0x610
... And then, it feels like they're spreading all around my%Nbody via my nerves.%K%P

0x61C
Gradually, my blood starts to grow hotter and hotter.%K%P

0x628
Izumi-san... loves me!?%K%N

0x634
I didn't know...%K%N

0x640
I didn't notice it at all...%K%P

0x64C
Izumi-san said it earlier—"You're bad at%Nunderstanding people's feelings..."%K%N

0x658
Those words deeply pierce me in the heart like a dagger.%K%P

0x68C
Makoto「I'm sorry, Izumi-san... I...」%K%P

0x698
Makoto「I never... noticed your feelings...」%K%P

0x6B4
Izumi「You don't have to apologize.」%K%P

0x6C0
Izumi「I was the one who fell in love off on my own, after all...」%K%P

0x6CC
Izumi「... So please... For this short time, let me love you...」%K%P

0x6D8
Is this what it feels like... to be loved... by another%Nperson?%K%N

0x6E4
No, that might not be it.%K%P

0x6F0
I'm not being loved by a "person"...%K%N

0x6FC
—I might be being loved... by a "goddess".%K%P
