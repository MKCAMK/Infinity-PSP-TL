I quietly open the door, and enter the living room.%K%P

0xAC
The lights are on.%K%P

0xB8
But I don't see anyone, or hear anyone talking.%K%P

0xC4
Makoto「Then I'll go get a change of clothes.」%K%P

0xD0
Makoto「Oh, right... and maybe a shower while I'm at it...」%K%P

0xE4
Izumi「You're going to get wet on the way back anyway, so%Nwouldn't it be better if you took a shower at the shop?」%K%P

0xF0
Makoto「Yeah, you're right.」%K%P

0xFC
Makoto「Well then, just wait a minute.」%K%P

0x110
Leaving with those words, I head towards my room.%K%P

0x11C
When I look back, I see Izumi-san leaning on the front%Ndoor, waiting.%K%P

0x128
Her face looks flushed, like all the blood's rushed to her%Nhead...%K%P

0x134
(So she is a bit feverish after all...)%K%P

0x140
As I think this, I open the door to my room.%K%P

0x194
(...)%K%P

0x1A0
(...)%K%P

0x1AC
(...)%K%P

0x1C8
(... Huh?)%K%P

0x1DC
For some reason, Kurumi's there.%K%P

0x1E8
She's in the middle of changing her clothes.%K%P

0x1F4
Her back is turned to me, but all of her upper clothes are%Nraised over her head.%K%P

0x200
I can see her smooth... white back.%K%P

0x20C
—And immediately after that!%K%P

0x218
Kurumi「NOOOOOOOOOO!!」%K%P

0x224
Kurumi「Lech! Deviant! Pervert! Molester!」%K%P

0x230
Her screams finally bring me back to reality.%K%P

0x23C
I forcefully shut the door as I panic.%K%P

0x290
(Wh-Why was Kurumi in my room, changing her clothes...?)%K%P

0x2A8
(... Changing... her clothes...)%K%P

0x2B4
—What!?%K%P

0x2C0
... On Kurumi's back...%K%N

0x2CC
... there was...%K%N

0x2D8
... no scar...%K%P

0x318
Izumi「What's wrong, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x324
Having notice my change in behavior, Izumi-san comes%Nrushing over to me.%K%P

0x330
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x33C
But I'm unable to say the words.%K%P

0x348
This event has left my mind in a state of mass disarray.%K%P

0x354
(Calm down... calm down...)%K%P

0x360
(I have to think about this calmly...)%K%P

0x36C
(Calmly... calmly...)%K%P

0x378
But I don't get time to think.%K%P

0x3A0
With violent force, Kurumi comes bursting out of the room.%K%P

0x3C8
Kurumi「Geez, what were you thinking!?」%K%P

0x3D4
Kurumi「At least knock first...」%K%P

0x3F8
Kurumi「... Oh, Onee-chan.」%K%P

0x404
Kurumi「What's wrong, you two? How'd you get so soaked?」%K%P

0x410
Kurumi looks back and forth between me and Izumi-san's%Nfaces.%K%P

0x41C
Izumi「Hey, did something happen?」%K%P

0x428
Kurumi「'Did something happen'... What do you mean?」%K%P

0x434
Izumi「Just now, you screamed really loudly, didn't you?」%K%P

0x448
Kurumi「Ah, that's right!」%K%P

0x45C
Kurumi「Did you know? Umm, umm... Kurumi knows he peeked!」%K%P

0x468
Kurumi「He suddenly peeked at her while she was changing her%Nclothes!」%K%P

0x474
Izumi「Who peeked?」%K%P

0x480
Kurumi「'Who'? That's obvious, isn't it?」%K%P

0x48C
Kurumi quickly points at me...%K%P

0x4A0
Kurumi「—It was Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x4B4
Izumi「!?」%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x4CC
Izumi「... Makoto... kun?」%K%P

0x4D8
Izumi「Kurumi... why are you calling him 'Makoto-kun'...?」%K%P

0x4EC
Kurumi「Huh? Did Kurumi say something weird?」%K%P

0x4F8
Kurumi「Makoto-kun's the same age as Kurumi, so it's fine, isn't it?」%K%P

0x504
Makoto「'The same age'...?」%K%P

0x510
Kurumi「After all, Kurumi's ... twenty years old.」%K%P

0x524
Kurumi「She'll turn 21 this year, so until then, she's the same age%Nas Makoto-kun, right?」%K%P

0x540
At that instant... time stops.%K%P

0x54C
My body is frozen all over, feeling like it could shatter at%Nany second.%K%P

0x574
(The scar on Kurumi's back... has disappeared...)%K%P

0x580
(Her age is twenty... and the shrine is gone...)%K%P

0x58C
(Kurumi's past... has changed...)%K%P

0x598
(The history where she was kidnapped... has been%Nerased...)%K%P

0x5A4
(In this history...)%K%P

0x5B0
(—Kurumi was never kidnapped!)%K%P

0x5BC
I take a deep breath, but I can't exhale.%K%P

0x5C8
To say nothing less of my voice, which also won't come%Nout.%K%P

0x5D4
(Then—what about Haruka!?)%K%P

0x5E0
(—What about Haruka's existence!?)%K%P

0x5EC
(If Kurumi wasn't kidnapped, then...)%K%P

0x5F8
(If that "three year blank" never happened, then...)%K%P

0x604
(—Does that mean that Haruka—doesn't exist in%Nthis history!?)%K%P

0x618
I break into a run.%K%P

0x624
I throw open the door to Haruka's room with all my%Nstrength.%K%P

0x678
On the bed is...%K%N

0x684
... Okuhiko?%K%P

0x69C
Okuhiko is sleeping on the bed, snoring slightly.%K%P

0x6A8
(Why is Okuhiko in a place like this!?)%K%P

0x6B4
But right now, I don't have time to think about that.%K%P

0x6C0
I look around the room, but there's no sign of Haruka.%K%P

0x6CC
I turn around, and run into Yuka's room.%K%P

0x720
The instant I open the door, my nose is assaulted by the%Nstench of alcohol.%K%P

0x738
Yuka「Zzz...」%K%P

0x744
Yuka is widely stretched out on the bed.%K%P

0x750
Besides her are several empty beer cans, scattered%Naround her.%K%P

0x75C
Haruka's not in this room either.%K%P

0x7A4
I return to the living room, and frantically search%Neverywhere in the lodge for clues.%K%P

0x7B0
I look in the bathroom, the restroom, the kitchen, and the%Nloft, but Haruka is nowhere to be found.%K%P

0x7BC
(It can't be... Haruka can't really be...)%K%P

0x7C8
I stand stock still, and turn towards the other two.%K%P

0x7DC
Izumi-san clearly has no idea what's going on.%K%P

0x7E8
Kurumi looks scared of me because of my frenzied state.%K%P

0x7FC
I grab Izumi-san's hand, and rush out of the lodge...%K%P

0x8AC
I run down the hill road, which has become so slippery%Nfrom the rain that it feels like I'm rolling down it.%K%P

0x8CC
Izumi「Makoto-kun! What's going on!?」%K%P

0x8D8
Izumi「If you don't properly explain, then I can't understand!」%K%P

0x8E4
I come to a halt, and firmly grab Izumi-san's shoulders.%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「Haruka's... Haruka's... Haruka's...」%K%P

0x914
Izumi「Hey, calm down...」%K%P

0x920
Izumi「Just... what happened!?」%K%P

0x92C
Izumi-san's face is stiff from the extreme tension.%K%P

0x938
Makoto「The scar's... the scar's...」%K%P

0x944
Makoto「The scar on Kurumi's back has disappeared!」%K%P

0x958
Izumi-san is dumbfounded, her gaze piercing my eyes.%K%P

0x964
Makoto「There's no doubting it! I saw it with my own eyes!」%K%P

0x970
Makoto「There was no scar on Kurumi's back...」%K%P

0x97C
Makoto「It's all... my fault...」%K%P

0x988
Makoto「The disappearance of the bell, the disappearance of%Nthe cards, and the disappearance of the shrine.」%K%P

0x994
Makoto「It's all because of my thoughts...」%K%P

0x9A0
Izumi「Huh!? W-Wait a minute, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x9BC
Izumi「What do you mean by... 'the disappearance of the%Nshrine'?」%K%P

0x9C8
Makoto「I hid that from you... I didn't want to make you worried...」%K%P

0x9DC
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x9F0
Izumi「What do you mean, 'the disappearance of the bell'?」%K%P

0x9FC
Izumi「What do you mean, 'the disappearance of the shrine'?」%K%P

0xA08
Makoto「I hid them from you... I didn't want to make you worried...」%K%P

0xA1C
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0xA28
Makoto「I found the bell on the night of the 1st...」%K%P

0xA34
Makoto「I found it on Moon Beach, just like last time, and tried to%Nsmash it with a piece of concrete...」%K%P

0xA40
Makoto「But... when I flipped the concrete over...」%K%P

0xA4C
Izumi「... The bell... disappeared?」%K%P

0xA58
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xA64
Izumi「The bell... disappeared...」%K%P

0xA70
Izumi-san repeats herself.%K%P

0xA7C
She vacantly stares into space, motionless like stone.%K%P

0xA88
Izumi「Then what about the 'disappearance of the shrine'!?」%K%P

0xA94
Makoto「This afternoon... I went... down the same road... up the%Nsame stone staircase...」%K%P

0xAA8
Izumi「You went—to the Shiki no Mori Shrine!?」%K%P

0xAB4
Makoto「—But it was gone!」%K%P

0xAC0
Makoto「There was no shrine there!」%K%P

0xAE8
The rain continues to fall.%K%P

0xAF4
The cold rain mercilessly strikes down on us, slowly%Nsapping away our warmth.%K%P

0xB00
Makoto「... I... I...」%K%P

0xB0C
Makoto「I firmly thought about how I wanted to destroy that bell...」%K%P

0xB18
Makoto「I firmly thought that 'I absolutely don't want to play%Ncards'...」%K%P

0xB24
Makoto「When I touched Kurumi's scar—I firmly thought%Nthat—'This thing should just disappear!'」%K%P

0xB30
Makoto「I think the shrine disappeared for the same reason...」%K%P

0xB3C
Makoto「In order to erase Kurumi's scar... in order to erase that%N'three year blank'...」%K%P

0xB48
Makoto「I erased the existence of the shrine from this history!」%K%P

0xB54
"If The Third Trait's been proven, then I can erase that%Nthree year blank from history."%K%P

0xB60
Makoto「You said something like that at the pool last night, didn't%Nyou?」%K%P

0xB6C
Makoto「And that's... how it is...」%K%P

0xB78
Makoto「Everything's... my fault...」%K%P

0xB98
Izumi「Then in this history, Kurumi wasn't kidnapped!?」%K%P

0xBA4
Makoto「Yeah... that's why she said she was 'twenty years old'...」%K%P

0xBB0
Makoto「Because the 'three year blank' disappeared...」%K%P

0xBBC
Makoto「No, to put it more accurately, the 'three year blank' was%Nburied!」%K%P

0xBE0
Izumi「Such... such a thing...」%K%P

0xBEC
Makoto「I don't want to believe it, but it's all the truth!」%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「The bell disappeared, the shrine disappeared, the scar%Non Kurumi's scar disappeared...」%K%P

0xC04
Makoto「So the next thing that'll disappear is...」%K%P

0xC18
Izumi「—Haruka!?」%K%P

0xC48
We break off into a run again.%K%P

0xC54
We run as fast as we can, as if we're trying our hardest%Nto push our way through the pouring rain.%K%P

0xC60
The intense sound of the rainfall echoes in my trembling%Nchest...%K%P

0xD08
When we arrive at the coastline road, I speak to%NIzumi-san.%K%P

0xD14
Makoto「Izumi-san, you look around here! Check Princess Beach,%NViewpoint Park, Moon Beach...」%K%P

0xD38
Izumi「Yes, I understand...」%K%P

0xD44
Makoto「I'll go look around the harbor. I'm gonna borrow the bike%Nat the shop!」%K%P

0xD50
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xD5C
Izumi-san gives a deep nod.%K%P

0xD70
With that, I start running to the east, while Izumi-san%Nstarts running to the west.%K%P

0xDC4
Filled with determination, I kick off the wet asphalt as I%Ncontinue to run east.%K%P

0xDD0
While running in the darkness, I stare straight ahead, but%Nbecause of the heavy downpour, my field of vision is%Nvery limited.%K%P

0xDDC
Makoto「HARUKAAA!」%K%P

0xDE8
I shout, but my voice is drowned out by the roaring of%Nthe rain.%K%P

0xDF4
Suddenly, I trip on the wet road, but I block my fall with a%Nhand.%K%P

0xE00
I quickly get back up and continue to run.%K%P

0xE0C
There are no gaps between the raindrops. It's as if I'm%Nrunning through a flooding river.%K%P

0xE44
I finally arrive at Lunabeach.%K%P

0xE50
But I have no time to catch my breath.%K%P

0xE5C
I jump onto the bike parked on the side, and pump the%Npedals with all my strength.%K%P

0xE94
I pierce through the raining, heavy darkness like a%Nspeeding bullet...%K%P

0xEA0
The large raindrops beat against my whole body.%K%P

0xEAC
(... Haruka...)%K%P

0xEB8
(... Where is Haruka... right now...)%K%P

0xEF0
(... She couldn't have really... disappeared, could she...?)%K%P

0xEFC
(... Does Haruka no longer... exist in this world...?)%K%P

0xF34
(—No, that's wrong!)%K%P

0xF40
(—I won't accept such a ridiculous thing!)%K%P

0xF4C
(—Haruka is definitely here!)%K%P

0xF58
(—She's definitely... somewhere!)%K%P

0xF90
I hit the brakes, and get off the bike.%K%P

0xF9C
I stand in the middle of the pier, and look around.%K%P

0xFA8
She's not here...%K%P

0xFB4
Haruka isn't here either...%K%P

0xFC0
The crashing waves become a black fog that envelops%Nmy body.%K%P

0xFCC
The roar of the billows of waves that feel like they could%Nshake the earth echoes in the rain.%K%P

0x1030
... ... ...%K%P

0x10B8
I get back on the bike, and go back on the road.%K%P

0x10F0
The shopping district is like a ghost town...%K%P

0x1128
Although the wet road makes me lose control of the%Nhandles, I keep pedaling with everything I've got...%K%P

0x1160
I plow through the coastline road.%K%P

0x116C
The piercing cold rain has numbed all sensation in my%Nlimbs.%K%P

0x1178
But my legs don't stop.%K%P

0x1184
I keep on pedaling with all my might even though I'm out of%Nbreath.%K%P

0x11A0
—Then all of sudden!%K%P

0x11AC
A sudden curve appears in front of me!%K%P

0x11B8
I slam on the bike's brakes, but it's too late.%K%P

0x11C4
The rear wheel slips on the wet asphalt, and my body%Ngoes dancing in midair.%K%P

0x13E8
I roll on the water...%K%N

0x13F4
Before long, I land face-up...%K%N

0x1400
My body stops...%K%P

0x1418
...%K%P

0x148C
The rain falls.%K%P

0x1498
It comes falling endlessly from the black sky.%K%P

0x14A4
My hot breaths turn white, floating in the air.%K%P

0x14B0
My back has frozen.%K%P

0x14BC
Haruka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x14C8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x14D4
Haruka「Are you okay?」%K%P

0x14E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x14EC
As I lie sprawled out on the road, Haruka looks at me.%K%P

0x14F8
Makoto「... Haruka...」%K%P

0x1504
Haruka「... Hmm?」%K%P

0x1510
Makoto「... Haruka...」%K%P

0x151C
Haruka「... What?」%K%P

0x1528
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1534
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1540
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x154C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1564
Makoto「—H-HARUKA!!?」%K%P

0x1570
I spring up to my feet with a shout.%K%P

0x1604
Haruka「Wh-What's wrong, Makoto...?」%K%P

0x1610
I say nothing, and embrace Haruka.%K%P

0x161C
Haruka「Ma-Makoto...」%K%P

0x1628
My sudden action has left Haruka perplexed.%K%P

0x1634
I can hear the loud pounding of her heart in her chest.%K%P

0x1640
Haruka「H-Hey? Seriously... what's wrong?」%K%P

0x164C
Makoto「... No... it's nothing... it's nothing...」%K%P

0x1658
Makoto「It's just...」%K%P

0x1664
Makoto「I'm so happy...」%K%P

0x1670
Haruka「Huh?」%K%P

0x167C
Makoto「You're here...」%K%P

0x1688
Makoto「I'm so glad... that you're... here...」%K%P

0x1694
Our bodies are overlapping with each other...%K%P

0x16A0
I can feel warmth coming from Haruka's soaked body.%K%P

0x16AC
Haruka「I-I'm sorry... I don't really understand.」%K%P

0x16B8
Makoto「It's fine... it's all right if you don't understand...」%K%P

0x16C4
Makoto「All that matters... is that you're here...」%K%P

0x16D0
In my arms, the bewildered Haruka draws back a little.%K%P

0x16DC
I can feel her back faintly trembling.%K%P

0x16E8
Makoto「But what are you doing in a place like this? You don't%Neven have an umbrella...」%K%P

0x16FC
Haruka「Y-Yes...」%K%P

0x1708
Haruka「... Because I also... was happy...」%K%P

0x1714
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x1720
Haruka「... From... the rain...」%K%P

0x1734
Haruka says this, and looks up at the night sky.%K%P

0x1740
Her face is covered in transparent drops of water.%K%P

0x174C
A gentle smile rises to her face.%K%P

0x1758
In that instant, Haruka exudes a charming aura.%K%P

0x176C
Haruka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x1778
Haruka mutters this, and wraps her hand around my back.%K%P

0x1784
Haruka「Your chest... there's something mysterious about it...」%K%P

0x1790
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x179C
Haruka「It's warm... and gentle...」%K%P

0x17A8
Haruka「It feels like... I'm lightly floating...」%K%P

0x17B4
I gently stroke Haruka's wet hair with one hand.%K%P

0x17C0
Haruka glances up at my face...%K%P

0x17CC
She gives me an innocent, embarrassed smile.%K%P

0x1834
... ... ...%K%P

0x18E4
Haruka and I begin walking towards the west in the%Ndownpour.%K%P

0x18F0
Once Haruka goes back to the lodge, I have to look for%NIzumi-san...%K%P

0x18FC
Haruka enjoys bathing in the rain as I continue to push%Nthe bike.%K%P

0x1908
Before I know it, I've completely calmed down.%K%P

0x1914
But the moment I regain my cool, I feel pain in various%Nplaces over my body.%K%P

0x1920
It's probably because I fell from the bike earlier.%K%P

0x192C
In particular, I have throbbing pain on my right knee.%K%P

0x1938
Suddenly, I decide to look there...%K%P

0x1950
(Ugh...)%K%P

0x195C
My pants have torn at the knees, and I can see fresh%Nred blood gushing out of it.%K%P

0x1968
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Could you hold on to the bike for a minute?」%K%P

0x198C
Haruka「Huh?」%K%P

0x1998
Makoto「It seems I completely scraped my knee...」%K%P

0x19AC
Haruka「You're right...」%K%P

0x19B8
Haruka is firmly staring at my right knee.%K%P

0x19C4
I entrust the bike to Haruka, and try to check my wounds.%K%P

0x19E0
However...%K%P

0x1A10
The bike... falls...%K%P

0x1A30
Haruka「H-Huh?」%K%P

0x1A3C
Haruka「My hand seems to have slipped...」%K%P

0x1A48
Her hands slipped...%K%P

0x1A54
That's not what it looked like to me.%K%P

0x1A60
... What I did see...%K%P

0x1A6C
... when I entrusted the bike to Haruka...%K%N

0x1A78
... were the handles...%K%N

0x1A84
... apparently slipping right through...%K%N

0x1A90
... Haruka's hands...%K%P

0x1A9C
Haruka slowly bends over, and tries to pick up the bike.%K%P

0x1B18
The pouring rain looks like it's beginning to be soaked up%Nby Haruka's back.%K%P

0x1B24
Her figure looks like it's beginning to fade into the white%Nmist.%K%P

0x1B30
Makoto「... Ha... Haruka...」%K%P

0x1B3C
I gently stretch my hand out to try to touch her back.%K%P

0x1B54
—However!%K%P

0x1B68
Haruka「Ah!」%K%P

0x1B8C
Haruka gasps, and suddenly runs to the east.%K%P

0x1B98
My palm is left in midair, grasping at empty space.%K%P

0x1BA4
Haruka's back gradually gets farther and farther away...%K%P

0x1BB0
... Haruka's... back...%K%P

0x1BBC
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0x1BC8
I chase after Haruka, running as fast as I can...%K%P

0x1BD4
Haruka has stopped in the middle of the street,%Ncrouched over, trying to hold something in her arms.%K%P

0x1C6C
—It's Izumi-san!!%K%P

0x1C78
Izumi-san is collapsed on the wet road, completely limp.%K%P

0x1C84
I quickly run over to them.%K%P

0x1C90
I lift Izumi-san up into my arms, and shake her body.%K%P

0x1C9C
Makoto「Izumi-san! Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x1CA8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1CB4
Izumi-san has completely lost consciousness.%K%P

0x1CC0
Her body is burning hot.%K%P

0x1CCC
Her temperature is extremely high...%K%P

0x1CD8
(I've got to get Izumi-san back to the lodge...)%K%P

0x1CF4
Just as I try to stand up!%K%P

0x1D74
—A white light shines from down the road!%K%P

0x1D9C
It's the headlights of a car...%K%P

0x1DA8
I see a bright red car coming this way from the other%Nside of the curve, driving extremely fast.%K%P

0x1DE4
(—At this rate, Izumi-san will...!!!)%K

0x3E50
Take Izumi-san to the edge of the street!

0x3E5C
Stop the car!

0x1E44
(—At this rate, Izumi-san will...!!!)%K%P

0x1E50
I put my hands around Izumi-san's sides, and lift her%Nbody up.%K%P

0x1E5C
I try dragging her body to the edge of the road...%K%P

0x2064
... But I trip on something, and fall flat on the ground.%K%P

0x2070
Lying by my feet is that "fragment of concrete"...%K%P

0x207C
Makoto「!」%K%P

0x2088
I don't have time to speak.%K

0x3E68
I've got to move her!

0x3E74
Think of another way.

0x20C8
(... There must... there must be another way!)%K%P

0x20D4
My thoughts instantly begins to kick into high gear.%K%P

0x20E0
The car gets closer and closer.%K%P

0x20EC
It's moving as fast as a bolt of lightning.%K%P

0x20F8
(—Calm down! —Calm down and think!)%K%P

0x2104
—And as soon as I think that!%K%P

0x2118
(—At this rate, Izumi-san will...!!!)%K%P

0x2124
I put my hands around Izumi-san's sides, and lift her%Nbody up.%K%P

0x2130
I try dragging her body to the edge of the road...%K%P

0x2338
... But I trip on something, and fall flat on the ground.%K%P

0x2344
Lying by my feet is that "fragment of concrete"...%K%P

0x2350
Makoto「!」%K%P

0x235C
I don't have time to speak.%K%P

0x2368
The car gets closer and closer.%K%P

0x2374
It's moving as fast as a bolt of lightning.%K%P

0x2380
(—Calm down! —Calm down and think!)%K%P

0x238C
—And as soon as I think that!%K%P

0x2398
Haruka rushes out in the middle of the road!%K%P

0x23A4
She waves her hands widely as she boldly blocks the%Npath of the car!%K%P

0x23CC
Finally noticing her, the driver quickly slams the brakes.%K%P

0x23D8
The tires screech.%K%P

0x23E4
The car slides on the wet road...%K%P

0x23F0
It still hasn't slowed down.%K%P

0x2408
Haruka, standing in a spread-eagle position, is still%Nwaving her arms...%K%P

0x2414
Through the openings in her body, I see the red car is%Nstill approaching.%K%P

0x2420
Makoto「—Haruka!」%K%P

0x2498
Right then—%T030an unbelievable scene occurs%Nbefore my eyes.%K%P

0x24A4
Haruka's body is swallowed up into the body of the car.%K%P

0x24B0
It's as if she was a mirage... As if she was an illusion...%K%P

0x24BC
The car slips right through Haruka's body!%K%P

0x251C
The car approaches us with great speed...%K%P

0x2528
The lump of iron swoops down on us!%K%P

0x25E4
I'm hit with an impact so strong it feels like it could break%Nmy back...%K%P

0x25F0
My body is sent flying high in the air.%K%P

0x25FC
Izumi-san's body is lying on the road like a puppet%Nwhose strings have been cut.%K%P

0x2608
... ...%K%P

0x265C
Makoto「Haruka! I'll leave Izumi-san to you!」%K%P

0x2668
The instant I make my decision, I entrust Izumi-san to%NHaruka, and rush out into the middle of the road.%K%P

0x2674
"No matter what happens, I will protect Izumi-san to the%Nend!"%K%P

0x2680
(... Even if... it costs me my life...)%K%P

0x268C
I boldly block the path of the car.%K%P

0x2698
I wave my arms widely in order to catch the driver's%Nattention and alert them to the danger.%K%P

0x26A4
The car gets closer and closer.%K%P

0x26B0
It's moving as fast as a bolt of lightning.%K%P

0x26D8
Finally noticing me, the driver quickly slams the brakes.%K%P

0x26E4
The tires screech.%K%P

0x26F0
The car slides on the wet road...%K%P

0x26FC
It still hasn't slowed down.%K%P

0x2714
The body of the car before my eyes approaches me.%K%P

0x2720
As I stand in a spread-eagle position, I continue to%Nwidely wave my arms.%K%P

0x27DC
When I come to my senses, I'm dancing in midair.%K%P

0x27E8
The black, shiny road seems so distant.%K%P

0x27F4
Large raindrops are floating in the air.%K%P

0x2800
...%K%P

0x2A78
I fall onto the ground, crashing into it with enough force%Nto break my bones.%K%P

0x2A90
...%K%P

0x2AB8
Strangely, there's no pain...%K%P

0x2AC4
It's not just pain; I've lost all sensation throughout my%Nentire body.%K%P

0x2AD0
I try to stand up, but I'm not sure where or how to put%Nstrength in my body.%K%P

0x2ADC
I just barely manage to move my head.%K%P

0x2AE8
I can see bright red brake lights on from behind me.%K%P

0x2AF4
(That's right...)%K%P

0x2B00
(Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x2B0C
(Izumi-san's...)%K%P

0x2B18
I instinctively stagger to my feet.%K%P

0x2B24
I begin to walk towards the car while tottering.%K%P

0x2B30
It's a strange feeling, like I'm walking on air.%K%P

0x2B48
Soon enough...%K%P

0x2B5C
Haruka「—M-Makoto!? —Are you okay!?」%K%P

0x2B68
... I finally reach the two of them.%K%P

0x2B74
Haruka is sitting on the road, firmly holding Izumi-san in%Nher arms.%K%P

0x2B90
Haruka was trying to protect Izumi-san, with her back%Nfacing the car.%K%P

0x2B9C
There's only a mere 10 cm between Haruka's back and%Nthe car's bumper...%K%P

0x2BA8
I breathe a sigh of relief.%K%P

0x2BB4
Makoto「So... now what?」%K%P

0x2BC0
Haruka「Huh!?」%K%P

0x2BD4
Haruka「'Now what'... Makoto, are you really okay!?」%K%P

0x2BE0
Makoto「Yeah... this... is nothing...」%K%P

0x2BEC
Makoto「My knees... are even more scraped now, though...」%K%P

0x2BF8
Haruka looks up at my face with concern.%K%P

0x2C04
Just then...%K%P

0x2C10
Izumi「M-Mmm...」%K%P

0x2C38
Izumi-san slowly opens her eyes.%K%P

0x2C44
Izumi「... Ah... Haruka...」%K%P

0x2C58
Haruka「Onee-chan! Onee-chan! Hang in there!」%K%P

0x2C64
—What!? —Onee-chan!?%K%P

0x2C70
Izumi「I'm all right... I'm all right, Haruka...」%K%P

0x2C7C
Izumi「This is no big deal... at all...」%K%P

0x2C88
Haruka「But you've got this high fever...」%K%P

0x2C94
Izumi「... Fever? ... I don't have... a fever...」%K%P

0x2CA0
Izumi「I'm just hot... from running for a bit...」%K%P

0x2CAC
Haruka「Why!?」%K%P

0x2CB8
Haruka「What are you doing here, Onee-chan!?」%K%P

0x2CD4
Izumi「Because... I was worried...」%K%P

0x2CE8
Izumi「... About you... Haruka...」%K%P

0x2CF4
Izumi-san cries in the downpour.%K%P

0x2D00
Endless tears are overflowing out of her vacant eyes.%K%P

0x2D0C
Her tears sometimes dissolve in the rain...%K%P

0x2D28
Haruka「... Onee-chan...」%K%P

0x2D34
Haruka wipes the tears off Izumi-san's cheek with her%Npalm.%K%P

0x2D40
Her touch is soft and kind...%K%P

0x2D54
The two of them are wrapped up in the clean,%Ntransparent raindrops.%K%P

0x2D7C
The car door opens.%K%P

0x2D94
The driver hesitantly walks over to me.%K%P

0x2DA0
Driver「Umm... Err...」%K%P

0x2DAC
Driver「... Are you... all right?」%K%P

0x2DB8
I silently reach my hand out to give him a pat on the%Nshoulder.%K%P

0x2DC4
He gets flustered, and awkwardly averts his gaze as he%Nmoves back.%K%P

0x2DD0
He looks over at the other two, who are embracing...%K%P

0x2DDC
The rain gracefully falls.%K%P

0x2DE8
It's as if it's also embracing them, softly and gently...%K%P

0x2E1C
Makoto「... H... Huh...?」%K%P

0x2E28
Makoto「... That's... strange...」%K%P

0x2E34
Makoto「... My... vision's...」%K%P

0x2E40
Makoto「... becoming... blurry...」%K%P

0x2E4C
—Suddenly, I lose my strength.%K%P

0x3054
My knees give way, and I fall to the asphalt.%K%P

0x3060
Haruka「—Makoto!」%K%P

0x306C
Izumi「... Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x3078
Their voices sound distant.%K%P

0x3084
(... But... I'm glad...)%K%P

0x3090
(... Everything's... turned out well...)%K%P

0x309C
(... I... was able...)%K%P

0x30A8
(... to... protect... Izumi... san...)%K%P

0x3130
My vague consciousness is fading... Everything before%Nme begins to turn white...%K%P

0x313C
I can vaguely see something faint...%K%P

0x3148
There's that fragment... of concrete...%K%P

0x3154
And beyond it... I see a coldly shining... silver... light...%K%P

0x3160
(... What the... Tha...t's...)%K%P

0x316C
In that instant, my consciousness fades...%K%P

0x31C0
"No matter what happens, I will protect Izumi-san until the%Nend!"%K%P

0x31CC
I stand up again.%K%P

0x31D8
With my feet firmly on the ground, I pick up Izumi-san's%Nbody.%K%P

0x31E4
The car is getting closer and closer.%K%P

0x31F0
It's moving as fast as a bolt of lightning.%K%P

0x31FC
(—This is bad!)%K%P

0x3208
—The instant I think that!%K%P

0x3214
Haruka rushes out in the middle of the road!%K%P

0x3220
She waves her hands widely as she boldly blocks the%Npath of the car!%K%P

0x3248
Finally noticing her, the driver quickly slams the brakes.%K%P

0x3254
The tires screech.%K%P

0x3260
The car slides on the wet road...%K%P

0x326C
It still hasn't slowed down.%K%P

0x3284
Haruka, standing in a spread-eagle position, is still%Nwaving her arms...%K%P

0x3290
Through the openings in her body, I see the red car is%Nstill approaching.%K%P

0x329C
Makoto「—Haruka!」%K%P

0x3314
Right then—an unbelievable scene occurs before my%Neyes.%K%P

0x3320
Haruka's body is swallowed up into the body of the car.%K%P

0x332C
It's as if she was a mirage... As if she was an illusion...%K%P

0x3338
The car slips right through Haruka's body!%K%P

0x3398
The car approaches us with great speed...%K%P

0x33A4
The lump of iron swoops down on us!%K%P

0x33B0
(If nothing else, I have to at least save Izumi-san's life!)%K%P

0x33BC
—In that instant, I kick off the ground with all the%Nstrength I have!%K%P

0x3478
The car smashes right into my flank with enough force to%Nbreak it...%K%P

0x3484
My body is sent flying forward...%K%P

0x3490
But I don't dare let go of Izumi-san...%K%P

0x349C
I firmly embrace her body...%K%P

0x34A8
Doing my best to protect her, I land on my back...%K%P

0x3730
I receive the full impact of the crash...%K%P

0x373C
... ...%K%P

0x3764
Strangely, there's no pain...%K%P

0x3770
It's not just pain; I've lost all sensation throughout my%Nentire body.%K%P

0x377C
I try to stand up, but I'm not sure where or how to put%Nstrength in my body.%K%P

0x3788
My body is lying face up... On top of me is Izumi-san.%K%P

0x379C
Izumi「... Ma-Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x37A8
Izumi-san puts her hands on the road, and looks at my%Nface.%K%P

0x37B4
From her expression and tear-choked voice, I can tell%Nthat Izumi-san is all right.%K%P

0x37C0
(... I... Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x37CC
I try to mutter this...%K%P

0x37D8
But instead of words coming out of my mouth...%Noverflowing blood comes out instead.%K%P

0x37E4
It flows from my mouth and begins to dissolve in the%Nwater...%K%P

0x37F0
I try to crawl over to Izumi-san's side, as if my body's not%Nlistening to what it's being told.%K%P

0x3804
Izumi「Makoto-kun! Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x3810
Izumi「Hang in there, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x381C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3850
Izumi「Why... Why...」%K%P

0x385C
Izumi「Why did you... protect me...?」%K%P

0x3868
Makoto「... Because...」%K%P

0x3874
Makoto「... I...」%K%P

0x3880
Makoto「... love%T030... yo%T015... u...」%K%P

0x38A4
Izumi「No! I don't want this!」%K%P

0x38B0
Izumi「... Makoto-kun... you can't die...」%K%P

0x38BC
Izumi「—Because I love you!」%K%P

0x38C8
Izumi「Because I love you too, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x38D4
Her voice... sounds distant...%K%P

0x393C
My vague consciousness is fading... Everything before%Nme is begininng to turn white...%K%P

0x3948
I slowly... close my eyes...%K%P

0x3954
(... But... I'm glad...)%K%P

0x3960
(... I... was able...)%K%P

0x396C
(... to protect Izumi-san... until the... end...)%K%P

0x3978
In that instant, my consciousness suddenly ceases...%K%P
