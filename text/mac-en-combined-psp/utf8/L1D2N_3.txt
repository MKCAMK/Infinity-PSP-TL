We then walk towards the lodge.%K%P

0x70
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara!」%K%P

0x7C
Makoto「What is it?」%K%P

0x88
Okuhiko「You'll come with me, right?」%K%P

0x94
Makoto「Where?」%K%P

0xA0
Okuhiko「Isn't it obvious!?」%K%P

0xAC
Okuhiko「To see Saki.」%K%P

0xB8
(Why me? You're the one who was invited.)%K%P

0xC4
... However, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about Saki.%K%P

0xD0
Well then, what should I do...?%K

0x9A0
Don't go.

0x9AC
Go.

0x110
Makoto「This has nothing to do with me.」%K%P

0x11C
Makoto「If you're going, then go alone.」%K%P

0x130
Okuhiko「You're such a cold bastard.」%K%P

0x13C
Makoto「Besides, aren't you the one Saki has a thing for?」%K%P

0x148
I smirk as I tease Okuhiko, jabbing his shoulder mockingly%Nwith my finger.%K%P

0x15C
Okuhiko「I'm not good at these kinds of things.」%K%P

0x168
Makoto「I see. Sucks to be you, then.」%K%P

0x174
I walk away and leave Okuhiko behind with those%Nsarcastic words.%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「Sure, why not?」%K%P

0x1EC
I guess I'll go with him to the clinic.%K%P

0x1F8
Besides, I'm a little curious about what happened%Nbetween her and Haruka...%K%P

0x204
As we begin walking away, Kurumi follows us.%K%P

0x220
Kurumi「Okkun, Kurumi has something good to tell you.」%K%P

0x22C
Okuhiko「Hmm? What is it, Kurumi-chan?」%K%P

0x238
Kurumi「It seems Saki-san thinks Okkun is the one who rescued%Nher from the sea.」%K%P

0x244
Okuhiko「Huh?」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「Hey, but it was Izumi-san who...」%K%P

0x264
Kurumi「It's fine, forget about her.」%K%P

0x270
Makoto「But if Izumi-san hears about this, she'll get angry.」%K%P

0x284
Kurumi「Just forget about Onee-chan, okay!?」%K%P

0x298
Okuhiko「It's all right. It's not your fault she left you behind at the%Nclinic, even though you didn't want to.」%K%P

0x2AC
Kurumi「Right, right? See Okkun, you do understand.」%K%P

0x2B8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2CC
Kurumi nods to herself as she heads back to%NLunabeach again...%K%P

0x348
The closed shopping district is cold and deserted,%Nmaking it feel like a ghost town.%K%P

0x354
I would never have imagined walking alone with Okuhiko in%Nmy entire life...%K%P

0x360
Anyway, it's unusual for Okuhiko to invite me along.%K%N

0x36C
If he's bringing me, a guy, along, he must be planning%Nsomething.%K%P

0x378
Sure enough, Okuhiko starts to talk to me.%K%P

0x38C
Okuhiko「Ishihara. Before Saki-chan fell into the ocean, did you%Nknow she was arguing with Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0x398
Makoto「Yeah, it wasn't like Haruka at all...」%K%P

0x3A4
Okuhiko「You want to know what Haruka-chan was saying too,%Nright?」%K%P

0x3B0
Makoto「Have you tried asking Haruka?」%K%P

0x3BC
Okuhiko「You're thickheaded. It's more important to sympathize%Nwith her instead of asking directly, right?」%K%P

0x3C8
Makoto「What? By 'sympathize', you mean you're going to ask%NSaki, right?」%K%P

0x3D4
Okuhiko「No way. There's no way I would ask her.」%K%P

0x3E0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x3EC
Okuhiko「That's what you're here for.」%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x414
I see. So that's what he had up his sleeve.%K%N

0x420
As I thought, he's a selfish bastard.%K%P

0x42C
However, I don't go as far as say it to his face.%K%N

0x438
Either way, I just want to check up on Saki.%K%P

0x4AC
Kurumi was right.%K%N

0x4B8
Saki completely believes it was Okuhiko who saved her%Nlife.%K%P

0x4C4
He isn't even denying it. On the contrary, he's embracing%Nthis.%K%N

0x4D0
What a despicable bastard...%K%P

0x4E4
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara, isn't that right?」%K%P

0x4F0
What the hell's up with that "Hey"? It's like he thinks we're%Nbest friends.%K%N

0x4FC
However, after I ignore him for the umpteenth time, he%Nfinally stomps his foot.%K%P

0x508
(I get it. I get it, for God's sake...)%K%P

0x514
It's clear he wants me to ask about what happened with%NHaruka.%K%P

0x520
Makoto「By the way, what were you talking to Haruka about at%Nthat time?」%K%P

0x52C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x540
Okuhiko「Huh? At that time? Haruka-chan? What are you talking%Nabout?」%K%P

0x554
I try to ignore the urge to punch Okuhiko in the face.%K%P

0x560
Makoto「Just before the monstrous wave hit, you were talking%Nwith Haruka, right? After that, you ran all the way towards%Nthe tip of the pier...」%K%P

0x56C
Saki「U-Um... did you hear something from Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0x578
Makoto「No, but I was just a little curious.」%K%P

0x584
Saki「It was nothing...」%K%P

0x590
It seems that Saki's not in the mood to answer...%K

0x9B8
Keep pressing her.

0x9C4
If she doesn't want to talk, then forget it.

0x5D0
Makoto「It sure didn't look like it was nothing. After all, you%Npractically pushed Haruka off of you!」%K%P

0x5DC
Saki「I never did something like that.」%K%P

0x5E8
Makoto「You did.」%K%P

0x5F4
Saki「I didn't. Goddammit, I didn't do something like that!」%K%P

0x600
Makoto「What were you talking about, then?」%K%P

0x60C
Saki「Nothing... we weren't talking about anything at all!」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「You're lying.」%K%P

0x624
Saki「Wh-What's with you!? Why are you talking like that? Do%Nyou have a grudge against me or something?」%K%P

0x630
Makoto「It's nothing like that at all.」%K%P

0x63C
Saki「Then what do you want!?」%K%P

0x648
Makoto「I want to know the truth...」%K%P

0x65C
Okuhiko「Ishihara, back off. Quit interrogating her.」%K%P

0x668
Makoto「D-Damn you...」%K%P

0x67C
Okuhiko「Leave right now. You're terrible, pestering a wounded%Nwoman.」%K%P

0x688
Makoto「A wounded woman... But Saki's injuries aren't even all that%Nserious, are they?」%K%P

0x694
Okuhiko「You're rubbing salt in her heart's wounds. Can't you%Nunderstand that much?」%K%P

0x6A0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6BC
Makoto「... If you don't want to talk, then I won't force you to do so.」%K%P

0x6C8
Saki「Well then... All's well, isn't it...?」%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6E0
Saki「What!? What is it!?」%K%P

0x6EC
Saki「Why are you looking at me with those eyes!? What do%Nyou want from me?」%K%P

0x6F8
Makoto「It's not like I'm trying to pester you... I just want to know%Nthe truth.」%K%P

0x704
Saki「...」%K%P

0x710
Makoto「You weren't your normal self at the pier. I was worried...」%K%P

0x71C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x728
Makoto「I was worried. For you... and Haruka.」%K%P

0x734
Saki「!!」%K%P

0x740
Makoto「Saki...?」%K%P

0x74C
Saki「... Get out.」%K%P

0x758
Makoto「Huh?!」%K%P

0x764
Saki「Get out! Get the hell out of here!!」%K%P

0x770
Makoto「Saki... what's wrong?」%K%P

0x784
Okuhiko「Leave right now. You're pissing her off.」%K%P

0x790
Makoto「H-Hey, Okuhiko...」%K%P

0x79C
Makoto「... This was... your ide―」%K%P

0x7B0
I defensively raise my voice.%K%P

0x7BC
At that time, I look at Saki.%K%N

0x7C8
She's clinging to Okuhiko's arm, leaning on him while%Ntrembling as if she's relying on him.%K%P

0x7D4
I must sound ridiculous right now. There's no way I can do%Nsomething like have a direct conversation with her like%Nthis.%K%P

0x7F0
Saki「Get out!」%K%P

0x828
I storm off, leaving the clinic without a word.%K%P

0x834
This whole thing has left a sour taste in my mouth.%K%N

0x840
Damn you, Okuhiko... You'll regret this...%K%P
