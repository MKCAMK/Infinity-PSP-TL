Yuka「This is the life... isn't it?」%K%P

0x4C
Yuka and I are sitting down in two deck chairs by the%Npoolside, watching kids innocently playing in the water.%K%P

0x58
Yuka「The refreshing sound of water and the cheering of%Nchildren... The warm sunlight, and some first-rate draft%Nbeer...」%K%P

0x7C
That's right. Right now, she has a glass of draft beer on%Nher lips, drinking down the pure white foam from the top%Nof the glass.%K%P

0x88
Even after telling me that I was nuts for drinking beer%Nduring the day... You damn hypocrite!%K%P

0x9C
That's right. Right now, she has a glass of draft beer on%Nher lips, drinking down the pure white foam from the top%Nof the glass.%K%P

0xB0
Yuka「Hey? Don't you think so?」%K%P

0xBC
As she asks me for agreement, I grip a glass cup in my%Nright hand, filled with flat soda.%K%P

0xD8
To make matters worse, my soda is so flat that it's more%Nlike water...%K%N

0xE4
No matter how I think about it, this is not a situation where%NI can empathize with her.%K%P

0xF8
In other words, thanks to Yuka, I'm stuck with this flat%Nsoda that's more like water.%K%P

0x104
No matter how I think, this is not a situation I can%Nempathize with her with.%K%P

0x110
Yuka「It'd be nice if it continued to go on like this forever...」%K%P

0x11C
Yuka「It'd be nice if we could keep on living as though we were%Nwandering in a dream like this...」%K%P

0x138
Makoto「But if this really did go on forever, don't you think you'd%Neventually get bored?」%K%P

0x144
Yuka「Is that what you think?」%K%P

0x150
Makoto「Yes.」%K%P

0x15C
Yuka「But for now, I'd love to stay here as long as I wanted%Nuntil I get bored.」%K%P

0x168
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x17C
Yuka「Once this Camp is over, school will start again right%Naway, won't it?」%K%P

0x188
Yuka「Back to boring classes and a boring job... Those%Nordinary days that make me want to scream...」%K%P

0x194
Yuka「To me, that world is incredibly tedious.」%K%P

0x1A0
Makoto「Well, you might have a point there...」%K%P

0x1AC
As I say this, Yuka delicately places her cup to her lips...%K%P

0x1D0
... And gulps it down.%K%P

0x1DC
She's chugging it faster than a sailor.%K%P

0x1E8
(Is she all right?)%K%P

0x1F4
I become a little worried.%K%P

0x278
Okuhiko「Shalom!!」%K%P

0x284
Makoto「Whoa!!」%K%P

0x2C4
Okuhiko's sudden appearance causes me to almost%Ninstinctively drop the cup in my hand.%K%P

0x2D0
Okuhiko「Pardon me for interrupting.」%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「W-What the hell was that about?」%K%P

0x32C
Okuhiko「Well, it's just that I think everyone is starved right about%Nnow.」%K%P

0x348
Yuka「Ah! Now that you mention it, we've haven't eaten anything%Ntoday...」%K%P

0x35C
Okuhiko「Right? That's why, right now, everyone is gathering to%Neat.」%K%P

0x370
Yuka「I see. Thanks for telling us.」%K%P

0x37C
Okuhiko「Look, see that parasol over there by that stand?」%K%P

0x388
With the theatrics of an opera singer, Okuhiko points in%Nthat direction.%K%P

0x394
Okuhiko「I saved some seats for us over there.」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Gee, how awfully considerate of you...」%K%P

0x3B4
Okuhiko「Oh come on, it's no big deal.」%K%P

0x3C8
Okuhiko「Well then, I have to go find Haruka-chan, so if you'll%Nexcuse me...」%K%P

0x3D4
Okuhiko proceeds to flip his long hair...%K%P

0x3E0
Okuhiko「Ciao♪」%K%P

0x3F4
... While leaving us behind with those words.%K%P

0x400
"Ciao"...%K%P

0x40C
Yuka and I watch him go in awkward silence...%K%P

0x428
Yuka「... Well, shall we go?」%K%P

0x434
Yuka slaps my knees and stands up.%K%P

0x440
I peek into Yuka's cup to discover that it's empty.%K%P

0x44C
(Yuka... is she an alcoholic or something..?)%K%P

0x458
As I'm thinking, me and Yuka walk towards the parasol...%K%P

0x47C
Makoto「In a dream...」%K%P

0x498
Yuka「Oh!! Speaking of dreams...」%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x4B0
Yuka「I'm really sorry about yesterday.」%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「Huh? What do you mean?」%K%P

0x4C8
Yuka「Yesterday morning! You know, when I was sorta half%Nasleep.」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Oh, that?」%K%P

0x4E0
Makoto「Well, I figured that was the case...」%K%P

0x4F4
Yuka「It felt like the continuation of a dream.」%K%P

0x500
Yuka「It felt like I had awoken to another dream...」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x518
Makoto「And what kind of dream was it?」%K%P

0x524
Yuka「Umm... it's kind of hard to explain...」%K%P

0x530
Yuka「Anyway, it was a really unpleasant one.」%K%P

0x53C
Yuka「It was the worst kind possible... a hopeless dream.」%K%P

0x548
Makoto「A hopeless... dream? Could you be more specific?」%K%P

0x554
Yuka「Mmm... you say that, but...」%K%P

0x560
Yuka「I honestly don't really remember it too well...」%K%P

0x56C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x578
Yuka「Oh! But I do know...」%K%P

0x584
Yuka「That...」%K%P

0x608
Okuhiko「Shalom!!」%K%P

0x614
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0x648
Okuhiko's sudden appearance causes me to almost%Ninstinctively drop the cup in my hand.%K%P

0x654
Okuhiko「Pardon me for interrupting.」%K%P

0x6B4
Yuka「Huh? What is it, Okuhiko-kun?」%K%P

0x6C8
Okuhiko「Well, it's just that I think everyone is starved right about%Nnow.」%K%P

0x6D4
Yuka「Oh, I see... Now that you mention it, we haven't eaten%Nanything today...」%K%P

0x6E0
Okuhiko「Right? That's why, right now, everyone is gathering to%Neat.」%K%P

0x6F4
Yuka「Thanks for telling us.」%K%P

0x700
Okuhiko「Look, see that parasol over there by that stand?」%K%P

0x70C
With the agility of an opera singer, Okuhiko points in that%Ndirection.%K%P

0x718
Okuhiko「We have a table over there reserved for us.」%K%P

0x724
Yuka「That's awfully considerate of you...」%K%P

0x738
Okuhiko「Oh come on, it's no big deal.」%K%P

0x744
Okuhiko「Well then, I have to go find Haruka-chan, so if you'll%Nexcuse me...」%K%P

0x750
Okuhiko proceeds to flip his long hair...%K%P

0x764
Okuhiko「Ciao♪」%K%P

0x778
... And leaves us behind with those words.%K%P

0x794
Yuka「Well then, shall we go?」%K%P

0x7A0
Yuka slaps my knees and stands up.%K%P

0x7AC
Makoto「Huh!? ... But we're not done talk-」%K%P

0x7C0
Without listening to me, Yuka briskly walks over towards%Nthe parasol.%K%P

0x7CC
(A hopeless dream.) I'm a little worried for some reason.%K%P

0x7D8
"But I do know-" ―"But I do know"... What was Yuka%Ngoing to say after that?%K%P

0x7E4
My heart is filled with a heavy sense of dread.%K%P

0x888
After we had lunch, everyone bathed in the afternoon%Nsunlight while playing in the water like children.%K%N

0x894
Yuka, Izumi-san, Saki, and Okuhiko resembled kids as%Nthey merrily played in the water.%K%N

0x8A0
Even Haruka looked like she was having fun.%K%P

0x8B4
Before I knew it, my mind had become free from the%Nshadows of Yuka's remaining words.%K%N

0x8C0
The strongly shining sunlight has wiped out even the%Nsmallest traces of clouds in my mind...%K%P

0x8D4
After we had lunch, everyone bathed in the afternoon%Nsunlight while playing in the water like children.%K%N

0x8E0
Yuka, Izumi-san, Saki, and Okuhiko resembled kids as%Nthey merrily played in the water.%K%N

0x8EC
Even Haruka looked like she was having fun. Surprisingly,%Nthe sprays of water seemed to suit her very well...%K%P

0x980
The sun is going down, causing the temperature to%Ngradually decrease.%K%P

0x994
Saki「Shouldn't we be leaving now?」%K%P

0x9A0
As soon as Saki says this, we all simultaneously begin%Npreparing to go back.%K%P

0x9C4
However, there's still one other person roaming,%Nstaggering by the poolside. Said person staggers%Ntowards us and comes up to us...%K%P

0x9F4
Yuka「Huh? Ah we goin' back arready, guysh?」%K%P

0xA00
... then speaks.%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「Yeah, it's already getting cold.」%K%P

0xA18
I answer as calmly as possible.%K%P

0xA2C
Yuka「Culd? Yer culd?」%K%P

0xA38
Yuka「Buh eyem naht culd aht all.」%K%P

0xA44
She's speaking in a comedic drunk-like tone.%K%P

0xA50
Well, I guess I should have seen this coming...%K%P

0xA5C
After we finished lunch, Yuka spent her time at the stand,%Nbuying more draft beer.%K%P

0xA68
As far as I know, she downed at least 10 cups worth of%Nbeer.%K%P

0xA74
And if she had 10 cups over the course of about 2%Nhours, then that means she's had roughly one glass%Nevery 12 minutes.%K%P

0xA80
Anyone could mistake her at this point for a drunkard.%K%P

0xA8C
Makoto「... Well, we also have to check on Kurumi.」%K%P

0xAA0
Yuka「Oh, Kurumi... yuu meen Kurumi-tan? Yesh yesh yesh yesh...」%K%P

0xAAC
Makoto「If we don't hurry back, she'll be lonely.」%K%P

0xAC0
Yuka「H～～～mm............ Dash true.」%K%P

0xACC
Somehow, it seems I've managed to get her to agree with%Nme.%K%N

0xAD8
Just as I think that...%K%P

0xAEC
Yuka「Ah!!」%K%P

0xAF8
Makoto「Wh-What is it? Don't shout so suddenly.」%K%P

0xB0C
Yuka「Now dat yuu mention Kurumi-tan...」%K%P

0xB18
Yuka「Ishen't Kurumi-tan waitin' for ush at Lunabeach?」%K%P

0xB24
Makoto「That's what I just told you!」%K%P

0xB30
Yuka「Sho if we don't get back shoon, Kurumi-tan wil bee lonely?」%K%P

0xB3C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB48
She completely ignored me...%K%P

0xB5C
Yuka「Well♪ Eberiwan, lesh go back♪」%K%P

0xB70
Yuka calls out towards a group of boogie boards on top%Nof a bench.%K%P

0xB7C
Everyone has already left the shower rooms and are%Nnow headed to the changing rooms.%K%P

0xB88
Makoto「Haah... oh brother...」%K%P

0xB94
I firmly grab Yuka by the hand and escort her to the%Nshower room. Yuka walks behind me with tottering steps,%Nenthusiastically singing an English song.%K%P

0xBA0
At least, I think she was trying to sing in English; her%Nwords are so incomprehensible that it's kind of hard to%Ntell.%K%P

0xBAC
I shamefully watch as strangers coldly glare at us walk%Nby.%K%P
