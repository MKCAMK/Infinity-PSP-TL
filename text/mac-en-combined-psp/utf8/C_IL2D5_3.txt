Izumi「It's not 'Good morning'. What time do you think it is?」%K%P

0x78
Kurumi「Umm... a little past eleven?」%K%P

0x8C
Izumi「Do you realize how long you've been sleeping for?」%K%P

0xA0
Kurumi「But it's important to Kurumi's growth♪」%K%P

0xB4
Izumi「Wake up! It's 'growth', not 'gross'!」%K%P

0xC8
Kurumi「That's what Kurumi said.」%K%P

0xDC
Izumi「No, it wasn't.」%K%P

0xF0
Kurumi「Yes it was! It was growth.」%K%P

0x104
Izumi「What, really?」%K%P

0x118
Kurumi「Yeah...」%K%P

0x12C
Izumi「Huh〜... that's strange...」%K%P

0x140
Kurumi「Well, whatever, it doesn't matter♪」%K%P

0x14C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x158
Kurumi「More importantly, what were you doing just now,%NOnii-chan?」%K%P

0x164
Makoto「Nothing really. We were just talking...」%K%P

0x178
Kurumi「What? But you were just pulling each other's cheeks.」%K%P

0x184
Kurumi「Were you playing Bulldog Rock-Paper-Scissors?」%K%P

0x190
Makoto「Well, something like that.」%K%P

0x1A4
Kurumi「Then can Kurumi join in too?」%K%P

0x1B0
Makoto「What? But we've already finished...」%K%P

0x1C4
Kurumi「Huh? That's boring...」%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1E4
Kurumi「Ah! If that's the case...」%K%P

0x1F0
Kurumi「... Let's play cards♪」%K%P

0x214
—C-Cards!?%K%P

0x220
The instant I hear that, a shudder runs through me.%K%P

0x22C
I gulp, and look towards Izumi-san.%K%P

0x238
Izumi-san's face has also gone pale.%K%P

0x24C
Kurumi「We'll play cards... and the loser has to play a punishment%Ngame where they get their cheeks pulled♪」%K%P

0x258
Kurumi「Well? Shall we do it, shall we do it?」%K%P

0x264
Makoto「No... I'll pass... on cards.」%K%P

0x278
Kurumi「Why not? C'mon, c'mon, let's play Mental Guts♪」%K%P

0x2B0
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you weren't 'remembering' the numbers of%Nthe cards there.」%K%P

0x2BC
Izumi「Instead... you were just 'creating' the numbers on those%Ncards.」%K%P

0x2EC
I remember the words Izumi-san said on the night of the%N3rd.%K%P

0x2F8
(There's... no way that's possible...)%K%P

0x304
Although I think this, my courage is completely shot.%K%P

0x310
(If...)%K%P

0x31C
(If by chance, the same phenomenon occurs...)%K%P

0x328
(If I get all 26 pairs correct...)%K%P

0x334
I don't want to have thoughts like I did back then ever%Nagain.%K%P

0x340
"I definitely don't want to play cards". This firm thought%Nrepeats in my head over and over again.%K%P

0x354
Kurumi「Well then, wait a minute. Kurumi will go get the cards now.」%K%P

0x360
Makoto「H-Hey! Wait, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x374
Not hearing me, Kurumi heads for the counter.%K%P

0x380
I frantically chase after her.%K%P

0x3B8
Shift... shift... shift... shift...%K%P

0x3C4
Kurumi「Huh? That's strange...」%K%P

0x3D0
Kurumi「Kurumi thought the cards the customer forgot%Nyesterday were here...」%K%P

0x3E4
Kurumi「Hey, Onee-chan, do you know where the cards that were%Nhere went?」%K%P

0x400
Izumi-san silently shakes her head.%K%P

0x414
Kurumi「Hmm... maybe someone took them...」%K%P

0x420
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x42C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x440
Kurumi gets engrossed with searching the vicinity of the%Ncounter.%K%P

0x44C
While she's doing that, Izumi-san and I exchange glances.%K%P

0x458
Izumi-san's expression has gone stiff.%K%P

0x464
She seems to be trying to tell me something with her%Neyes.%K%P

0x470
But I'm unable to understand what that is.%K%P

0x484
Soon enough...%K%P

0x490
Kurumi「—Ah!」%K%P

0x49C
Kurumi shouts out.%K%P

0x4A8
I start speaking on reflex.%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「Sorry, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「I just remembered that there's something I need to take%Ncare of!」%K%P

0x4CC
I rush out of the shop without hearing Kurumi's reply.%K%P

0x544
It's good and all that I got out of the shop, but I have no%Nclue what to do next.%K%P

0x550
Without a destination, I begin walking west on the%Ncoastline road.%K%P

0x5A8
... ... ...%K%P

0x5FC
After walking for a little while, I can hear voices behind%Nthe curve.%K%P

0x608
Saki「W-Wait a minute!」%K%P

0x614
Saki「... Where are we going?!!」%K%P

0x620
Okuhiko「It's fine, you'll understand if you come with me!」%K%P

0x62C
I peek around the curve.%K%P

0x640
Saki and Okuhiko are standing with their backs turned%Ntowards me.%K%P

0x64C
In Okuhiko's left hand is a scrap of paper...%K%P

0x658
He's holding Saki's wrist with his right hand.%K%P

0x664
In the instant I try to call out to them with a "Hey"...%K%P

0x688
Saki「Kyaa!」%K%P

0x69C
... Okuhiko forcefully grabs Saki's wrist, and disappears%Ninto a thicket.%K%P

0x6A8
(Geez, what's Okuhiko scheming up this time...?)%K%P

0x6B4
I start running up to the spot where the two disappeared.%K%P

0x6C0
...%K%P

0x6CC
In the thick, overgrown woods, there's a thin path that is%Nbarely wide enough for a person to pass through.%K%P

0x6D8
I can't see Okuhiko or Saki anymore.%K%P

0x700
I can hear only the sound of movement in the grass from%Nfar away.%K%P

0x744
I step into the thicket, chasing after those two.%K%P

0x750
(... Ah... this road is...)%K%P

0x75C
I quickly remember it.%K%P

0x768
On the last loop's 4th, when Kurumi disappeared, Yuka%Nand I definitely went down this road.%K%P

0x774
Which means at the end of this road is that shrine.%K%P

0x780
(Why does Okuhiko plan on going to the shrine?)%K%P

0x78C
I quietly continue to walk while thinking this...%K%P

0x7C4
Due to the cloudy sky, my surroundings are very dim.%K%P

0x7D0
There's not even any birds chirping or any wind, making%Nthe air feel stagnant and heavy.%K%P

0x7DC
When I come to my senses, Okuhiko and Saki's%Npresences have disappeared.%K%P

0x7E8
I stand still and strain my ears, but I can't hear them%Nmoving through the grass.%K%P

0x7F4
It's completely silent...%K%P

0x800
A bad stench sticking to the trees wraps up the air.%K%P

0x80C
For some reason, my heart is restless.%K%P

0x818
It feels like it's telling me that I mustn't go any further.%K%P

0x824
An overpowering, intimidating air is coming from the thick%Ngrove of trees.%K%P

0x830
(Something's different from the last time I saw this...)%K%P

0x83C
The smell of the woods is clearly aggressive.%K%P

0x88C
I get out of the thicket, and finally arrive at the long%Nstone staircase.%K%P

0x898
I still don't see Okuhiko or Saki.%K%P

0x8A4
(Are they already in the shrine?)%K%P

0x8CC
I run up the crumbling staircase...%K%P

0x908
(...)%K%P

0x914
(...)%K%P

0x920
(...)%K%P

0x92C
(... You've got... to be kidding me...)%K%P

0x960
The scene before my eyes has left me dumbstruck.%K%P

0x96C
The open ground in the forest...%K%P

0x978
The straight, stone paving running through the center...%K%P

0x984
The long staircase behind me that I only just ran up...%K%P

0x990
But... the only thing that's gone...%K%P

0x99C
—Is the shrine!%K%N

0x9A8
—The Shiki no Mori Shrine has disappeared!%K%P

0x9DC
(... That's... impossible...)%K%P

0x9E8
I definitely saw that shrine.%K%P

0x9F4
I even went inside it when I found Kurumi.%K%P

0xA00
Even so...%K%N

0xA0C
What is the meaning of this...?%K%P

0xA18
Is there "no shrine" in this history...?%K%P

0xA3C
Izumi「Because... there's no longer a shrine at that cape.」%K%P

0xA50
Izumi-san said that on the 2nd while she was telling the%Nstory of the shrine at the cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0xA5C
(Is that... it...?)%K%P

0xA68
"A firm thought can produce a new reality."%K%P

0xA74
In other words, this is... a new reality produced by%NIzumi-san's delusion...?%K%P

0xA80
A delusion...%K%N

0xA8C
A fictional world...%K%N

0xA98
An event within a fantasy...%K%P

0xAA4
(The bell disappeared... the shrine's disappeared... and%Nthose cards disappeared...)%K%P

0xAB0
I'm unable to move.%K%P

0xABC
My mind has gone completely blank.%K%P

0xAC8
I lose power in my knees, and sit on the ground.%K%P

0xAD4
There's not one thing moving in my field of vision.%K%P

0xAE0
There are no shadows, no colors, no sound, and I don't%Neven have confidence that I actually exist here right%Nnow.%K%P

0xAEC
My consciousness feels as light as air right now, to the%Npoint that that it wouldn't be surprising at all if it were%Nblown out by a single gust of wind.%K%P

0xAF8
Dumbfounded, I just stare off blankly into space.%K%P

0xB04
I've lost all my senses...%K%P

0xB50
... ... ...%K%P

0xBA8
Before I know it, I'm back at Lunabeach.%K%P

0xBB4
My surroundings have been completely swallowed by%Ndarkness.%K%P

0xBC0
I don't even remember how I got here.%K%P

0xBCC
There's a few dishes spread out on the table.%K%P

0xBD8
As usual, Izumi-san is sitting across from me.%K%P

0xBE4
Izumi-san is alternating between saying something and%Neating.%K%P

0xBF8
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun? Are you listening?」%K%P

0xC04
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0xC10
I'm surprised.%K%P

0xC1C
The voice that came out of my mouth was surprised.%K%P

0xC28
My consciousness still isn't completely here...%K%P

0xC34
My eyes are fixed on my palm.%K%P

0xC40
For no reason, I just continue to stare at it.%K%P

0xC54
Izumi「Makoto-kun... what's wrong?」%K%P

0xC60
Makoto「No... nothing...」%K%P

0xC6C
Izumi「It doesn't look like nothing.」%K%P

0xC78
Izumi「You haven't even taken a single bite of the food...」%K%P

0xC84
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC90
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0xC9C
Makoto「... By the way... where's Kurumi?」%K%P

0xCB0
Izumi「Haah... I told you about that just now, didn't I?」%K%P

0xCBC
Makoto「... Is that right?」%K%P

0xCC8
Izumi「Kurumi went to visit the lodge.」%K%P

0xCD4
Izumi「She's staying over there today...」%K%P

0xCE0
Makoto「Oh, I see...」%K%P

0xCEC
Makoto「It's true, Kurumi did go to the lodge this day on the last%Nloop...」%K%P

0xCF8
Izumi「We just had this conversation.」%K%P

0xD04
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD18
Izumi「Hey, did something happen?」%K%P

0xD24
Makoto「No, nothing...」%K%P

0xD30
I reply immediately.%K%P

0xD3C
I just decided that there's absolutely no way I can tell%Nher about the shrine.%K%P

0xD48
Izumi「Really?」%K%P

0xD54
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xD60
Izumi「Liar... you're definitely hiding something.」%K%P

0xD6C
Makoto「No I'm not.」%K%P

0xD78
Makoto「I'm just a little tired...」%K%P

0xD84
I really am a liar.%K%P

0xD90
But looking at Izumi-san's gentle expression, there's no%Nway I can tell her the truth.%K%P

0xDAC
I haven't forgotten Izumi-san's reaction... when I told her%Nabout the bell this morning.%K%P

0xDB8
I don't want to give her more things to worry about.%K%P

0xDCC
Like this morning, I'm hiding it because I don't want to give%NIzumi-san more things to worry about.%K%P

0xDE0
Izumi「That's right...」%K%P

0xDEC
Izumi「To us, today is the eleventh day... of this Seminar Camp...」%K%P

0xDF8
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xE0C
Izumi「Do you want to lie down and rest for a bit?」%K%P

0xE18
Makoto「No, I'm fine...」%K%P

0xE24
Makoto「I said I'm tired, but it's no big deal.」%K%P

0xE30
Makoto「And besides... that'd be a waste...」%K%P

0xE44
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xE50
Makoto「If I didn't eat this food, it'd be a waste, wouldn't it?」%K%P

0xE5C
I desperately try my best to smile.%K%P

0xE70
Izumi「It's all right, you don't have to force yourself to eat.」%K%P

0xE7C
I don't answer her, and take a bite of the food.%K%P

0xE88
There's no flavor.%K%P

0xE94
Makoto「Ha ha, your cooking really is the greatest!」%K%P

0xEA0
Makoto「Just one bite of it has made me energetic again!」%K%P

0xEB4
Izumi「Really? That's good...」%K%P

0xEC0
I silently continue to eat the food.%K%P

0xECC
Although I'm attempting to act cheerful, my mind is%Ncompletely chaotic.%K%P

0xED8
—Is this fiction? —Is this reality?%K%N

0xEE4
—Is this a delusion? —Is this for real?%K%P

0xEF0
Just what meaning does this world have to me?%K%P

0xEFC
My confusion is like a whirlpool that is slowly sucking me%Nin.%K%P

0xF08
Izumi-san is kindly gazing at me.%K%P

0xF14
I can see the black sky over her shoulder.%K%P

0xF20
Right now, there's no stars in this night sky.%K%P

0xF2C
As if their radiance was suddenly lost...%K%P

0xF38
As if the stars were never there to begin with...%K%P

0xF44
The only thing that's there is a deep, endless darkness...%K%P
