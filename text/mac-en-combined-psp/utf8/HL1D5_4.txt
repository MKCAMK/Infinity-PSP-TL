Haruka「Makoto... you really have no talent for this.」%K%P

0x6C
Damn. She said it again...%K%P

0x78
Makoto「I know! You don't have to tell me for me to know that!」%K%P

0x8C
Haruka「It's fine. That's why I'm catching so much- it's to make up%Nfor you.」%K%P

0x98
Haruka teases me with a coy grin.%K%N

0xA4
However, I'm not annoyed. Not in the slightest...%K%P

0xB0
It's not because I'm acting tough or anything like that,%Nbut because Haruka is happy...%K That's all that's important%Nto me...%K%P

0xBC
The setting sun's glow illuminates Haruka's cheeks.%K%P

0x128
Haruka and I return to the lodge.%K%P

0x134
Haruka went to the bathroom, saying she was going to%Ntake a shower.%K%N

0x140
I'm currently lying down on the bed in my room.%K%P

0x14C
The five days of camp life up until today... a lot really has%Nhappened in them.%K%N

0x158
When I gently close my eyes, the memories up until today%Nare revived like a revolving lantern...%K%P

0x1D0
Haruka「Because I...」%K%P

0x1DC
Haruka「Because I... am nothing...」%K%P

0x1F0
Haruka「It's because...」%K%P

0x1FC
Haruka「It's because... I'm different.」%K%P

0x238
Haruka「I don't understand...」%K%P

0x244
Haruka「Because I... am nothing...」%K%P

0x250
Haruka「Because I have no heart...」%K%P

0x25C
Haruka「Because I have no heart... I don't understand.」%K%P

0x288
Haruka「Then why do people kiss?」%K%P

0x294
Makoto「Hmm... It's probably to demonstrate their love and confirm%Ntheir feelings for each other.」%K%P

0x2A0
Haruka「Confirm...?」%K%P

0x2AC
Haruka「Then... let's kiss.」%K%P

0x2C0
Haruka「Let's kiss.」%K%P

0x2EC
Saki「Stay away from me.」%K%P

0x300
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x314
Saki「What is it?! Get the hell away from me! I have no business%Nwith you, you damn clone...!」%K%P

0x328
Haruka「―!」%K%P

0x354
Haruka「Will you... will you always help me?」%K%P

0x360
Haruka「Will you protect me?」%K%P

0x384
Haruka「Forget I ever said anything. I need to stop right here!」%K%P

0x390
Haruka「Did I surprise you? Sorry for saying something so weird.」%K%P

0x39C
Haruka「I'll be fine. I have to at least deal with my own problems%Nsomehow by myself...」%K%P

0x3BC
Haruka「That's wrong...」%K%P

0x3C8
Haruka「That's wrong.」%K%P

0x3D4
Haruka「No one knows why they light up.」%K%P

0x3E0
Haruka「Nobody knows that.」%K%P

0x3EC
Haruka「It'll always remain a mystery...」%K%P

0x3F8
Haruka「Yes... That's why it's shiranui...」%K%P

0x424
Haruka「Makoto... as I thought, you really have no talent for this.」%K%P

0x438
Haruka「It's fine. That's why I'm catching so much- it's to make up%Nfor you.」%K%P

0x480
To me, who has been a slacker since entering college, all%Nof those memories are just precious personal%Nexperiences to me.%K%P

0x48C
Now that I think about it, what was the goal of this Camp%Nagain...?%K%P

0x498
"From the start, there was no goal. If there truly is one,%Nthen it's only to deepen the bonds of friendship%Nbetween the group members."%K ... Okuhiko certainly said%Nsomething like that, didn't he?%K%P

0x4A4
"Until the last day of the Camp, I can't tell anyone the%Npurpose behind it." ... Yuka also said something like that.%K%P

0x4B0
But none of that matters to me anymore.%K%P

0x4BC
Even though I think the original goal is trivial, I've begun%Nto feel that this Camp has something that's very%Nsignificant to me.%K%P

0x4C8
Haruka. This Camp is where Haruka and I met and got to%Nknow each other. That alone is enough.%K%P

0x4D4
... This Camp ends the day after tomorrow.%K%N

0x4E0
On the afternoon of the 7th, we'll have no choice but to%Nleave here.%K%N

0x4EC
And then, we'll return to our ordinary lives.%K%P

0x4F8
Ordinary lives... Just what is "ordinary"? An empty life%Nwhere nothing happens?%K%N

0x504
When I think that, I can't help but become melancholic.%K%P

0x510
Before I know it, I begun to wish that I could continue%Nliving this way forever.%K%P

0x51C
Here, there's Yuka, Saki, Kurumi, Izumi-san, Okuhiko too, I%Nsuppose, and of course...%K%N

0x528
... Haruka.%K%P

0x534
I feel a boundless attachment to these past five days,%Nthese days that have passed by dramatically to some%Nextent.%K%P

0x540
No matter how many times, I want these days to continue%Nalways...%K%N

0x54C
For eternity...%K%P

0x5EC
...%K%P

0x614
...%K%P

0x63C
(... Mmm... Mmm～...)%K%P

0x650
My eyes suddenly open.%K%N

0x65C
It seems I unawaringly fell asleep.%K%P

0x668
Makoto「Who is it?」%K%P

0x690
When I raise half of my body and call out to them, the%Ndoor opens.%K%P

0x6D8
Haruka is standing there.%K%N

0x6E4
She's staring straight at me.%K%P

0x700
Makoto「What's wrong?」%K%P

0x70C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x718
Makoto「Do you want something?」%K%P

0x724
Haruka「... Outside.」%K%P

0x730
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x73C
Haruka「Would you like... to go outside?」%K%P

0x748
Makoto「Outside...?」%K%P

0x754
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x760
Makoto「You mean... taking a walk?」%K%P

0x76C
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x778
Makoto「Why?」%K%P

0x784
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x790
Makoto「... Well, I don't mind.」%K%P

0x7A4
When I answer, Haruka's face lights up.%K%P

0x7B0
If I can be with Haruka, then I don't need a reason...%K%P

0x800
Haruka and I slowly descend the hill road.%K%P

0x80C
The nice weather of the last few days is long gone, to%Nthe point that the environment is very chilly.%K%P

0x818
Usually, the ground would feel moderately warm, but now%Nit feels as freezing as a winter's night.%K%N

0x824
If it was just a little bit colder, then there'd be frost%Ncollecting on the ground now.%K%P

0x830
We silently advance towards the coastline.%K%P

0x83C
(We'll only go as far as "Princess Beach" tonight.)%K%P

0x848
I think this, briefly thinking back to something that%Nhappened a few moments ago.%K%N

0x854
When we left the lodge, Haruka had muttered, "I want to%Ngo somewhere close where we can see the ocean."%K%P

0x868
Makoto「I don't think we'll be able to see the stars tonight...」%K%P

0x874
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x880
Makoto「And there'll be no shiranui either, since there's no%Ndifference in temperature between the shore and the%Nsea...」%K%P

0x88C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x898
Makoto「Ah, no... I don't know about that... No one knows why they%Nlight up, after all...」%K%P

0x8A4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x8B0
Makoto「But if it were around the same time as last night, then%Nmaybe they would...」%K%P

0x8BC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x8C8
I'm troubled.%K%N

0x8D4
What should I say!?%K%P

0x8E0
There's something I really want to say to her, right?%K%N

0x8EC
There's something I want to ask her, right?%K%N

0x8F8
I know what it is...%K%P

0x904
―Haruka, what do you think of me?%K%P

0x920
Makoto「... Haruka!」%K%P

0x934
Haruka「Huh?」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「Umm...」%K%P

0x94C
When I look at Haruka, my mind goes blank.%K%P

0x958
(My mind really has gone blank...)%K%P

0x964
Haruka「What's wrong?」%K%P

0x970
Makoto「A-Ah, no, umm...」%K%P

0x97C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x988
Makoto「Umm...」%K%P

0x994
Haruka「... I wonder if it's cold?」%K%P

0x9A0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x9AC
Haruka「The ocean tonight...」%K%P

0x9B8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9CC
Haruka「It'd be nice if it were cold.」%K%P

0x9D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x9EC
Haruka「... Makoto.」%K%P

0x9F8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xA04
Haruka「I wanted to be with you...」%K%P

0xA10
Haruka says this, and touches my hand.%K%N

0xA1C
The sensation of her palm is very smooth.%K%P

0xA28
Haruka「That's why...」%K%P

0xA34
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA40
Haruka「I wanted to go outside with you.」%K%P

0xA4C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA60
Haruka「I wanted... just the two of us to be together...」%K%P

0xA74
Haruka looks down at the ground.%K%N

0xA80
She stops walking.%K%P

0xAA8
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xAB4
My heart is brimming with emotions.%K%N

0xAC0
Haruka said it just now.%K%N

0xACC
"I wanted... just the two of us to be together..."%K%P

0xAD8
Haruka sees me as a man.%K%N

0xAE4
She never thought of me as a father-like figure.%K%N

0xAF0
My heart feels like it's burst open.%K%P

0xAFC
I gently squeeze Haruka's hand.%K%N

0xB08
Her warm body heat seeps from her hand into me.%K%P

0xB14
And so, Haruka and I once again begin walking towards%NPrincess Beach, holding hands the whole time...%K%P

0xB80
Even after our arrival at Princess Beach, the sky's as%Ngray as ever.%K%N

0xB8C
The dark clouds block out the stars and moonlight.%K%N

0xB98
Without the light, it's difficult to make out much.%K%P

0xBA4
I don't mind, though.%K%N

0xBB0
Because Haruka is beside me...%K%P

0xBC8
Haruka sits down on the beach.%K%N

0xBD4
She gets sand on her clothes, but doesn't seem to care%Nin the slightest.%K%N

0xBF8
I sit down next to her.%K%P

0xC04
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xC10
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC38
Haruka firmly stares at the ocean.%K%N

0xC44
Neither of us say anything.%K%N

0xC50
There's no need to.%K%N

0xC5C
In the darkness, all we can hear is the sound of the%Nwaves...%K%P

0xC74
As I stare at Haruka's face as she stares at the ocean%Nwith what appears to be obsession, I get the urge to%Nask her something that I've been curious about this%Nwhole time.%K%P

0xC80
Makoto「Say, Haruka?」%K%P

0xC8C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xCB0
Haruka silently turns her gaze towards me.%K%P

0xCBC
Makoto「Why is it that you love water so much?」%K%P

0xCC8
Yes... the ever-persistent "water".%K%P

0xCD4
Not just the ocean... Not just the pool... Not just the%Ndrops of water from the dripping faucet...%K%P

0xCE0
I feel that Haruka has always been attached to "water".%K%P

0xCEC
It's way beyond the level of "liking or disliking"%Nsomething...%K%P

0xCF8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xD20
Haruka continues to look at me, but doesn't try to%Nanswer.%K%N

0xD2C
While looking at those alluring eyes, I see uneasiness%Ncreeping up inside them.%K%P

0xD44
(Maybe I asked her something that I shouldn't have...?)%K%P

0xD50
Haruka continues to look at me with eyes that seem to%Nshine.%K%P

0xD5C
Makoto「Ah... no, if you don't want to answer... then that's fine...」%K%P

0xD68
Unable to bear it any longer, I say this.%K%P

0xD98
Haruka once again returns her gaze to the ocean.%K%P

0xDF0
... ... ...%K%P

0xE38
How much time has passed since then...?%K%N

0xE44
We continue to stare at the ocean, sitting down on the%Nbeach the whole time.%K%P

0xE58
Haruka「It's cold...」%K%P

0xE64
I hear Haruka mutter this.%K%P

0xE70
She's right...%K%N

0xE7C
Today's been a chilly day.%K%N

0xE88
Plus, it's nighttime, and the sea breeze is blowing directly%Non the shore.%K%N

0xE94
We'll have to leave if we want to escape it.%K%P

0xEA0
On the other hand, it doesn't seem like Haruka's in the%Nmood to return to the lodge.%K%P

0xEAC
I take off my jacket.%K%N

0xEB8
If I'm a man, then I have to do this.%K%N

0xEC4
I throw my jacket over Haruka's shoulders.%K%P

0xEE4
Haruka「Ah...」%K%P

0xEF0
Slightly surprised, she grips the tips of my jacket.%K%P

0xEFC
Haruka「You're going to get cold if you do this...」%K%P

0xF08
Haruka tries to take the jacket off. I gently grasp her%Nhand to stop her.%K%P

0xF2C
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0xF38
Makoto「It's fine.」%K%P

0xF44
I reassuringly shake my head.%K%P

0xF50
Makoto「Because I'm warm...」%K%P

0xF5C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xF68
Makoto「And besides...」%K%P

0xF74
I wrap my arm around Haruka's shoulders and pull her%Nbody towards mine.%K%P

0xF88
Makoto「As long as we're like this, I'll never get cold...」%K%P

0xF94
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xFA0
Makoto「Right?」%K%P

0xFAC
Haruka gives me a small, reserved nod.%K%P

0xFD4
The sound of waves breaking on the shore...%K%N

0xFE0
We huddle our bodies together while we listen to that%Npeaceful timbre.%K%N

0xFEC
Time starts to pass by calmly.%K%P

0xFF8
Before long...%K%N

0x1004
... We fall into a deep sleep inviting us from far away...%K%P
