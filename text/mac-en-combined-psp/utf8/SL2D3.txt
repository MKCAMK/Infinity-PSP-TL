The morning has arrived.%K%P

0x140
When I enter the living room, everything goes the same%Nway it did last time.%K%P

0x14C
When I begin to eat the toast Kurumi brought, Haruka%Ncomes in the same way she did last time.%K%P

0x158
Okuhiko is chasing after her...%K%P

0x16C
Okuhiko「Promise? What promise?」%K%P

0x190
Haruka「... I'm going fishing today.」%K%P

0x1A4
Haruka「... Today, I'm...」%K%P

0x1C0
Yuka「Hold on. We're scheduled to play tennis today.」%K%P

0x1D4
Haruka「Huh? ... Tennis?」%K%P

0x1E8
Yuka「Haruka, you can't just say 'I'll pass' today. That'd be%Ngoing against the group leader's orders.」%K%P

0x1FC
Haruka looks at me with a troubled expression.%K%P

0x218
Okuhiko「That's right, Haruka-chan. As planned, we're playing%Ntennis.」%K%P

0x22C
Haruka「I made a promise...」%K%P

0x238
Okuhiko「It's fine, just cancel that promise.」%K%P

0x244
Haruka「I have to keep my promise, no matter what!」%K%P

0x260
Kurumi「Haruka-san, who did you make that promise with?」%K%P

0x27C
Haruka「It was...」%K%P

0x288
Makoto「... With me.」%K%P

0x2B8
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x2C4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2E8
Makoto「Haruka and I are going fishing today. We're not going to%Nplay tennis.」%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「Haruka and I are going out today. We're not going to play%Ntennis.」%K%P

0x310
Okuhiko「Wh-Why is Ishihara saying that? Is this true,%NHaruka-chan?」%K%P

0x32C
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x338
Makoto「So we'll be going now. Sorry Yuka, but we're going to%Nhave to ignore your orders.」%K%P

0x354
Yuka「Well, that's fine... The leader's not a dictator, after all...」%K%P

0x370
Okuhiko「Just hold on, Yuka-chan. You can't just let them off this%Neasy. Ishihara, you still don't understand? The basis of%Nthis seminar is group activities, isn't it?」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「You have no right to say that.」%K%P

0x390
Okuhiko「What was that!?」%K%P

0x3A4
I leave the living room.%K%N

0x3B0
Haruka quickly follows me.%K%P

0x3C4
Okuhiko「Wait, Haruka-chan. What happened between you and%NIshihara?」%K%P

0x3D0
Haruka「... We made a promise.」%K%P

0x3DC
Okuhiko「That's not an explanation. What happened between you%Nand Ishihara yesterday?」%K%P

0x3E8
Haruka「I'm not going to tell you.」%K%P

0x3F4
Okuhiko「Why not?」%K%P

0x400
Haruka「This is something between me and Makoto... It doesn't%Nconcern you, Okuhiko.」%K%P

0x41C
Okuhiko「Why are you going fishing with Ishihara? What do you%Nsee in that asshole?」%K%P

0x430
Okuhiko「Why are you going with Ishihara? What do you see in that%Nasshole?」%K%P

0x43C
Haruka「Makoto... trusts me...」%K%P

0x448
Okuhiko「Trust? Ishihara? It's clear as day that this vulgar%Nbastard has some kind of ulterior motive.」%K%P

0x454
Haruka「We trust each other. You wouldn't understand...」%K%P

0x460
Okuhiko「You're the one who doesn't understand about Ishihara.」%K%P

0x46C
Haruka「What's going on between me and Makoto is none of your%Nconcern.」%K%P

0x480
Okuhiko「You're wrong! It does concern me! Haruka-chan, I-!」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「Okuhiko, stop making a fool of yourself.」%K%P

0x4A0
Okuhiko「Shut up. You don't have the right to say anything.」%K%P

0x4AC
Makoto「Whatever... Haruka, shall we go?」%K%P

0x4C8
Haruka「Wait. Tell him straight.」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x4E0
Haruka「About how you and I... trust each other, no matter what%Nhappens... isn't that right?」%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x4F8
Haruka「Tell Okuhiko. Tell him it doesn't concern him. Tell him we're%Nthe only ones who understand.」%K%P

0x504
Hold on...%K%N

0x510
Where did this turn of events... come from...?%K%P

0x51C
Haruka「Why aren't you saying anything?」%K%P

0x528
Makoto「No, I...」%K%P

0x534
Haruka「Are you saying we can't trust each other?」%K%P

0x540
Makoto「That's not it, that's not it at all.」%K%P

0x54C
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan, what's so good about this irresponsible%Nbastard?」%K%P

0x558
Makoto「Irresponsible!?」%K%P

0x564
You don't even know the circumstances!%K%P

0x570
Makoto「I trust Haruka!」%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「We made a promise last night. I trust Haruka. That's why%NHaruka trusts me, too!」%K%P

0x5D0
—Suddenly, a dry sound echoes.%K%P

0x5DC
Taken aback, we all turn towards the sound. Saki is%Nstanding frozen at the front door...%K%P

0x5E8
Laying at her feet is her basket.%K%P

0x604
Saki「I see... so you really trust her after all...」%K%P

0x610
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0x61C
Shit! Now that I think about it... this is around the time Saki%Narrived last time!%K%P

0x628
Makoto「Hold on, Saki!」%K%P

0x634
Saki「I-I'll be going now... Farewell.」%K%P

0x648
Makoto「Y-You're wrong. There's a reason for-!」%K%P

0x654
I rush over to Saki as she tries to run.%K%P

0x660
I reach my hand out, but Saki violently slaps it aside.%K%P

0x66C
She gives me a piercing glare.%K%P

0x694
Just then, she suddenly crushes the basket.%K%P

0x708
She's crushing it!%K%N

0x714
——The sound of wood snapping is heard.%K%N

0x720
——The basket has now broken apart.%K%P

0x72C
Plastic tableware scatters everywhere. Sandwiches%Ncome flying out.%K%P

0x744
Even though I made preparations to prevent it this time...%K%P

0x750
Haruka throws a powerful glance at Saki, then gets%Ncloser and closer to her.%K%P

0x75C
Haruka「Saki! You're wrong!」%K%P

0x780
Saki「Stay away from me!」%K%P

0x78C
Even so, Haruka doesn't stop walking.%K%P

0x7A0
Saki「What is it? Get the hell away from me! I have no business%Nwith you, you damn clone!」%K%P

0x7AC
Haruka「!!!」%K%P

0x7C8
Okuhiko「Ah...」%K%P

0x7DC
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x7F8
Kurumi「... Clone?」%K%P

0x804
...%K%P

0x810
In the end, the same thing happened.%K%P

0x81C
It happened quite a bit earlier than last time, but...%K%P

0x828
I don't really remember what happened after that.%K%P

0x834
I'm unable to think of anything.%K%P

0x840
The shock from this time is nowhere as big as it was last%Ntime, but...%K%P

0x84C
At any rate, this time, I ended up only hurting both Saki%Nand Haruka...%K%P

0x8B8
When I come to my senses, it's already nighttime.%K%P

0x8C4
After what happened, I've been hiding out in my room.%K%P

0x8D0
I still haven't found a way to change Saki's situation.%K%P

0x8DC
As time passes on, I start to get impatient.%K%P

0x8E8
Despite history somewhat changing, it seems like it's still%Nheaded in a similar direction.%K%P

0x8F4
Lying down on the floor of my room is Saki's broken%Nbasket...%K%P

0x900
(I should... try to fix it.)%K%P

0x90C
This time, I'll fix it myself.%K%P

0x918
The current me is the only one who can do something%Nthat trivial...%K%P

0x960
... ... ...%K%P

0x9DC
As I'm fixing the basket, Haruka suddenly comes in.%K%P

0x9E8
Haruka「Is that Saki's?」%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xA00
Haruka「Have you been fixing it all this time?」%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「... Well, yeah.」%K%P

0xA18
Haruka「I'll help.」%K%P

0xA24
Makoto「It's fine...」%K%P

0xA30
Haruka「It's my fault... right?」%K%P

0xA3C
Makoto「That's not true.」%K%P

0xA48
Haruka「You don't have to cover for me.」%K%P

0xA54
Makoto「No, it really isn't your fault.」%K%P

0xA68
Haruka「I'll help.」%K%P

0xA74
Makoto「I said it's fine.」%K%P

0xA80
Haruka「What you're feeling isn't irresponsible, right?」%K%P

0xA8C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA98
Haruka「Even I understand at least that much...」%K%P

0xAA4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAB0
Haruka「That's why...」%K%P

0xABC
Makoto「Haruka... just what happened between you and Saki?」%K%P

0xAC8
Makoto「You... need to talk properly to her.」%K%P

0xAD4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xAE0
Makoto「I hate it when I see the two of you like you are right now...」%K%P

0xAEC
Makoto「Your relationship is strained over a simple%Nmisunderstanding.」%K%P

0xAF8
Makoto「Don't you find that strange?」%K%P

0xB04
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「You might be scared, but I want you to leave it to me...」%K%P

0xB1C
Haruka「... All right.」%K%P

0xB28
As I nod, I hold up the basket I'm fixing.%K%P

0xB34
Makoto「I think it'll take until tomorrow morning to fix... It's a really%Nbig job, you know?」%K%P

0xB48
Haruka「I understand...」%K%P

0xB5C
Haruka gives me a little smile...%K%P
