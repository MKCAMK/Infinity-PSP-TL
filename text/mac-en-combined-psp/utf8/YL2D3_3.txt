Kurumi「Well then, let's go～♪」%K%P

0x108
Kurumi takes the lead as she enters the forest...%K%P

0x174
Now that I think about it, this is when Yuka invited me to%Nteam up with her...%K%P

0x188
Now that I think about it, this is when Haruka invited me to%Nteam up with her...%K%P

Now that I think about it, this is when Izumi-san invited me%Nto team up with her...%K%P

0x1BC
??「Hey, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x1C8
Just as expected.%K%P

0x1D4
I turn around towards the voice.%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x1EC
I let out a surprised voice.%K%P

0x258
For some reason, the one there isn't Yuka...%K%P

0x26C
For some reason, the one there isn't Haruka...%K%P

0x280
For some reason, the one there isn't Kurumi...%K%P

0x294
For some reason, the one there isn't Izumi-san...%K%P

0x2A8
Saki「Shh...! Don't shout!」%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「S-Saki... Why?」%K%P

0x2C0
Saki「Right... umm...?」%K%P

0x2CC
Saki「So we're really going to do this Test of Courage, right?」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x2E4
Saki「And in a Test of Courage, people usually get put into%Npairs, right?」%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「Well... yeah.」%K%P

0x2FC
Saki「Right. And I think that when we get there, it's likely that%Nwe'll be divided into pairs via Rock-Paper-Scissors...」%K%P

0x308
Saki「Therefore... I wanted to discuss something with you...」%K%P

0x314
Makoto「Could it be that during Rock-Paper-Scissors... you want%Nme to release the same hand as you?」%K%P

0x328
Saki「Huh? How did you...?」%K%P

0x334
Makoto「N-No, in a past Test of Courage, someone asked me to%Ndo that as a way of pairing up with me.」%K%P

0x348
Saki「Well, that makes things quicker.」%K%P

0x354
Saki「In other words, that's how it is.」%K%P

0x360
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x36C
I am too bewildered to reply.%K%P

0x378
I'm stunned that Saki is the one inviting me along this time.%K%P

0x384
Why did history change?%K%P

0x390
I don't think I've done anything particularly different in%Nthese past few hours...%K%P

0x39C
―Ah!%K%P

0x3A8
I see... That's it...%K%P

0x3B4
Now that I think about it, Saki wasn't here during the last%NTest of Courage...%K%P

0x3C0
Because of that, history has subtly changed...%K%P

0x3CC
Saki「Well... if you don't want to, that's fine...」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3E4
Saki「Anyway, I'll be going with scissors.」%K%P

0x3F0
Saki「Makoto-kun... Will you think about it?」%K%P

0x404
Leaving with those words, Saki goes chasing after the%Nothers.%K%P

0x410
Makoto「Think about it, huh...?」%K%P

0x490
Right now, I'm walking in the graveyard.%K%P

0x49C
Saki is strolling by my side.%K%P

0x4A8
In the end, I took her up on her proposal.%K%P

0x4B4
I thought it would be rude to refuse a girl's invitation, and%Nbesides...%K%P

0x4C0
... Saki is leaving a clearly different impression on me%Nthan the last loop... I think I like this Saki more.%K%P

0x4CC
However, I still don't know why Saki wanted to team up%Nwith me.%K%P

0x4D8
I give Saki a sidelong glance.%K%P

0x4E4
She looks at the group of tombstones calmly, with no%Nfear whatsoever.%K%P

0x4F0
Judging from her behavior, it doesn't seem like she%Nwanted to pair up because she was scared and didn't%Nwant to be alone.%K%P

0x4FC
(Then why?)%K%P

0x508
I decide to ask her.%K%P

0x514
Makoto「Say, Saki?」%K%P

0x528
Saki「Hmm?」%K%P

0x534
Makoto「I have a question that's been bugging me... Why did you%Ninvite me?」%K%P

0x540
Saki「You want me to tell you?」%K%P

0x54C
Makoto「Well... yeah...」%K%P

0x560
Saki「All right. Then I'll tell you.」%K%P

0x56C
Saki「I wanted to know more.」%K%P

0x578
Makoto「Huh...? About what?」%K%P

0x584
Saki「About you, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x590
Saki「I want to know more about you, Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x59C
I automatically become flustered.%K%P

0x5A8
Who could blame me?%K%P

0x5B4
Anyone would get flustered if a girl said something like%Nthat to them.%K%P

0x5C8
Saki「I guess I was a little curious.」%K%P

0x5D4
Makoto「C-Curious... you're curious about me?」%K%P

0x5E0
Saki「Yeah.」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「Wh-Why?」%K%P

0x5F8
Saki「Because you're similar.」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「... To whom?」%K%P

0x610
Saki「A classmate of mine from middle school.」%K%P

0x61C
Saki「He was a boy that Yuka loved.」%K%P

0x628
H-Hey... not the same conceited bastard again...%K%P

0x634
But... if even a third party like Saki is saying that, then%Nare we actually that similar?%K%P

0x640
Makoto「Hey, Saki? Just what are the similarities between that%Nguy and me?」%K%P

0x654
Saki「Oh! You know who I'm talking about?」%K%P

0x660
Makoto「Yeah. I heard about him earlier from Yuka.」%K%P

0x674
Saki「Well, no wonder... There's no way she wouldn't mention him,%Ngiven the circumstances...」%K%P

0x680
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x68C
Saki「But it's not like you're complete splitting images or%Nanything.」%K%P

0x698
Makoto「Then what is it? ... Is it our faces?」%K%P

0x6A4
Saki「No. You two look completely different...」%K%P

0x6B0
Makoto「Then what?」%K%P

0x6BC
Saki「Hmm... How should I put this?」%K%P

0x6C8
Saki「Your personality... perhaps?」%K%P

0x6D4
Makoto「Personality?」%K%P

0x6E0
Saki「But that's also a little different...」%K%P

0x6EC
Makoto「What the hell? How could you call us similar if we don't%Neven look or act alike?!」%K%P

0x700
Saki「You two are similar! You definitely are!」%K%P

0x714
Saki「I think it's probably your overall attitude that is the%Nsame... Like your bearing or something...」%K%P

0x720
... My bearing???%K%P

0x72C
Saki「There's a certain essential part of you that you%Ndefinitely share with that boy...」%K%P

0x738
Saki「So even though your faces and personalities are%Ndifferent, it feels like you're the same person...」%K%P

0x744
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x750
Saki「Occasionally, at times when I see you act impulsively, it%Nreally feels like I'm hallucinating.」%K%P

0x75C
Saki「It feels like you're just like that boy if...」%K%P

0x768
If... if... what?%K%P

0x77C
―Then, at that time.%K%P

0x788
??「KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0x794
Saki and I turn around upon hearing this bloodcurdling%Nscream from behind us.%K%P

0x7A0
??「WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!」%K%P

0x7AC
As the crying gets louder, we see a black shadow%Nrunning towards us with great speed...%K%P

0x7B8
... It's Yuka.%K%P

0x7CC
Saki「Wh-What's wrong, Yuka!?」%K%P

0x7E8
Yuka「H-H-H-H-H-H-H...」%K%P

0x7FC
Saki「It's all right! Anyway, calm down!」%K%P

0x808
Saki firmly grasps Yuka's shoulders, and calms her down.%K%P

0x814
Yuka「H-He-Head-Head...」%K%P

0x820
Saki「Head??」%K%P

0x83C
Haah... Oh brother... Did Kurumi get her again?%K%P

0x848
Just then...%K%P

0x864
Izumi「Haah, haah... Geez, don't go running off without a word,%NYuka-chan!」%K%P

0x870
... Izumi, who was paired with Yuka, comes up to us, quite%Nout of breath.%K%P

0x87C
Izumi「That was a dog! ... It was just a puppy sticking its head%Nout of the bushes!」%K%P

0x888
I see, a puppy...%K%P

0x894
... Wait a minute, shouldn't Yuka have been prepared for it%Nthis time...!?%K%P

0x8A8
Makoto「Head??」%K%P

0x8B4
And, over there...%K%P

0x8D0
Izumi「Haah, haah... Geez, don't go running off without a word,%NYuka-chan!」%K%P

0x8DC
... Izumi, who was paired with Yuka, comes up to us, quite%Nout of breath.%K%P

0x8E8
Izumi「That was a dog! ... It was just a puppy sticking its head%Nout of the bushes!」%K%P

0x8F4
A puppy...? To think there'd be a puppy in this%Ngraveyard...%K%P

0x900
... Wait a minute, that's what scared Yuka...!?%K%P

0x91C
Saki「Hee hee.」%K%P

0x928
Saki laughs.%K%P

0x93C
...%K%P

0x948
As we return to the lodge, Yuka keeps muttering%Ndeliriously to herself like a person who was abducted by%Naliens...%K%P

0x9E8
After that, I tumble down on top of my bed the moment I%Nreturn to my room.%K%P

0x9F4
Kurumi is in the living room, watching "Oedo Gatten".%K%P

0xA00
Everyone else went to the hot springs.%K%P

0xA0C
Of course, I was also invited, but this being the 9th day%Nof the Camp, my body was so exhausted that I didn't%Nhave the energy to go to the hot springs.%K%P

0xA18
I lie on the bed, and gently close my eyes.%K%P

0xA24
Before long, my consciousness slowly fades into a%Ndeep sleep...%K%P

0xAAC
In the middle of the night... I suddenly wake up.%K%P

0xAB8
For some reason, it was a pleasant awakening.%K%P

0xAC4
It might be because I was sleeping extremely deeply.%K%P

0xAD0
Anyway, I feel completely awake, no feelings of%Ndrowsiness left within me.%K%P

0xADC
(I doubt I'll be able to sleep like this...)%K%P

0xAE8
(Since I'm awake, I'll...)%K

0x11C8
Try going to the hot springs.

0x11D4
Just stay here.

0xB28
I'll try going to the hot springs...%K%P

0xB34
Making up my mind, I jump out of my bed.%K%P

0xB74
I'll just stay here...%K%P

0xB80
I think that, and close my eyelids again, but...%K%P

0xB8C
... ... ... ...%K%P

0xBB4
Dammit, I really can't sleep.%K

0x11E0
If I go to the hot springs...

0x11EC
Hot springs are just a pain in the ass.

0xBF4
If I go to the hot springs, I'll probably get sleepy...%K%P

0xC00
Making up my mind, I jump out of my bed.%K%P

0xC50
Hot springs are just a pain in the ass.%K%P

0xC5C
Nonetheless, it doesn't change the fact that I can't%Nsleep.%K%P

0xC68
Then what should I do?%K%P

0xC74
If I knew this was going to happen, then I should have%Nbrought a book...%K

0x11F8
I have to go to the hot springs.

0x1204
Try thinking deeply.

0xCB4
Can't be helped... If I go to the hot springs, I'll probably%Nget sleepy...%K%P

0xCC0
Making up my mind, I jump out of my bed.%K%P

0xD30
As I absently stare at the ceiling, I think about today.%K%P

0xD3C
―Wednesday, April 3rd.%K%P

0xD48
The April 3rd in the last loop had Saki getting pissed off%Nand storming away.%K%P

0xD54
And she revealed the fact that Haruka was a clone...%K%P

0xD60
If that's so, then that means that this time, the others%Nwon't know about that...%K%P

0xD6C
Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing.%K%P

0xD78
It doesn't really need to be hidden, but there's no%Nreason to tell them, either.%K%P

0xD84
Since Saki didn't almost drown... this peaceful day was%Nable to happen.%K%P

0xD90
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0xD9C
I sigh.%K%P

0xDA8
Perhaps because I've let my mind relax, my drowsiness%Nslowly returns.%K%P

0xDB4
It feels like I'm being rocked in a cradle...%K%P

0xDC0
I close my eyes, and instantly fall into a peaceful sleep...%K%P

0xE9C
As I soak in the hot water, I look back on today.%K%P

0xEA8
―Wednesday, April 3rd.%K%P

0xEB4
The April 3rd in the last loop had Saki getting pissed off%Nand storming away.%K%P

0xEC0
And she revealed the fact that Haruka was a clone...%K%P

0xECC
If that's so, then that means that this time, the others%Nwon't know about that...%K%P

0xED8
Well, this doesn't necessarily sound like a bad thing.%K%P

0xEE4
It doesn't really need to be hidden, but there's no%Nreason to tell them, either.%K%P

0xEF0
Since Saki didn't almost drown... this peaceful day was%Nable to happen.%K%P

0xEFC
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0xF08
I sigh.%K%P

0xF14
I notice that the heat has even permeated into the core%Nof my body, to the point where I can feel a profuse%Namount of blood pounding around my temples.%K%P

0xF20
(It seems it'd be best if I got going now.)%K%P

0xF2C
I slowly stand up, quickly change into my clothes, and%Nleave the hot springs...%K%P

0xF94
It seems my blood has completely rushed up to my head.%K%P

0xFA0
I return to my room, and immediately throw my body onto%Nthe bed.%K%P

0xFAC
The dizziness I feel from all the blood in my head makes%Nme feel like I'm being rocked in a cradle.%K%P

0xFB8
I close my eyes, and suddenly fall into a peaceful sleep...%K%P
