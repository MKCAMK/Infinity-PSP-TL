??「Hee hee...」%K%P

0x58
I turn to find Izumi-san, giggling as she watches me by%Nthe edge of the pool.%K%P

0x64
Izumi「You're a good swimmer.」%K%P

0x70
Makoto「You think so?」%K%P

0x7C
Izumi「Yes, and you do a good job at holding your breath. It's%Nnot that easy to do.」%K%P

0x88
Makoto「... I don't think that's true.」%K%P

0x94
Though my words are humble, I feel far from modest. Who%Nwouldn't feel proud after being praised like that?%K%P

0xA0
Especially when it's given by a beautiful woman like%NIzumi-san.%K%P

0xB4
Izumi「... But.」%K%P

0xC0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xD4
Izumi「Even so, I think I'm a better swimmer than you are,%NMakoto-kun.」%K%P

0xE0
Makoto「Wanna test that theory?」%K%P

0xEC
I challenge Izumi-san.%K%P

0xF8
She nods in agreement.%K%P

0x104
Izumi「Do you want to bet?」%K%P

0x110
Makoto「Sure thing.」%K%P

0x11C
It's not that I'm confident in my own swimming.%K%P

0x128
It's just that the way this conversation is going, it feels%Nlike the right thing to do...%K%P

0x13C
Izumi「So what if I win?」%K%P

0x148
Makoto「I... will give you a day's worth of shoulder massages.」%K%P

0x15C
Izumi「That's stingy... Why don't you make it one week?」%K%P

0x168
Makoto「Huh? Do you really need it for that long?」%K%P

0x17C
Izumi「Yes. Lately, my shoulders have been so stiff... I wonder if%Nage is catching up with me...?」%K%P

0x188
Makoto「No... that's not...」%K%P

0x194
Of course... Izumi-san has been managing that%Nrestaurant alone.%K%P

0x1A0
That's why her shoulders are stiff. All right... in that case...%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「Izumi-san, if I lose, then I'll help out at Lunabeach for one%Nday... Sound good?」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi「Huh, really?」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「A man never goes back on his word!」%K%P

0x1E0
Izumi「Hmm... then if you win, I'll...」%K

0x15F8
"Let me rest my head on your lap!"

0x1604
Leave it to Izumi-san.

0x230
Makoto「Let me rest my head on your lap!」%K%P

0x23C
I immediately declare this.%K%P

0x250
Izumi「What!?」%K%P

0x25C
Makoto「... Agh!!」%K%P

0x268
What the hell am I saying? Wouldn't that be considered%Nsexual harassment?%K%P

0x27C
However, Izumi-san smiles sweetly at me, and answers.%K%P

0x288
Izumi「All right. However, if I win...」%K%P

0x294
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x2A0
She's totally okay with it?%K%P

0x2AC
Is she really this confident...? Or is it...?%K%P

0x2C0
Izumi「Well then, I'll let you rest your head in my lap while I pick%Nyour ears♪」%K%P

0x2CC
Makoto「Huh? Really!?」%K%P

0x2D8
It's like she doesn't even care about the meaning of%Nthose words. Laying my head in her lap as she picks my%Nears.%K%P

0x2E4
Hell yeah! I've gotta win!!%K%P

0x2F0
I get fired up.%K%P

0x304
Izumi「I'll let you have a year's supply of free food from%NLunabeach.」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「WHAT!? Really?」%K%P

0x324
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0x330
Makoto「All right～! I've gotta win!!」%K%P

0x33C
I get fired up.%K%P

0x350
...%K%P

0x35C
We stand on the diving boards used for swimming races%Nat the pool.%K%P

0x370
Izumi「Well then, let's go.」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「Ready... Set...」%K%P

0x388
??「GOOOO!」%K%P

0x394
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x3D4
Someone pushes me from behind, and I fall head first into%Nthe pool.%K%P

0x3FC
Izumi-san starts swimming in that interval...%K%P

0x438
Yuka「Kyahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0x444
... The culprit was Yuka.%K%P

0x450
She is holding her sides with laughter. In her hand, she is%Nholding a glass of... beer!%K%P

0x45C
Makoto「A-Are you... drunk...?」%K%P

0x478
Yuka「Huh? Shouldn't you hurry up and swim?」%K%P

0x484
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x490
In the time I've been floating here, Izumi-san has almost%Nreached the other end of the pool.%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「AAHH!!」%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「...Y-YOU JUST COST ME MY HEAD REST AND MY EAR PICKING!!」%K%P

0x4CC
Yuka「Huh～?」%K%P

0x4E0
I frantically start swimming.%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「... Y-YOU JUST COST ME MY YEAR'S SUPPLY OF FOOD!!」%K%P

0x508
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x51C
I frantically start swimming.%K%P

0x554
I desperately swim after Izumi-san.%K%P

0x560
I desperately crawl, paddle, and breaststroke.%K%P

0x56C
I desperately try every fast swimming technique in the%Nbook...%K%P

0x578
... But even so, Izumi-san is faster.%K%P

0x584
By the time I'm halfway there, Izumi-san has already%Nreached the goal.%K%P

0x590
... I reach the finishing point soon after.%K%P

0x5A4
Izumi「... Well? Are you impressed?」%K

0x1610
"Yeah, I am..."

0x161C
"Th-That didn't count!"

0x5EC
Makoto「Yeah, I am...」%K%P

0x5F8
I honestly admit defeat.%K%P

0x604
Even if Yuka hadn't interfered, I probably still would have%Nlost.%K%P

0x610
Izumi-san is simply unbelievably fast.%K%P

0x624
Izumi「You're an honest one, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x638
Makoto「Th-That didn't count!」%K%P

0x64C
Izumi「Huh～, why not～?」%K%P

0x658
Makoto「Because...」%K%P

0x664
Izumi「Men don't go back on their word!」%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Ugh...!!」%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「... B-Because Yuka came and got in my way.」%K%P

0x690
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x69C
Izumi「So you're saying that you would've won if she hadn't%Ngotten in your way?」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「Of course!」%K%P

0x6BC
Izumi「... Very well. Then let's have a rematch.」%K%P

0x6C8
... Bring it on.%K%P

0x6DC
... ... ...%K%P

0x6E8
... It was foolish for me to accept her challenge.%K%P

0x6F4
I lost. She completely trashed me.%K%P

0x700
Even if Yuka hadn't interfered earlier, I probably still%Nwould have lost.%K%P

0x70C
Izumi-san is simply too fast.%K%P

0x718
Izumi「... Are you satisfied now?」%K%P

0x724
I can't do anything but nod.%K%P

0x738
Izumi「Hee hee hee... then you have to work at Lunabeach as%Npromised, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x744
Makoto「... Okay.」%K%P

0x750
Izumi「Whenever's fine♪ Whichever is the most convenient day%Nfor you.」%K%P

0x75C
Makoto「... Okay.」%K%P

0x770
We get out of the pool and sit down on the edge of the%Npool.%K%P

0x78C
I dip my feet into the water. Just like Haruka last night...%K%P

0x7BC
Izumi「Hee hee hee...」%K%P

0x7C8
Makoto「? ... What's up?」%K%P

0x7D4
Izumi「Now that I think about it, it's been a long time since I've%Nhad time in private to enjoy myself.」%K%P

0x7E0
Izumi「I've almost no time to spend with people as young as%Nyour group.」%K%P

0x7EC
Makoto「... Are you saying you're a workaholic or something?」%K%P

0x7F8
Izumi「Hmm... Well, I wouldn't say that it's like that.」%K%P

0x804
Izumi「Well, full fledged adults have lots of troubles.」%K%P

0x810
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x81C
Full fledged adults, huh... In two years, I guess I'll be right%Nup there with them.%K%N

0x828
... Ah, but I've got to go job hunting before that...%K%P

0x834
It doesn't feel real.%K%P

0x840
What will I do when I go out into society?%K%P

0x84C
Izumi「What's wrong? You suddenly fell silent.」%K%P

0x858
Makoto「No... it's just that I'll be a full fledged adult as well in just%Ntwo years.」%K%P

0x864
Makoto「It doesn't feel real. On the contrary, I don't even know%Nwhat I'll be doing then...」%K%P

0x870
Izumi「Hmm... well, won't you know at that time?」%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「Perhaps...」%K%P

0x888
Izumi「It's fine. You'll be a fine adult, Makoto-kun♪」%K%P

0x894
Makoto「... You think so?」%K%P

0x8A0
Izumi「I do.」%K%P

0x8AC
Makoto「Why's that?」%K%P

0x8B8
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x8C4
Makoto「How can you assert that 'I'll become a splendid adult'?」%K%P

0x8D0
Izumi「Ah ha, judging from that response, you don't have a lot%Nof self-confidence, do you?」%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「Confidence, huh...」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「You're right, I don't have any.」%K%P

0x8F4
Makoto「In the first place, I don't know if I'll even be able to%Ngraduate or not.」%K%P

0x900
Izumi「You don't attend your classes much?」%K%P

0x90C
Makoto「'Much' is an overstatement. Try 'not at all'.」%K%P

0x918
Izumi-san just sympathetically smiles as I deride myself.%K%P

0x924
Makoto「I've obtained virtually no credits, and I should have to%Nrepeat a year.」%K%P

0x930
Makoto「But I practically prostrated myself and begged before%Nmy course of study official...」%K%P

0x93C
Izumi「And so, somehow, you were able to temporarily advance%Nto your junior year?」%K%P

0x948
Makoto「Pretty much.」%K%P

0x954
Izumi-san still smiles at me.%K%P

0x960
It's like the smile of an elementary school teacher who's%Nlistening to one her students with bad grades tell her%Ntheir worries... It's a very kind one.%K%P

0x96C
Izumi「But that's certainly difficult...」%K%P

0x978
Izumi「The Psychology major has the strictest advancement%Ncriteria in the Literature Department, right?」%K%P

0x984
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x990
Makoto「Yeah... it sure seems that way...」%K%P

0x99C
Makoto「But Izumi-san... how did you know I was going for a%NPsychology major?」%K%P

0x9A8
Izumi「... Huh?!」%K%P

0x9BC
Izumi「A-Ah... that's...」%K%P

0x9C8
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x9D4
Izumi「... because I heard about it.」%K%P

0x9E8
Izumi「That's right, I heard it from Yuka-chan!」%K%P

0x9F4
Izumi-san's expression momentarily stiffens.%K%P

0xA08
She lowers her head and kicks her legs, splashing the%Nwater.%K%P

0xA1C
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0xA28
She stops kicking, and looks at me.%K%P

0xA34
But immediately afterwards...%K%P

0xA48
Izumi「No... it's nothing.」%K%P

0xA54
... she says this, and averts her gaze.%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「???」%K%P

0xA6C
Izumi-san falls completely silent.%K%P

0xA78
It's like she's deep in thought about something...%K%P

0xA84
... Should I change the topic?%K

0x1628
"Kurumi's quite a strange girl."

0x1634
"What are your hobbies?"

0x1640
"Who do you respect most?"

0x164C
"Do you have a boyfriend?"

0xAEC
Makoto「Kurumi's quite a strange girl.」%K%P

0xB00
Izumi「Huh? How so?」%K%P

0xB0C
Makoto「Hmm, how do I put it... err...」%K%P

0xB18
Makoto「Normally, she's very childish, but from time to time... she%Nlooks very mature...」%K%P

0xB24
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xB30
Makoto「... Ah, no... it's just, um, what I think.」%K%P

0xB3C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xB48
Makoto「... U-Um... Please don't think too much about it.」%K%P

0xB54
Izumi「... Hee hee, Makoto-kun... are you interested in Kurumi?」%K%P

0xB60
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0xB6C
Izumi「Bullseye!」%K%P

0xB78
Makoto「Y-You're wrong... Wh-What are you saying?」%K%P

0xB84
Izumi「Hee hee♪ You're getting embarrassed.」%K%P

0xB90
Izumi「Ge～ez, guess I have no choice. At times like these, it's%Nthe big sister's duty to pitch in and help～」%K%P

0xB9C
Makoto「P-Please stop...」%K%P

0xBA8
Izumi「Heh heh～♪ Just honestly confess to her.」%K%P

0xBB4
Izumi-san says this with an impish face while poking me%Nwith her index finger.%K%P

0xBC0
... I had no idea that Izumi-san had this childish side...%K%P

0xBD4
Makoto「Um... what are your hobbies, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xBE8
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xBF4
Makoto「Ah, no... I was just wondering... that's all.」%K%P

0xC00
Izumi「Hee hee! That sounds kinda like a question at an%Narranged marriage interview.」%K%P

0xC0C
Makoto「I... I suppose so.」%K%P

0xC18
Izumi「... Let's see... Lately, I've been into swimming.」%K%P

0xC24
Izumi「I often use this pool for that.」%K%P

0xC30
Makoto「I see... So that's why you're a fast swimmer...」%K%P

0xC3C
Izumi「In college, I became obsessed with cars...」%K%P

0xC48
Makoto「Wow... so you have your license?」%K%P

0xC54
Izumi「Of course♪ I may not look like it, but I did a lot of these%Ntypes of things when I was young.」%K%P

0xC60
Makoto「You're still pretty young now...」%K%P

0xC74
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0xC80
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xC8C
Izumi「It's already been six times...」%K%P

0xC98
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xCA4
Izumi「That I've had my license suspended.」%K%P

0xCB0
Makoto「... Come again?」%K%P

0xCC4
Izumi「It's strange～. Even though I have every intention of%Nbeing a safe driver...」%K%P

0xCD0
A suspended license...%K%N

0xCDC
In other words, because she violated traffic laws, she's%Nbeen unable to use her driver's license and forbidden%Nto drive by penal regulations.%K%P

0xCE8
Makoto「Wh-What did you do?」%K%P

0xCF4
Izumi「Huh? Nothing really... I was just driving normally.」%K%P

0xD00
Makoto「If that's the case, then why were you pulled over?」%K%P

0xD0C
Izumi「Well... you see... my blood got riled up.」%K%P

0xD18
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0xD24
Izumi「I saw a white motorcycle... and my blood got riled up...」%K%P

0xD30
Izumi「But then, I suddenly regained my senses...」%K%P

0xD3C
Makoto「That's enough... I get it...」%K%P

0xD48
...%K%P

0xD54
Some "safe driver" she was...%K%N

0xD60
She raced the white motorcycle, and went completely%Nover the speed limit, didn't she?%K%P

0xD6C
The same gentle Izumi-san who is tilting her head right%Nnow...%K%N

0xD78
The scene of Izumi-san racing the white motorcycle%Ninstantly flashes in my head.%K%P

0xD8C
Makoto「... Who do you respect the most?」%K%P

0xDA0
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xDAC
... Wait, wh-what am I asking her!!?%K%P

0xDB8
Izumi「... Let's see.」%K%P

0xDC4
Izumi-san takes my question seriously and thoughtfully%Nponders on an answer.%K%P

0xDD0
Izumi「... Sherlock Holmes.」%K%P

0xDDC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xDE8
Izumi「Sherlock Holmes. That's the person I respect the most.」%K%P

0xDF4
Makoto「... Ah, but...」%K%P

0xE00
He's not real, he's just a fictional character created by%NArthur Conan Doyle, isn't he?%K%N

0xE0C
I'm about to say this, but Izumi-san continues without%Nmissing a beat.%K%P

0xE18
Izumi「I admired him. There was a time where I thought I wanted%Nto become a detective in the future...」%K%P

0xE24
Izumi「His excellent perception that would allow him to not%Noverlook even the smallest amount of evidence...」%K%P

0xE30
Izumi「His endless deductive skills, which he would use to%Nderive tricks from those small amounts of evidence...」%K%P

0xE3C
Izumi「And his fortitude, which wouldn't allow him to give up until%Nthe end...」%K%P

0xE48
Izumi「Ah... He's so amazing～. Don't you think so?」%K%P

0xE54
Makoto「Y-Yeah... sure.」%K%P

0xE60
I never read the stories, so I can't really relate.%K%N

0xE6C
This isn't helping me to get to know Izumi-san better.%K%P

0xE88
Makoto「Izumi-san, do you have a boyfriend?」%K%P

0xE9C
Izumi「Huh～? Normally, you shouldn't ask such an insensitive%Nquestion without a lead-in.」%K%P

0xEB0
Izumi「What if I had been dumped recently? That question would%Nhave reopened sore wounds.」%K%P

0xEBC
... Right. That's what I thought... wait, what? Dumped?%K%P

0xEC8
Makoto「Izumi-san... were you dumped recently?」%K%P

0xEDC
Izumi「Hee hee... Do you want to know?」%K%P

0xEE8
I eagerly nod.%K%P

0xEF4
Izumi「Unfortunately, I haven't been been dumped.」%K%P

0xF00
Makoto「Unfortunately... Wait, isn't that a good thing?」%K%P

0xF0C
Izumi「Not really... I never said I was going out with someone,%Nafter all...」%K%P

0xF18
Makoto「Huh? You don't have a boyfriend?」%K%P

0xF24
Izumi「Well, sorry to disappoint you.」%K%P

0xF30
Izumi-san objects with a pout.%K%P

0xF3C
It kinda reminds me of something Kurumi would do.%K%P

0xF48
Makoto「No... that's not what I...」%K%P

0xF54
Izumi「Hee hee♪ Just kidding!」%K%P

0xF60
Izumi「Well, I don't have one right now... But I'm so busy%Neveryday anyway that I'm not really interested in one at%Nthe moment...」%K%P

0xF6C
Izumi「Hee hee... but perhaps that's a good thing?」%K%P

0xF78
Izumi-san tilts her head and gives me a mischievous%Nsmile.%K%P

0xF84
... A thought occurs to me as I look at her.%K%P

0xF90
(How does Izumi-san see me?)%K%P

0xFA4
... Izumi... Morino...%K%P

0xFB0
... Huh?%K%P

0xFBC
It then hits me. I remember where I've heard the name%N"Morino" before.%K%N

0xFC8
That was why I thought her name was familiar.%K%P

0xFD4
... I've finally remembered!%K%P

0xFE0
Makoto「... Now that I think about it, your last name is 'Morino', right?」%K%P

0xFEC
Makoto「You have the same last name as Dr. Morino, the world%Nfamous authority on genetic engineering.」%K%P

0x1000
Izumi「Wow, you're well informed.」%K%P

0x100C
Makoto「Yes, I learned about it at school...」%K%P

0x1018
Izumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x1024
Izumi「He's my father.」%K%P

0x1030
Makoto「Oh, so that's it. It's only natural you'd have the same last%Nname then...」%K%P

0x103C
... Wait, her father?%K%P

0x1048
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!!!?%K%P

0x1054
Makoto「You said 'my father'... so THE Dr. Morino is your father!?」%K%P

0x1060
Izumi「Is that... strange?」%K%P

0x106C
Makoto「No... It's not that...」%K%P

0x1078
It's just surprising...%K%P

0x1084
No, this is quite possibly the most startling thing I've%Never heard in my entire life.%K%P

0x1090
Izumi「It seems like he's a very famous person, but at home,%Nhe's just a normal father... probably.」%K%P

0x109C
Izumi「After getting out of the bath, he loiters around in his%Nunderwear...」%K%P

0x10A8
... I guess it's a small world after all...%K%P

0x10B4
No, but Izumi-san said "it seems like he's a very famous%Nperson"... Doesn't she know just how famous he is...?%K%P

0x111C
Izumi「... Ah!!」%K%P

0x1128
Suddenly, Izumi-san springs to her feet.%K%P

0x1134
Makoto「Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x1140
Izumi「Well... you see... I have to make a phone call.」%K%P

0x114C
Makoto「A phone call?」%K%P

0x1160
Izumi「I might have forgotten to lock the backdoor. I have to%Ncall Kurumi just to make sure.」%K%P

0x116C
Makoto「If Kurumi's there, then shouldn't it be all right?」%K%P

0x1178
Izumi「Yes... But I just want to be safe.」%K%P

0x1184
Izumi「Well then, I'll see you later, Makoto-kun♪」%K%P

0x11A8
Yuka「Huh～? Makoto?」%K%P

0x11D8
... After parting with Izumi-san, I'm feeling thirsty, so I go to%Nget a drink.%K%P

0x11E4
And there, I met up with Yuka.%K%P

0x11F0
She's still holding a glass of beer in her hand...%K%P

0x11FC
Yuka「What's wrong? Your face looks scary.」%K%P

0x1208
Makoto「... Have you already forgotten?!」%K%P

0x1214
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x1220
Makoto「Earlier, when Izumi-san and I were racing in the pool...」%K%P

0x1234
Yuka「Oh～～! Right right right right right...」%K%P

0x1240
Makoto「... You really get on my nerves sometimes, you know?」%K%P

0x124C
