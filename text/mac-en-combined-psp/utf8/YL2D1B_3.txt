But I can't wipe this last smudge of uneasiness from me.%K%P

0x8C
Last time, Yuka also said "Don't come back here [the%Nshrine] again"...%K%P

0x98
In spite of that, Yuka went there.%K%P

0xA4
Yesterday... no, on the morning of the last April 6th, on%Nthe tip of that cliff, Yuka said this...%K%P

0xB0
"I wanted to go back to the past, no matter what."%K%P

0xBC
―I wanted... to go back to the past...?%K%P

0xC8
―Why??%K%P

0xD4
The waves breaking onto the pier are still calm right now.%K%P

0xE0
Yuka and I are sitting on the staircase right above it.%K%P

0xEC
Yuka's hair sways in the gentle breeze as she sits next%Nto me.%K%P

0xF8
I make up my mind, and decide to ask the question that's%Nbeen eating away at me.%K%P

0x104
Makoto「Say, Yuka? There's something I want you to tell me...」%K%P

0x110
Yuka「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x11C
Makoto「Yuka... you said this behind the shrine, right? 'I wanted to%Ngo back to the past, no matter what'...」%K%P

0x128
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x134
Makoto「Would you tell me the reason why you wanted to return%Nto the past?」%K%P

0x140
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「Hey, you're still planning on keeping it a secret this late%Nin the game?」%K%P

0x160
Yuka「It's not... like that...」%K%P

0x16C
Makoto「Then why...?」%K%P

0x178
Yuka「... I understand. I'll tell you...」%K%P

0x184
Yuka「But before that―」%K%P

0x190
Makoto「Yuka! You've been saying 'but before that' way too many%Ntimes!」%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「You're always trying to postpone questions.」%K%P

0x1A8
Makoto「Earlier, at the tennis court, I asked you... 'Why can't we tell%Nthe others the truth?'... You still haven't answered that%None.」%K%P

0x1BC
Yuka「That's your fault, Makoto.」%K%P

0x1C8
Yuka「You interrupted the conversation and suddenly brought%Nus here...」%K%P

0x1D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1E0
Yuka「The reason we can't tell the others the truth... is simple.」%K%P

0x1EC
Yuka「It's dangerous.」%K%P

0x1F8
Makoto「Dangerous?」%K%P

0x204
Yuka「Think about it carefully, will you?」%K%P

0x210
Yuka「How are we gonna expect them to believe us about this%Nstrange reality, if we tell them?」%K%P

0x21C
Yuka「To win their trust, we'd have to tell them everything,%Nwouldn't you say?」%K%P

0x228
Makoto「Yeah... That's true...」%K%P

0x23C
Yuka「Anything and everything... the time, the place, the%Ncircumstances, we'd have to tell them all of that, wouldn't%Nwe?」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「Yeah, I get that much...」%K%P

0x25C
Yuka「Then let me ask you this... if you were in the other's%Nposition, what would you do?」%K%P

0x268
Yuka「What would you do if someone told you strange stories%Nabout time travel and infinite loops...?」%K%P

0x274
Makoto「Well... I probably wouldn't believe it, at first...」%K%P

0x280
Yuka「Right? You'd think they were crazy.」%K%P

0x28C
Yuka「But as the story continues, you're presented with all%Nsorts of proof...」%K%P

0x2FC
Yuka「For example, let's say I made a prediction about%Nsomething in the future, something that everyone else%Nwould definitely not know about, and it came true...」%K%P

0x308
Yuka「If that happened, they'd you'd have to believe me, right?」%K%P

0x314
Makoto「Hmm... I wonder about that...」%K%P

0x35C
Yuka「Well, it would be all right even if you didn't.」%K%P

0x39C
Yuka「Anyway, for now, let's try assuming that you do believe%Nme.」%K%P

0x3A8
Yuka「'There's no room to doubt her story'... you think%Nsomething along those lines... So then, what would you%Nthink next?」%K%P

0x3B4
Makoto「... 'Shouldn't I go to confirm whether or not that story's%Ntrue?'」%K%P

0x3C0
Yuka「See? That's what I thought!」%K%P

0x3CC
Yuka「No matter how much we insisted, it's likely that the others%Nwouldn't believe us...」%K%P

0x3D8
Yuka「Even if they did believe us, wouldn't that just put them%Ninto danger?」%K%P

0x3E4
Yuka「People's curiosity is something a lot stronger than what%Nmost think.」%K%P

0x3F0
Yuka「Even if they knew it were dangerous, the others might go%Nto the shrine at the time specified to confirm its validity.」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「... I see... so that's it...」%K%P

0x418
I sigh as I mutter this.%K%P

0x424
Yuka「After all, this is our problem in the first place...」%K%P

0x430
Yuka「I don't... want to involve others...」%K%P

0x444
A sound argument.%K%N

0x450
I see no room to object.%K%P

0x478
Makoto「All right!」%K%P

0x484
With an enthusiastic shout, I stand up on the pier.%K%P

0x490
Makoto「Well then, shall we begin!?」%K%P

0x4A4
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x4B0
Yuka tilts her head.%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「Let's go, Yuka!」%K%P

0x4C8
I start to walk away.%K%P

0x4DC
Yuka「Geez... don't walk off without saying anything.」%K%P

0x4E8
Yuka「Where do you plan to go this time?」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「We'll make it...」%K%P

0x500
Yuka「Make...? Make what?」%K%P

0x50C
Makoto「That's obvious, isn't it...?」%K%P

0x520
Yuka「Hmm???」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「A free world...」%K%P

0x538
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x544
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x558
Yuka「Haah, that again...?」%K%P

0x56C
Although she says this, Yuka smiles and rushes over to%Nme.%K%P

0x578
Seeing Yuka's smile after a long time makes my heart feel%Nlike it's bouncing...%K%P

0x5D0
Yuka「So what's the plan?」%K%P

0x5DC
Yuka asks this while walking.%K%P

0x5E8
Makoto「Plan?」%K%P

0x5F4
Yuka「Your plan to make a free world!」%K%P

0x600
Makoto「Yeah... First, I think I'll try doing whatever I can ...」%K%P

0x60C
Yuka「Do you have any specific ideas?」%K%P

0x618
Makoto「I'm going to destroy the bells!」%K%P

0x624
I firmly declare this.%K%P

0x638
Yuka「H-Hold on!」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x650
Yuka「Are you serious about that...?」%K%P

0x65C
Makoto「Isn't that obvious? If those bells weren't there, none of%Nthis would have happened.」%K%P

0x668
Makoto「That's already been proven, hasn't it?」%K%P

0x674
Makoto「'The echoing bell/ Will free you from time' ―It was%Nwritten on that talisman...」%K%P

0x688
Yuka「See, we're clashing.」%K%P

0x694
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x6A0
Yuka「Our thoughts are differing!」%K%P

0x6AC
Yuka「Even though I said at the beginning that we should try%Nstraightening things out...」%K%P

0x6B8
Makoto「Then you're against destroying the bells?」%K%P

0x6CC
Yuka「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x6D8
Makoto「Why...?」%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「If we didn't have those bells, we... Ah!」%K%P

0x6F0
Makoto「That's right! There's something I still haven't asked you%Nyet!」%K%P

0x6FC
Yuka「The reason I didn't... throw away the bell?」%K%P

0x708
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x714
Yuka「That's...」%K%P

0x720
Yuka「That's because...」%K%P

0x780
Just then, Yuka's expression clouds over.%K%P

0x78C
It's like a rain cloud covering the sun... or a solar eclipse...%K%P

0x798
That very sudden change makes me feel uneasy.%K%P

0x7AC
Yuka「Because I remembered...」%K%P

0x7B8
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x7C4
Yuka「The palm from my dream...」%K%P

0x7D0
Yuka「I remembered... that it was yours...」%K%P

0x7DC
Yuka「That's why also why on the morning of the last 1st... I%Nheaded straight... for your room.」%K%P

0x7E8
"A dream where someone died."%K%P

0x7F4
―So in other words, that someone... was me...%K%P

0x800
Yuka「When I saw that you knew nothing, Makoto... I felt relieved,%Nand for a little while after that, I thought that 'it was just a%Ndream'...」%K%P

0x80C
Yuka「But the second time I saw that bell... the bell that the girl%Nhad on Viewpoint Park...」%K%P

0x818
Yuka「I couldn't help but grow uneasy...」%K%P

0x824
Yuka「What if you got the bell and something bad happened? I%Nwas worried...」%K%P

0x830
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x83C
Yuka「So I found that girl, and traded the bell for my keychain...」%K%P

0x848
Yuka「At first, I thought I'd try throwing it into the ocean...」%K%P

0x854
Yuka「So I went to the tip of Viewpoint Park to throw it...」%K%P

0x860
Yuka「But... I reconsidered it.」%K%P

0x86C
Yuka「After all, perhaps the waves might have carried it away%Nand caused it to wash up on some beach.」%K%P

0x878
Yuka「And obviously, I couldn't check to see if it really sunk to%Nthe bottom of the ocean or not...」%K%P

0x884
Yuka「I would just feel scared the whole time, with no way to get%Nrid of that fear...」%K%P

0x890
Yuka「So I thought that if I carried it... if I always carried it, it'd%Nbe all right...」%K%P

0x8AC
Makoto「... Then, during the barbecue, you...」%K%P

0x8B8
Yuka「Yeah. I had it...」%K%P

0x8C4
Yuka「But I felt that if I was somber, then you would suspect%Nme...」%K%P

0x8D0
Makoto「So that's why you were acting incredibly cheerful?」%K%P

0x8DC
Yuka「Of course, half of me was still having fun, but...」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x940
Yuka「Anyway, now it's your turn.」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x958
Yuka「Tell me why you had that bell...」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「Oh... that?」%K%P

0x970
Makoto「It was a present from Kurumi...」%K%P

0x984
"This is something Kurumi found on Moon Beach this%Nafternoon."%K%P

0x990
"It's very pretty, so she'll give it to you♪"%K%P

0x99C
I tell Yuka the contents of the letter.%K%P

0x9E0
Makoto「Well, in short, it seems there were two bells from the%Nbeginning.」%K%P

0x9EC
Makoto「The bell I found on the 1st and the bell you found on the%N3rd were different bells.」%K%P

0xA00
Makoto「I threw my bell away on the 1st, which washed up two%Ndays later, and that girl picked it up on the evening of%Nthe 3rd on Moon Beach.」%K%P

0xA14
Makoto「You threw your bell away on the 3rd, which washed up%Ntwo days later, and on the afternoon of the 5th, Kurumi%Npicked it up.」%K%P

0xA38
Makoto「So in the end, the bell I had was the one you threw away...」%K%P

0xA44
Makoto「And the bell you had was the one I threw away... That's%Nwhat happened.」%K%P

0xA60
Yuka「Hmm... I see...」%K%P

0xA6C
Makoto「She probably didn't have any ill will in giving it to me... But%Nthanks to that, things turned out this way...」%K%P

0xA78
Yuka「Then you're not going to thank her?」%K%P

0xA84
Makoto「Huh!? Why would I thank...」%K%P

0xA98
Yuka「Haah... You really don't get it...」%K%P

0xAA4
Makoto「???」%K%P

0xAB0
Yuka「If Kurumi-chan hadn't given you that bell, you'd be dead.」%K%P

0xABC
―The word "dead" pierces my chest.%K%P

0xAC8
Yuka「'The echoing bell/ Will free you from time'... so if you didn't%Nhave that bell...」%K%P

0xAD4
Makoto「I couldn't... have time traveled...」%K%P

0xAE8
Yuka「Yes.」%K%P

0xAF4
Yuka「We were able to be saved because our%Nconsciousnesses were flung to this time...」%K%P

0xB00
Yuka「Well, 'saved' might not be the best way to put it, but...」%K%P

0xB0C
Yuka「Anyway, if our consciousnesses had stayed at the%Nshrine on the 6th, then all that would have remained of%Nour existences would be our dead, physical bodies.」%K%P

0xB18
Yuka「In other words, in this flow of time, we're actually still%Nalive, but...」%K%P

0xB24
Yuka「In the flow of time connected to that April 6th, we're%Ndead... That's how it is.」%K%P

0xB30
Yuka「It's a bit hard to grasp, so I take it you're confused.」%K%P

0xB3C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB48
Yuka「Then try thinking about it like this.」%K%P

0xB5C
Yuka「Let's say there's this long, wide road that's a straight%Nline.」%K%P

0xB68
Yuka「On that road, there's seven cars moving. They're neatly%Nlined up side-by-side...」%K%P

0xB74
Yuka「Each car has one driver...」%K%P

0xB80
Yuka「Haruka, Saki, Kurumi-chan, Izumi-san, Okuhiko-kun, me, and%Nyou are the drivers.」%K%P

0xB8C
Yuka「And far behind those seven cars are another group of%Nseven cars, also lined up side-by-side.」%K%P

0xB98
Yuka「Driving those cars are a different Haruka, a different%NSaki, a different Kurumi-chan... a different version of%Neveryone are driving the cars ahead.」%K%P

0xBA4
Yuka「You get me so far?」%K%P

0xBB0
Makoto「... Y-Yeah.」%K%P

0xBC4
Yuka「Well then, at a certain time... suddenly, you and I have a%Nheart attack or something and die.」%K%P

0xBD0
Yuka「Our bodies die, but our consciousnesses don't. Instead,%Nthey slip into the bodies of our alternate selves driving%Nthe cars behind the first group.」%K%P

0xBDC
Yuka「We just continue to travel down the same road we were%Ndriving on up until now...」%K%P

0xBE8
Yuka「So what about the cars traveling in front?」%K%P

0xBF4
Yuka「Our corpses are still inside, continuing to travel down%Nforever...」%K%P

0xC10
Yuka「And that's how it is... Do you get it?」%K%P

0xC1C
Makoto「Well... more or less.」%K%P

0xC28
Makoto「In short, if I didn't get that bell from Kurumi, I would have%Nbeen squashed under that collapsed shrine, and my%Nconsciousness would have completely come to a stop...」%K%P

0xC34
Makoto「... I wouldn't be able to slip out of that car, and my%Nconsciousness would have died with my body... isn't that%Nright?」%K%P

0xC40
Yuka slowly nods.%K%P

0xC4C
Yuka「And that's how it's connected to our earlier%Nconversation.」%K%P

0xC58
Yuka「That's why it's best not to destroy the bells.」%K%P

0xC64
Makoto「Huh???」%K%P

0xC78
Yuka「You don't get it?」%K%P

0xC84
Yuka「To us, those bells are our last fortress... they're literally%Nour 'lifelines'.」%K%P

0xC90
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC9C
Yuka「'If, by any chance, the same events occur on this April%N6th...'... you said that at the harbor...」%K%P

0xCB0
Yuka「If we don't have the bell at that 'by any chance' time...」%K%P

0xCBC
Yuka「We won't just lose a free world, we'll lose the world itself.」%K%P

0xCC8
Makoto「It'll mean the complete annihilation of our%Nconsciousnesses...」%K%P

0xCD4
Yuka「By changing history from now on, I think it'll get difficult to%Npredict what will happen on that day.」%K%P

0xCE0
Makoto「So basically... they're insurance?」%K%P

0xCEC
Makoto「It's best to have a lifeline to hold on to just to be safe?」%K%P

0xD00
Yuka「Yeah...」%K%P

0xD0C
Yuka「Wouldn't it be better if our first priority were finding the%Nbells instead of destroying them?」%K%P

0xD18
Yuka「That's... what I think...」%K%P

0xDA4
Yuka and I arrive at Moon Beach, and immediately begin%Nsearching for the bell.%K%P

0xDB8
Yuka「Hey, are you sure that it's around here?」%K%P

0xDC4
Makoto「I'm sure! I definitely picked it up around here!」%K%P

0xDD8
Yuka「Hmm... but that's not very reliable.」%K%P

0xDE4
Yuka「It's been almost six days since you found it, after all...」%K%P

0xDF0
Scattered on the beach with us is seaweed, fragments%Nof seashells, and scraps of driftwood.%K%P

0xDFC
If the waves were breaking onto shore a little bit further,%Nthey'd be soaking my ankles.%K%P

0xE08
In these circumstances, finding such a small bell might%Nbe next to impossible.%K%P

0xE1C
Yuka「Besides, didn't you find it at night?」%K%P

0xE28
Yuka「If that's the case, it means the scenery is very different%Nthan...」%K%P

0xE4C
Yuka stops in mid-sentence, and eats the rest of her%Nwords.%K%P

0xE58
Her eyes narrow as she glares at the wet sand.%K%P

0xE6C
As if she's being lured in by something, Yuka walks over%Nto the point she's staring at...%K%P

0xE78
She slowly leans over and picks up something.%K%P

0xE84
Yuka「Found it...」%K%P

0xE90
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xEA4
Yuka「I found it... I found it! Look♪」%K%P

0xEB0
Yuka pinches something in her fingers, and shows it to%Nme.%K%P

0xEC4
Its metal surface that emits a cold light... the light crimson%Nstring...%K%P

0xED0
This is definitely "that bell".%K%P

0xEF8
The bells sways in the wind, and rings out once.%K%P

0xF30
Yuka「See?♪」%K%P

0xF3C
Yuka places the bell in my palm as she smiles like there's%Nno tomorrow.%K%P

0xF48
Makoto「Th... That's right!」%K%P

0xF54
Makoto「This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it!」%K%P

0xF60
Makoto「All right! One lifeline down!!」%K%P

0xF6C
My heart is so filled with joy that I just want to shout it all%Nout.%K%P

0xF78
I hold the damp bell up towards the sky.%K%P

0xF84
The sparkling rays of the afternoon sun pierce my eyes,%Nforcing me to squint.%K%P

0xF98
Yuka「Um... I don't mind that you're happy and all, but...」%K%P

0xFA4
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0xFB0
Yuka「Aren't you going to give me a thank you or something?」%K%P

0xFBC
Makoto「Yeah! You're great, Yuka! You're awesome! Fantastic!」%K%P

0xFD0
I say that as I muss Yuka's hair, messing it up.%K%P

0xFDC
Yuka「Geez, what are you doing～」%K%P

0xFE8
In an attempt to get away from my hand, Yuka bends%Nover while desperately trying to fix her hair.%K%P

0xFFC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1008
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1014
We are silent for a short time...%K%P

0x1028
I reach out to muss Yuka's hair again.%K%P

0x1034
Yuka「G-Geez, stop it!」%K%P

0x1048
While holding down her hair with one hand, she uses the%Nother to launch a counterattack...%K%P

0x105C
I instantly intercept it, blocking her.%K%P

0x1068
I grasp Yuka's wrist and open up her palm.%K%P

0x1074
Makoto「Well then, take the bell...」%K%P

0x1080
As I say this, I place the bell in Yuka's palm.%K%P

0x108C
Yuka grasps the bell while wrapped up in confusion.%K%P

0x1098
Yuka「... Huh?」%K%P

0x10A4
Makoto「You found this bell.」%K%P

0x10B0
Makoto「So this is yours.」%K%P

0x10BC
Yuka「... But―」%K%P

0x10C8
Makoto「Didn't I say it before?」%K%P

0x10D4
Makoto「Men ought to protect women― that's how it's been for%Nages.」%K%P

0x10E8
Yuka purses her lips, her eyes swaying.%K%P

0x10F4
I see her cheeks turn a faint red color.%K%P

0x1100
Makoto「All right! Let's find the second one!」%K%P

0x110C
I say this cheerfully as I mess up Yuka's hair, again.%K%P

0x1118
Yuka takes a moment to fix it...%K%P

0x1150
For now, we've been able to find the first lifeline.%K%P

0x115C
I realize that I now no longer feel fear towards the bell.%NRather, I feel relieved.%K%P

0x1168
When I think about it, it's not like the bell was the direct%Ncause of that tragedy.%K%P

0x1174
Rather, as Yuka said, it's because we had them that our%Nlives were saved.%K%P

0x1180
So by having the bell, there's no need to get extremely%Nscared or pessimistic.%K%P

0x118C
In other words, even with that bell, we can change%Nhistory.%K%P

0x1198
That's the only thing I can declare with confidence...%K%P

0x121C
And so, we're looking for our second lifeline.%K%P

0x1228
It's been a long while since we found the first bell.%K%P

0x1234
Makoto「I guess it's still in the ocean.」%K%P

0x1240
Makoto「It probably won't wash up until the 3rd.」%K%P

0x124C
I turn around to find Yuka out of earshot, searching for%Nthe bell on the tip of Moon Beach.%K%P

0x1258
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0x1264
Exhausted, I sit down by the banks of the beach with a%Nthump.%K%P

0x127C
While she's searching, I notice Lunabeach in the corner%Nof my vision, and can't help thinking about it.%K%P

0x1288
(Izumi-san... I wonder what she's doing.)%K%P

0x1294
We don't have a reason to avoid going to Lunabeach,%Nbut on the other hand, we don't have a reason to show%Nourselves to her and Kurumi right now either.%K%P

0x12A0
We're wondering if it might be all right if we change%Nhistory by never meeting Izumi and Kurumi...%K%P

0x12AC
... But because of the incident this morning, they at least%Nknow we're at the lodge already.%K%P

0x12B8
Yuka and I agreed that we should focus on searching%Nfor the bell, so we're trying our best not to approach%NLunabeach.%K%P

0x12C4
(If we don't find it here, the only place left to search is%Naround Lunabeach...)%K%P

0x12D0
(Should I try going?)%K%P

0x12DC
(If I go, even if I meet the sisters, it's not like I can't just%Nmake up a lie or two.)%K%P

0x12E8
With that thought in mind, I place one hand on the ground%Nand quickly stand up...%K%P

0x12F4
Just then...%K%P

0x1318
Okuhiko「What are you doing here...?」%K%P

0x1324
... I see Okuhiko standing on top of the banks.%K%P

0x1338
He then jumps down onto the sand.%K%P

0x134C
Okuhiko「Weren't you playing tennis?」%K%P

0x1358
Makoto「We finished a while ago.」%K%P

0x1364
Okuhiko「Hmm...」%K%P

0x1378
Okuhiko「Oh! Yuka-chan's here too!」%K%P

0x138C
Okuhiko「Hey! Yuka-chan♪」%K%P

0x13A0
Okuhiko runs over towards her.%K%P

0x13BC
―And, at that time!%K%P

0x1408
I hear a loud thud from behind me, causing me to turn%Naround.%K%P

0x1414
On the sandy beach is Haruka, who has hit the ground.%K%P

0x1420
A cloud of dust soundlessly stirs up into the empty sky.%K%P

0x142C
Makoto「Haah...」%K%P

0x1438
I sigh and laugh at the same time.%K%P

0x1444
This is nothing to be surprised about anymore.%K%P

0x1450
Of course this would happen...%K%P

0x145C
I walk over to the confused Haruka's side, take her hand,%Nand help her up.%K%P

0x1468
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x1474
I say this on purpose.%K%P

0x1480
I guess, when I wasn't paying attention, I subconsciously%Ndecided I might be able to let myself enjoy this reality.%K%P

0x148C
In response to my question, Haruka gives me a short nod.%K%P

0x1498
The signs of her trying to cover up her embarrassment...%NThe blush on her cheeks... This is kinda nostalgic...%K%P

0x14A4
As if trying to cover up her trembling, she quickly gets%Nto her feet and moves past me.%K%P

0x14B8
I suddenly look up at the western skies, beautifully dyed%Nin a mad red glow.%K%P

0x14C4
The sound of the waves breaking on shore sound%Ngentler than a lullaby...%K%P

0x155C
―After that...%K%N

0x1568
Yuka and I join up with Haruka and Okuhiko, and proceed%Nto Lunabeach.%K%N

0x1574
As I mentioned earlier, we don't have a reason to avoid%Nthe place.%K%N

0x1580
Besides...%K%N

0x158C
... it'd feel kinda lonely.%K%P

0x15A0
If we don't go to Lunabeach right now, we might not be%Nable to meet Saki again for the rest of eternity.%K%N

0x15AC
And if we don't go to Lunabeach in these next six days,%NIzumi-san will continue to go on with her life not knowing%Nwho we are.%K%N

0x15B8
Kurumi's the same. She'll probably soon completely%Nforget the faces of people she only met once.%K%N

0x15C4
That's... just sad...%K%P

0x15D8
In the last six days...%K%N

0x15E4
we did a lot of fun things.%K%N

0x15F0
I don't want to lose all of that.%K%N

0x15FC
Saki caused a lot of problems for us, but on the other%Nhand, if we can resolve her problems, the next six days%Nshould be able to go by peacefully.%K%N%N

0x1608
(I've got to think about everything positively!)%K%P

0x161C
That's how I feel.

0x1628
―I want to turn back time!%K%N%N

0x1634
Even though they know that's impossible, everyone's%Nwished for that once or twice in their life.%K%N

0x1640
And now, it's happening in reality.%K%P

0x1654
Only Yuka and I can redo the things we regretted in%Nthose six days.%K%N

0x1660
If I think that way, then, setting aside the infinite loop, I%Nfeel I don't have to keep thinking of the time travel as a%Nbad thing.%K%N

0x166C
On the contrary, I can use the current circumstances in%Na positive way.%K%P

0x1680
―I'll only change the bad events into good ones.%K%N%N

0x168C
It'll be a piece of cake.%K%N

0x1698
Even the flap of one butterfly's wings can cause a%Ntornado.%K%P

0x16AC
―I'm not scared!%K%N

0x16B8
―Everything will surely go well!%K%N

0x16C4
... I'm finally beginning to think that way.%K%N%N

0x16D0
(Yuka and I will see the sunrise of April 7th together.)%K%N%N

0x16DC
It seems I'm looking forward to that day...%K%P

0x1744
We go to Lunabeach, and introduce ourselves as if%Nwe're meeting them for the first time.%K%N

0x1750
Saki arrives, and busts Haruka by revealing her lie... the%Nlie that her name was "Asakura".%K%N

0x175C
I don't want to make the conversation complicated, so I%Ndecide not to tell them that they're short on rice.%K%N

0x1768
Well, I wanted to say it, but then Yuka gave a sharp glare%Nthe moment I tried to, so I gave up.%K%P

0x177C
Either way, it doesn't change the fact that I have to go%Nshopping again.%K%N

0x17B8
Just like last time, I go shopping with Yuka.%K%P

0x17CC
Just like last time, I go shopping with Haruka.%K%N

0x17D8
Haruka rides on the bike with me...%K%N

0x17E4
I feel two small objects press against my back...%K%N

0x17F0
Maybe I invited Haruka because I wanted to feel that%Nsensation again...%K%P

0x180C
Just like last time, I go shopping with Saki.%K%N

0x1818
This is kind of nostalgic...%K%N

0x1824
Of course, we don't use the bike.%K%N

0x1830
Though in retrospect, the bike falling was a rather%Npleasant memory...%K%N

0x183C
... But on the other hand, I don't feel like getting hurt%Nagain.%K%P

0x1850
Because we have to walk a long way, I have enough time%Nto talk to Saki about various things.%K%N

0x185C
Her time in middle school with Yuka...%K%N

0x1868
The story about the Magician's Portrait... I feel that Saki%Nis calmer than she was last time.%K%N

0x1874
Is it because I'm better at communicating with her?%K%P

0x1888
We have paella, pumpkin soup and Italian salad.%K%N

0x1894
I'll never get tired of that taste no matter how many times%NI eat it...%W%W%W%N%N

0x18A0
"Let's go to the heated pool at Tsukiya Hotel!"%K%N%N

0x18AC
I break the ice...%K%P

0x1968
... I also pretend not to know about Izumi-san falling into%Nthe pool.%K%P

0x1974
―I'll only change the bad events into good ones.%K%N%N

0x1980
Then what are the good ones?%K%N

0x198C
They're events that are to leave alone and not change.%K%P

0x19A0
I feel bad for Izumi-san, but this is also a precious%Nmemory of mine...%K%N

0x19AC
... We return to Lunabeach and promise to go to the pool%Ntomorrow.%K%N

0x19B8
We separate from Izumi-san and Kurumi there...%K%N

0x19C4
And then...%K%P

0x1A58
... Exhausted, I plop myself down into my bed.%K%P

0x1A64
As I doze off, something suddenly starts to bug me,%Npulling at the corners of my mind.%K%P

0x1A70
What is it...? What is it...?%K%P

0x1A7C
Although I'm thinking, I'm having trouble defeating this%Nstrong drowsiness.%K%P

0x1A88
As if I had an "off" switch, I close my eyes and fall%Nasleep almost instantly.%K%P
