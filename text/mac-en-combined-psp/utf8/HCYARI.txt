I exit the shop.%K%N

0x9C
Haruka is silently waiting there.%K%P

0xA8
Makoto「Well then, ready to go?」%K%P

0xB4
Haruka「Yes...」%K%P

0xC0
As we walk, I find myself being overwhelmed by Haruka's%Nindifference.%K%P

0xCC
Izumi「Wait a minute!」%K%P

0xD8
I watch as Izumi-san comes running out of the shop.%K%P

0xF4
Izumi「Sorry. I forgot to tell you that there's a bike by the side%Nof the shop. Please use it.」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「A bike? Is that really necessary?」%K%P

0x10C
Izumi「Well, even though it's not far on foot, you still have a lot%Nto bring back, right?」%K%P

0x118
Makoto「True. Carrying 22 pounds of rice while walking does%Nseem like a pain...」%K%P

0x12C
Izumi「The key's attached to it. Well then, you two take care.」%K%P

0x138
Makoto「Will do.」%K%P

0x14C
I politely wait for Izumi-san to leave before I walk towards%Nthe side of the shop.%K%P

0x158
Just then... The bike starts moving, then quickly goes%Nflying off. It's Haruka.%K%P

0x164
Makoto「Huh? Haruka, when did you-」%K%P

0x170
She doesn't reply or stop.%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「Hey, wait up! Man...!」%K%P

0x1A4
I instinctively start to run after her.%K%P

0x1B0
Haruka is getting farther away, despite my efforts to%Ncatch up. I desperately run faster.%K%P

0x1BC
However, she's pedaling way too hard for me to keep up.%K%P

0x1C8
Makoto「Hey, Haruka! I told you to wait!」%K%P

0x244
After that outburst, Haruka finally hits the brakes.%K%P

0x250
I catch up to her, but then she says...%K%P

0x264
Haruka「I can take care of this by myself...」%K%P

0x270
... Her words shock me.%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「You know, it kinda kills the purpose of me inviting you%Nalong if you go on without me.」%K%P

0x288
Haruka「... I can do this by myself.」%K%P

0x294
Makoto「Listen up, Haruka. There's only one bike. Do you%Nunderstand what that means?」%K%P

0x2A0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2AC
Makoto「That's why...」%K%P

0x2B8
Haruka「Then do you want to get on?」%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x2D0
Haruka「I think you might be able to fit on the luggage carrier.」%K

0x700
"Thanks, but I don't think I should."

0x70C
"Sounds like a plan... I guess."

0x318
Makoto「Thanks, but I don't think I should.」%K%P

0x324
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x330
Makoto「Try to understand my position. I was the one who-」%K%P

0x33C
Haruka「Nevermind, then.」%K%P

0x348
She gets ready to pedal again, wearing a calm%Nexpression. (Well, even if I DID invite her...) Swallowing my%Npride, I quickly jump onto the bike's luggage carrier.%K%P

0x354
Haruka「What? Are you going to ride?」%K%P

0x360
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x36C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x378
Makoto「Yes... I'll take you up on your offer...」%K%P

0x38C
Makoto「Sounds like a plan... I guess.」%K%P

0x398
I say this reluctantly.%K%P

0x3A4
(Why does it have to be this way?)%K%P

0x3B0
―And so, Haruka pedals the bike while I sit on the%Nluggage carrier, barely fitting.%K%P

0x3BC
This is a little pathetic and annoying, and... just a little bit%Nsad.%K%P

0x3C8
(We're so close, and yet she feels so distant...)%K%P

0x3D4
It bothers me.%K%P

0x424
I cram the large grocery bag into the bike's basket.%K%P

0x430
Just then, the front wheel begins to bend under the%Nweight of the rice. Figures. We did buy 22 pounds of it,%Nafter all.%K%P

0x444
Without giving me a glance, Haruka heads straight for the%Nbike again, with the same composure as earlier.%K%P

0x450
Makoto「Hold on.」%K%P

0x45C
Haruka「Hurry up and get on.」%K%P

0x468
No matter what, I can't let her handle the bike this time.%NNot with the bike in this condition.%K%P

0x474
And besides, Haruka's a girl. Even if she has an unusual%Nside to her, it's my duty as a man to help her in a%Nsituation like this...%K%P

0x480
Haruka「Are you staying?」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「Isn't it my turn?」%K%P

0x498
I imminently ask this.%K%P

0x4A4
Haruka「Huh?」%K%P

0x4B0
Makoto「Yeah. This time, I'll pedal. Okay?」%K%P

0x4BC
I help Haruka off the bike, and then grab its handles.%NHaruka turns around to face the luggage carrier.%K%P

0x4C8
Makoto「People have to help each other out, right?」%K%P

0x4D4
This might come back to bite me in the ass later on, but%Nwho cares?%K%P

0x4E0
Haruka「Help each other... out...」%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「Right. Anyway, get on.」%K%P

0x4F8
Haruka nods. She seems stubborn, but she can also be%Nsurprisingly obedient.%K%P

0x50C
I glance at Haruka, whose legs are dangling off one side%Nof the bike, and I feel warm inside.%K%P

0x550
Looks like it really did come back to bite me in the ass.%NThat is, letting Haruka ride on the luggage carrier.%K%P

0x55C
She's petite, and doesn't weigh much, but those 22%Npounds of rice sure do. My thigh muscles are burning... Is%Nthis much pain even normal?%K%P

0x568
Haruka「Should I get off?」%K%P

0x574
Haruka firmly grabs my waist from behind, waiting for an%Nanswer.%K%P

0x580
Makoto「No, I'm fine.」%K%P

0x58C
I hear a clink. That can't be good, but I can't just give up%Nnow!%K%P

0x598
Haruka「I think it would be logical for me to do so.」%K%P

0x5A4
Logical? Screw that.%K%P

0x5B0
Makoto「I said I'm fine! There's no way I'm stopping here!」%K%P

0x5BC
Haruka「Why are you angry?」%K%P

0x5C8
Makoto「Enough already! Look, I said I would do this, so I'm%Ndefinitely doing it...!」%K%P

0x5D4
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0x5E0
Curious, I try to get a glimpse of her facial expression.%K%P

0x5EC
However, just then, the rear wheel slips and collapses%Nfrom the pressure.%K%P

0x5F8
Haruka「Look out!」%K%P

0x604
Haruka clings to me with all her might. I feel two soft%Nobjects bulge against me. My whole body then burns up%Nwith extreme heat...%K%P
