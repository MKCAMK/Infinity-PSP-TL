And so, in order to prepare for the barbecue, it's been%Ndecided that I'll go to the shopping district to go buy%Nsome things.%K%P

0x80
The things I must buy are a large quantity of: beef, green%Npeppers, onions, oil, and beer.%K%P

0x8C
Carrying all of that on the way back while walking would%Nnot be an easy task.%K%P

0x98
That's why Izumi-san decided to let me borrow her%Nbicycle.%K%P

0xA4
I sit in the saddle, put my feet on the pedals, and go on%Nmy way...%K%P

0xB0
... Or so I plan to, but suddenly, I remember something.%K%P

0xBC
(Now that I think about it, don't we have some leftover%Nonions from yesterday at the lodge?)%K%P

0xC8
Kurumi asked for no onions in the food, so we didn't use%Nthem for dinner.%K%P

0xD4
Well then, what should I do?%K

0xB08
Return to the lodge.

0xB14
Head for the shopping district.

0x11C
(Buying more would just be a waste...)%K%P

0x128
(... I guess I'll just go to the lodge to pick them up.)%K%P

0x134
I turn the bike's front wheel to the west, and start%Nheading towards the lodge.%K%P

0x174
I breathlessly ascend the long hill road.%K%P

0x180
I put the kickstand up, climb the short staircase, and%Nopen the lodge's door.%K%P

0x1D4
Okuhiko「I... Ishihara!」%K%P

0x1E0
Okuhiko suddenly shouts this.%K%P

0x1F4
Okuhiko, who was lying down on the living room sofa,%Njumps to his feet like he's panicking.%K%P

0x200
Makoto「Huh? Okuhiko... what are you doing here?」%K%P

0x20C
Okuhiko「'What'? ... I'm allowed to do whatever I want, right?」%K%P

0x218
As Okuhiko says this, he hides something he was holding%Nbehind his back.%K%P

0x224
Makoto「Well, that's true...」%K%P

0x238
Okuhiko「Anyway, Ishihara, why did you come here?」%K%P

0x244
Makoto「Oh, right, I almost forgot.」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「I came here for some onions...」%K%P

0x264
Okuhiko「Huh? ... Onions?」%K%P

0x270
Makoto「Yeah. Izumi-san wanted them for the barbecue tonight.」%K%P

0x27C
As I answer, I head into the kitchen.%K%P

0x2D4
(Oh, here they are...)%K%P

0x2E0
There's a plastic bag besides the refrigerator with a%Nlarge number of onions in it.%K%P

0x2EC
I take the plastic bag and return to the living room.%K%P

0x344
Makoto「See you later, Okuhiko...」%K%P

0x350
And as I'm talking!%K%P

0x35C
―Rip!%K%P

0x368
―Roll, roll, roll, roll...!%K%P

0x374
Unable to bear the weight of the onions any longer, the%Nhandle of the plastic bag tears off.%K%P

0x380
The onions inside scatter and roll over the floor.%K%P

0x394
Okuhiko「Oh... for God's sake...」%K%P

0x3A0
Okuhiko「Of course that would happen if there were so many in%Nthere.」%K%P

0x3B4
While grumbling to himself, Okuhiko slowly bends over to%Nhelp.%K%P

0x3C0
Just then...%K%P

0x3DC
―Wham.%K%P

0x3E8
Something falls to the floor.%K%P

0x3F4
At Okuhiko's feet... is a thick file.%K%P

0x400
It seems that when Okuhiko bent over, it fell from his back.%K%P

0x414
Okuhiko「Ah...」%K%P

0x420
Okuhiko frantically picks up the file and hides it behind%Nhis back.%K%P

0x42C
Makoto「Huh? Why are you panicking, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x438
Okuhiko「I'm not... panicking...」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x450
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x45C
Makoto「Ah ha... I see...」%K%P

0x468
Makoto「It's something you don't want to show me... Is it a%Nscrapbook full of indecent photos?」%K%P

0x47C
Okuhiko「Y-You're wrong... that's not-」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「Bulls-eye, huh?」%K%P

0x49C
Okuhiko「Didn't I say you were wrong!? Mind your own business!」%K%P

0x4A8
Makoto「If I'm wrong, then when why can't you show me?」%K%P

0x4BC
As I say this, I reach out behind Okuhiko's back.%K%P

0x4C8
Okuhiko「I-Idiot! What're you doing!? Stop it, Ishihara!」%K%P

0x4D4
Our arms become entangled as we struggle for the file.%K%P

0x4E0
Before long...%K%P

0x4EC
Bam!%K%P

0x4F8
... At the end of the fight, I've successfully taken the file%Nfrom Okuhiko's hands.%K%P

0x504
Makoto「Let's have a look...」%K%P

0x510
I glance at the first page of the file.%K%P

0x51C
"Cur▲ Syndrome Inquiry"%K%P

0x528
It's written in a large, black Gothic font.%K%P

0x534
Makoto「Cur▲ Syndrome? What the hell's that?」%K%P

0x540
This time, I flip open to a random page and try reading it.%K%P

0x568
"2: Paramnesia... (1) False Memory Syndrome."%K%P

0x574
"Actual experiences are recalled, but in a fictional,%Nexaggerated, dramatized way."%K%P

0x580
"This is especially the case with those with hysterical%Npersonalities who crave attention, impostors, or%Npossibly liars―the pattern is that they all deceive%Nothers..."%K%P

0x58C
"While they deliberately mix personal experiences with%Nimaginary, exaggerated stories as they talk..."%K%P

0x598
"... they become unable to tell if their story was real or%Nfake, and accidentally end up completely turning into%Nthe main character of that story."%K%P

0x5A4
"This is called Mythomania (Pseudologia Fantastica)."%K%P

0x5C0
Makoto「... Huh???」%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「What the hell is this? Isn't this a psychiatry report?」%K%P

0x5E0
Okuhiko「That's right. Is there something wrong with a Psychology%Nstudent reading a psychiatry report?」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「No, nothing at all, but... this was just a bit surprising...」%K%P

0x61C
Okuhiko「Surprising? ... Hey, hey, don't put me in the same%Ncategory as you.」%K%P

0x628
Okuhiko「I'm a hard worker, despite my looks.」%K%P

0x634
Okuhiko「I just don't want everyone to see me working so hard.」%K%P

0x640
Okuhiko says that as he quickly snatches the file from%Nmy hands.%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「Hmm... a hard worker, huh...」%K%P

0x658
As I mutter this, I pick up the plastic bag with the torn%Nhandle, and start to gather all of the onions.%K%P

0x664
Before long, I clean all the onions, stuff them in the bag,%Nand while holding it against my chest...%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Well then, I'll see you later. Don't miss the meeting time.」%K%P

0x67C
... With that, I leave the lodge...%K%P

0x6D4
For now, I'll drop off the onions at Lunabeach, and head%Nfor the shopping district.%K%P

0x70C
I turn my elbows while steering the handles as I blithely%Nride the bike while thinking about what happened earlier.%K%P

0x718
(Even so, Okuhiko, of all people...)%K%P

0x724
(... To think he'd still be studying even while at the camp.)%K%P

0x730
(...)%K%P

0x73C
(Huh? Hold on.)%K%P

0x748
(Now that I think about it, this is a "Seminar" Camp, isn't it?)%K%P

0x754
(Then isn't it really strange that we're not doing any kind%Nof studying at all?)%K%P

0x760
(Hmm...)%K%P

0x76C
(Studying, huh...)%K%P

0x778
(Even though I'm a Psychology student, I didn't%Nunderstand any of that stuff about False Memory%NSyndrome or Mythomania.)%K%P

0x784
(Of course, to me, that "Cur▲ Syndrome" stuff may as%Nwell have been gibberish.)%K%P

0x790
(Cur▲ Syndrome...)%K%P

0x79C
(Just what is that supposed to mean?)%K%P

0x7A8
(I guess it's about time I got my shit together and study%Nseriously as well, or I'll be in real trouble...)%K%P

0x7E0
... ... ...%K%P

0x818
I arrive at the shopping district, and enter a small%Nsupermarket near the start of the road, where I find what%NI need rather quickly.%K%P

0x824
Makoto「Beef, green peppers, oil, and beer...」%K%P

0x838
(It'll just be a pain in the ass to go all the way back to%Nthe lodge...)%K%P

0x844
(... I'll guess I'll just try to buy the onions at the shopping%Ndistrict.)%K%P

0x850
With that decided, I immediately turn north and start%Npedaling the bike.%K%P

0x8A8
I arrive at the shopping district, and enter a small%Nsupermarket near the start of the road, where I find what%NI need rather quickly.%K%P

0x8B4
Makoto「Beef, green peppers, onions, oil, and beer...」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「... All right, I'm all set.」%K%P

0x8CC
I mutter this, and straddle over to the bike.%K%P

0x8D8
I put the food in the cage by the front wheel, and load%Nthe case of beer cans on the luggage carrier on the%Nback wheel.%K%P

0x8E4
―Why do I have to buy so much beer?%K%P

0x8F0
Before I went shopping, I asked Izumi-san this.%K%P

0x8FC
Her answer was...%K%P

0x910
Izumi「Because Yuka-chan requested it.」%K%P

0x924
(Oh brother...)%K%P

0x930
(We're finally having a barbecue, so do we really have to%Nlet Yuka spoil it...?)%K%P

0x93C
I shake off these uneasy thoughts, and begin to%Nenergetically pedal the bike.%K%P

0x96C
... ... ...%K%P

0x978
Before long, the sun is setting, and the promised time%Narrives.%K%P

0x984
We meet at Lunabeach, where we all pitch in carrying the%Ntools needed for the barbecue to Princess Beach.%K%P

0x990
And then...%K%P
