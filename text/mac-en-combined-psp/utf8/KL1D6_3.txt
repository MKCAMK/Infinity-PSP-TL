I ascend the long staircase.%K%N

0xD0
The night has been completely vanquished by the dawn.%K%N

0xDC
I can't see anyone in the shrine grounds, hazy from the%Nrain.%K%P

0xE8
The ground is violently pounded by swarms of large rain%Ndrops...%K%N

0xF4
The sound of the rainfall is so loud that it feels like it%Ncould erase the whole world itself.%K%P

0x100
I take a breath of the wet air.%K My nasal cavities are%Npierced by the cold.%K%P

0x10C
... The whole grounds have become one large water%Npuddle.%K%P

0x118
I take two steps, slowly walking into the puddle of water.%NThe cold sound of my footsteps as I walk across the%Nwater echoes in the mist.%K%P

0x124
I get closer and closer to the dim, white mirage-like%Nshrine.%K%N

0x130
Its vague features gradually start to become clearer.%K%P

0x13C
I can see that the door to the shrine has been thrown%Nopen.%K%N

0x148
Dust from inside the door flutters about in the darkness.%K%P

0x154
With each step forward that I take, the inner details of%Nthe shrine become clearer and clearer.%K%P

0x160
It's as if all the particles of darkness in the shrine%Ndisappeared swiftly and soundlessly, like they were%Nsucked up by something.%K%P

0x1C0
Before long...%K%N

0x1CC
... I find her.%K%P

0x21C
I see a girl silently standing still inside the shrine...%W%W%W%K%P

0x228
... It's Kurumi...%K%N

0x234
... Kurumi...%K%P

0x240
Makoto「KURUMI!!!」%K%P

0x24C
I kick off the ground.%K%N

0x258
I run in order to push my way through the pelting rain.%K%N

0x264
I use whatever energy I have left to sprint towards her.%K%P

0x270
Even though I trip and stumble over puddles, I still keep%Nrunning.%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「KURUMIIIIIIIII!!!」%K%P

0x288
I scream again.%K%N

0x294
But the ruthless sound of the rain drowns out my voice.%K%N

0x2A0
Kurumi doesn't notice me.%K%P

0x2AC
She's standing stock still in the middle of the shrine%Ndejectedly, as stiff as a doll.%K%P

0x2B8
... But I'm almost there.%K%N

0x2C4
I'm almost there... Kurumi is right before my eyes.%K%N

0x2D0
Just a few more steps, and I'll have reached that short%Nstaircase.%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0x2E8
Nearly out of breath, I barely manage to wring out my%Nvoice.%K%P

0x2F4
Kurumi... quietly turns around.%K%N

0x300
Gently, without a sound...%K%P

0x33C
Kurumi「Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x348
She... mutters this in a lonely voice...%K%N

0x354
―At that very instant!%K%P

0x3B8
The earth shakes.%K%N

0x3C4
I lose my footing and fall forward, crashing onto the%Nground face first.%K%P

0x3D0
It's a raging earthquake...%K%N

0x3DC
The violent tremors come in waves.%K%P

0x3E8
It feel like I'm in the belly of a writhing monster...%K%N

0x3F4
The suffering, anguished, raging earth...%K%N

0x400
The thick pillars make a creaking sound as they grate.%K%P

0x40C
Small splinters come falling from the ceiling as it tears%Napart.%K%N

0x418
When I look up, I see that the shrine is now slanting left%Nand right, like a swaying heat haze.%K%P

0x424
―It's collapsing...%K%N

0x430
―The shrine... is collapsing...%K%P

0x43C
(Kurumi...)%K%P

0x448
―At this rate, Kurumi will...!!!%K%N

0x454
I push myself up with my hands, but the moment I try to%Nstand up...%K%P

0x524
A mountain of rubble...%K%N

0x530
Where the shrine once stood is now a cruel mountain of%Nrubble.%K%P

0x53C
The broken pillars... the wreckage of the roof that's been%Nsmashed to pieces...%K%P

0x558
I start to reach for a thick plank of wood.%K%N

0x564
With all of my strength, I brace myself as I try to lift it.%K%P

0x570
However, the plank is way too heavy, and won't budge%Nan inch.%K%P

0x57C
I muster even more strength as I try to put everything%NI've got into lifting it.%K%N

0x588
The grave sound of creaking echoes.%K%P

0x594
... My hands, wet from the rain, slip.%K%P

0x5A0
My fingernails burst open and pop off.%K%N

0x5AC
I feel a sharp pain... bright red, fresh blood comes%Npouring from the fingertips that have had their nails torn%Noff.%K%P

0x5B8
Even so, I don't give up.%K%N

0x5C4
I mustn't be bothered with the pain.%K%N

0x5D0
I don't care if my bones break or if my flesh is torn off.%K%P

0x5DC
I'll use everything I've got... I put so much brutal power%Ninto my body that my blood vessels almost rupture, and%Nuse it to lift up the thick plank...%K%P

0x5F0
Kurumi...%K%N

0x5FC
Looking at Kurumi's ghastly pale, almost transparent%Ncheeks, I feel like she might shatter into a thousand%Npieces if I touched her cheek.%K%P

0x608
As if she were a doll made of glass...%K%N

0x614
Her heavily dangling palm is clutching onto a small%Nfragment of light.%K%P

0x630
―The bell.%K%N

0x63C
It's that bell...%K%N

0x648
That cold, silver light... That dull, crimson string...%K%P

0x654
Before long, the bell begins to quietly slip out of the%Npalm...%K%N

0x660
... It then... slips out and falls.%K%P

0x6B4
I bury my face into Kurumi's chest.%K%N

0x6C0
My body's trembling gradually intensifies.%K%P

0x6CC
In my arms, I can feel her cold, wet skin...%K%N

0x6D8
Her thin limbs are stiff...%K%N

0x6E4
This is Kurumi's... empty shell...%K%P

0x6F0
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0x6FC
My hoarse voice alone fills this empty void...%K%P

0x730
...%K%P

0x73C
Kurumi「Because the moon was all alone, it was lonely, and would%Ncry during the night. 'Sob, sob... sob, sob'...」%K%P

0x748
Kurumi「Even so, the moon was still lonely, and so its tears gave%Nbirth to children. A lot of children...」%K%P

0x754
Kurumi「The child of the moon and the sea, the jellyfish...」%K%P

0x760
Kurumi「Kurumi was looking at the jellyfish.」%K%P

0x77C
...%K%P

0x788
Kurumi「Kurumi's dream...」%K%P

0x794
Kurumi「Is to become a wife♪」%K%P

0x7A0
Kurumi「At night, Kurumi will bury her face in her husband's warm%Nchest... and sleep soundly...」%K%P

0x7AC
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x7B8
Kurumi「... Your chest... is it warm?」%K%P

0x7C4
...%K%P

0x7D0
Kurumi「It's done!♪」%K%P

0x7DC
Kurumi「Kurumi will call it Kurumi Unit 17!」%K%P

0x7E8
Kurumi「Ah... but this folding method is a trade secret. You%Nmustn't tell anyone about it, no matter what.」%K%P

0x7F4
Kurumi「Kurumi still hasn't told anyone either, so...」%K%P

0x800
...%K%P

0x80C
Kurumi「This is...」%K%P

0x818
Kurumi「... Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x824
Kurumi「This is Onii-chan when he's smiling!」%K%P

0x840
I put my hand into my pocket.%K%N

0x84C
I pull out the "me" out that Kurumi folded.%K%P

0x858
I place... "me" on my palm.%K%N

0x864
I grasp it with all my might...%K%P

0x88C
(Kurumi... why...)%K%P

0x898
Kurumi「Cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die If-you-lie...♪」%K%P

0x8A4
Kurumi「Ah... what should we do if you lie?」%K%P

0x8B0
Kurumi「Let's see...」%K%P

0x8BC
Kurumi「If you lie, kiss Kurumi on the cheek... okay?」%K%P

0x8C8
We made a promise, right...? We pinkie-swore it, didn't we...?%K%N

0x8D4
To go to a haunted house... together...%K%P

0x8E0
To the amusement park... What should I do...?%K%N

0x8EC
―What should I do, Kurumi!!?%K%P

0x8F8
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x904
Kurumi「Kurumi... wants to show you something, okay?」%K%P

0x910
Kurumi「If it's you, Onii-chan, then she can show you...」%K%P

0x91C
Kurumi「It's all right... you don't have to say anything...」%K%P

0x928
Kurumi「All you have to do is think 'Kurumi was selfish for wanting%Nto show it to me'...」%K%P

0x934
Kurumi「Just seeing it... is enough...」%K%P

0x940
Kurumi...%K%N

0x94C
I...%K%N

0x958
I...%K%P

0x964
Kurumi「Stop lying already!」%K%P

0x970
Kurumi「I hate you!」%K%P

0x97C
Kurumi「I HATE EVERYONE!!」%K%P

0x9C4
I curse the earth.%K%N

0x9D0
I curse the heavens. I curse God.%K%N

0x9DC
And... I feel disgust... hatred... and indignation... towards%Nmyself...%K%P

0x9E8
I tear at my chest, wanting to gouge out my heart and%Ncrush it as hard as I can with my own hands...%K%P

0x9F4
Without an outlet to voice my rage, my whole body%Nshudders as I try to restrain it.%K%N

0xA00
I gnaw and grind my molars, and dark blood comes%Noverflowing out of my mouth.%K%P

0xA0C
(If...)%K%P

0xA18
(If I could have one wish granted...)%K%P

0xA24
(It would be...)%K%P

0xA30
(To see Kurumi's angelic smile...)%K%P

0xA3C
(... once again...)%K%P

0xA58
I glare at the sky, and bare my teeth.%K%N

0xA64
As I scream at the top of my lungs, wringing out every%Nsingle emotion from within me...%K%P

0xA70
I soon...%K%N

0xA7C
begin to fall...%K%N

0xA88
to the bottom of hell...%K%P
