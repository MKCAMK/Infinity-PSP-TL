Yuka and I ate all of the "Mysterious Object", along with%Ntwo pieces each of the "charcoal", including Haruka and%NOkuhiko's share.%K%P

0x60
Right now, Yuka is happily humming while washing the%Ndishes.%K%P

0x6C
I think it's more of the fact that she can now say that%Nsomeone actually ate her cooking, rather than being full,%Nthat's the cause of her happiness.%K%P

0x78
In short, I became the sole sacrifice for that purpose.%K%P

0x84
Makoto「Ugh...」%K%P

0x90
I feel sick...%K%P

0x9C
I can feel my chest and throat filling up with nausea.%K%P

0xA8
I would rush to the bathroom as fast as I could, but if I%Nthrew up, I'd have to look at the monstrosity that nobody%Nshould ever have to suffer through seeing twice.%K%P

0xB4
I have to endure it... I have to wait until my stomach calms%Ndown.%K%P

0xC0
I swear that I'll never let Yuka cook ever again!%K%N

0xCC
I repeat this vow to myself 21 times.%K%P

0xF4
Just then, the doorbell rings from the front door.%K%P

0x100
―Huh?%K%P

0x10C
Our group has four members. Nobody else was%Nscheduled to come here except for us, right...?%K%P

0x118
As I squat down on the floor, I survey the surrounding%Narea restlessly.%K%P

0x124
Haruka is brushing her teeth in front of the sink.%K%P

0x130
Where's Okuhiko...?%K%P

0x13C
Okuhiko「Hey, Ishihara! Get the door. Our hands are full right now.」%K%P

0x148
I hear his voice coming from the kitchen.%K%P

0x154
It seems that Okuhiko is helping Yuka with the cleanup.%K%P

0x17C
Yuka「Come on Makoto, hurry up and answer it!」%K%P

0x188
Man...%K%P

0x194
(I don't want to cover the floor in vomit!)%K%P

0x1A0
Like an old man, I slowly wobble to my feet and stand up.%K%P

0x1AC
I take little steps to the front door while hunching over%Njust like one, too.%K%P

0x1B8
Makoto「Okay, I'm on it.」%K%P

0x1C4
I massage my stomach with my left hand while opening%Nthe door with my right.%K%P

0x25C
??「Thank you very much for your continued patronage～♪」%K%P

0x268
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x274
Standing in the doorway is an innocent-looking girl.%K%P

0x280
Judging from her appearance... I'd say she's probably a%Nmiddle-school student.%K%P

0x28C
Riding on top of her right palm is a square, silver colored%Nbag.%K%P

0x2A8
??「Here's the seafood pizza you ordered!」%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「Seafood pizza? I never ordered anything like that...」%K%P

0x2C0
??「What!?」%K%P

0x2CC
A disturbed expression clouds her face as she%Nsearches through her pocket with her free hand until%Nshe pulls out a scrap of paper.%K%P

0x2D8
??「But the receipt definitely says you ordered a 'Seafood%NPizza', didn't you?」%K%P

0x2E4
Suddenly, she stops speaking formally, making her feel%Nlike a little kid on an errand.%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「No, that's not what I mean. You see, I didn't order anything.」%K%P

0x2FC
??「But...」%K%P

0x308
She checks the receipt again.%K%P

0x314
??「... This is definitely the right address.」%K%P

0x320
As she says this, she shows me the receipt.%K%P

0x32C
However, there's no way I would have memorized the%Nlodge's address.%K%P

0x338
Makoto「Then wait a second.」%K%P

0x344
After telling her this, I turn around towards the kitchen.%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Did you order a pizza?」%K%P

0x388
Yuka「Why would I do that?」%K%P

0x394
Makoto「What about you, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x3A0
With his back turned to me, Okuhiko lightly waves his palm,%Nindicating a "no."%K%P

0x3AC
All that's left is Haruka...%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「Hey, Haruka!」%K%P

0x3C4
I shout inside towards the sink.%K%P

0x3D0
Haruka, who is still brushing her teeth, shakes her head.%K%P

0x3DC
Makoto「Didn't think so...」%K%P

0x3E8
Makoto「Well then, do any of you know this address?」%K%P

0x3F4
Yuka「It should be written on the nameplate, shouldn't it?」%K%P

0x400
Makoto「Nameplate?」%K%P

0x40C
Yuka「Yeah. It should be attached besides the front door...」%K%P

0x418
Makoto「I see. The nameplate, huh...」%K%P

0x424
I mutter this, and turn around again.%K%P

0x45C
I stick my head out of the door and check besides it.%K%P

0x468
She was right; there's a wooden nameplate there...%K%P

0x474
Makoto「Umm, could you show me that receipt again?」%K%P

0x480
??「Won't the pizza... get cold?」%K%P

0x48C
As she says this, she hands over the receipt.%K%P

0x498
I take it from her and compare it to the nameplate.%K%P

0x4A4
The nameplate says, "District 3, House 8, #1".%K%P

0x4B0
And written on the receipt is "3-8-1".%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x4C8
I take a closer look at them.%K%P

0x4D4
"District 3, House 8, #1" and "3-8-1".%K%P

0x4E0
... What's this???%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「... I don't think this is a '1', but a '7', right?」%K%P

0x4F8
??「What!?」%K%P

0x504
She immediately snatches the receipt from my hands.%K%P

0x510
??「3 and 8 and... 7?」%K%P

0x51C
??「Then, this isn't the Asakura house...」%K%P

0x528
...%K%P

0x534
Makoto「Aha ha ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x540
I unintentionally laugh.%K%P

0x54C
Of course! Why didn't I just check that first? Had I just%Nasked for the receiver's name, I could have cleared up%Nthis misunderstanding immediately!%K%P

0x558
Geez, I'm such a blockhead...%K%P

0x564
Makoto「Sorry, there isn't anyone here named Asaku...」%K%P

0x570
Okuhiko「Hold it right there!」%K%P

0x57C
That abrupt shout surprises the girl.%K%P

0x5BC
Makoto「What is it, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x5C8
Okuhiko had walked over without me noticing it, and is%Ncurrently standing next to me.%K%P

0x5DC
Okuhiko「Ah, thank you for all your trouble～」%K%P

0x5E8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x5FC
Okuhiko「I'm Okuhiko Asakura.」%K%P

0x608
Makoto「What the hell are you saying? You're the Iida...」%K%P

0x61C
Okuhiko instantly shuts me up with a dirty glare...%K%P

0x630
Okuhiko「Right, right, I'm the Iida Lumber Store's part-time clerk,%NOkuhiko Asakura.」%K%P

0x63C
The girl watches our little exchange with curiosity...%K%P

0x658
??「Ah... Hello...」%K%P

0x664
... And mutters this, a little overwhelmed.%K%P

0x678
Okuhiko「So, where's the pizza?」%K%P

0x684
??「R-Right...」%K%P

0x6A0
Slightly flustered, the girl pulls a thin box out of the%Nsilver bag.%K%P

0x6B4
??「Here is your order!」%K%P

0x6C0
Okuhiko reverently accepts the box before asking her...%K%P

0x6D4
Okuhiko「How much is it?」%K%P

0x6E8
??「1200 yen.」%K%P

0x6F4
Okuhiko takes some money out of his pocket, and gives%Nit to the girl.%K%P

0x700
After she takes it...%K%P

0x714
??「Thank you very much♪」%K%P

0x728
... she gives a deep bow before energetically running off.%K%P

0x73C
Okuhiko gives a smug smile as he sees off the girl's%Nretreating figure.%K%P

0x748
I see, so that's how it is...%K%P

0x754
I'm finally beginning to understand Okuhiko's ulterior%Nmotive for coming here.%K%P

0x7D8
Yuka「Hold on, hold on. Just what is going on here?」%K%P

0x7E4
Well, I can't blame Yuka for getting sulky.%K%P

0x7F0
The slightly cold seafood pizza has been placed on top%Nof the glass table in front of the sofa.%K%P

0x804
Yuka「Okuhiko-kun... wasn't your stomach not feeling very%Ngood?」%K%P

0x820
Okuhiko「Yeah, but somehow... *munch munch*... before I knew it...%N*munch munch*... it looks like it got better.」%K%P

0x834
As he says this, Okuhiko reaches out for another slice%Nof pizza.%K%P

0x840
Yuka「Haruka... didn't you say that you weren't hungry earlier?」%K%P

0x85C
Haruka「Yes, earlier.」%K%P

0x868
She monotonously declares this with an unwavering%Nexpression.%K%P

0x874
She nibbles at a slice of pizza with her small mouth.%K%P

0x880
Yuka「What do you mean, 'earlier'...?」%K

0xB50
I'll back up Haruka.

0xB5C
I'll back up Yuka.

0x8C8
Makoto「She means she's hungry now, but wasn't earlier.」%K%P

0x8D4
Haruka gives a small nod in agreement.%K%P

0x8E8
Yuka「Geez―」%K%P

0x8F4
Defeated, Yuka sullenly drops down onto the sofa.%K%P

0x910
Makoto「Haruka... you're being rude to Yuka.」%K%P

0x91C
Yuka nods in agreement.%K%P

0x928
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x934
Haruka seemingly ignores me as she reaches out for%Nanother slice of pizza.%K%P

0x948
Yuka「Geez... Well, I'm over it now...」%K%P

0x954
With a defeated look, Yuka drops down onto the sofa.%K%P

0x968
I find that I can't really stay mad at Haruka, who is calmly,%Nyet intently, eating her food.%K%P

0x974
She's just like any other honest, simple girl. At least,%Nthat's how I see it.%K%P

0x980
My frustration dies down as I observe the placid girl.%K%P

0x98C
Before I know it, all signs of irritation are washed away.%K%P
