In the end, I couldn't get any sleep after that.%K%P

0x8C
Staying in my room became unbearable, so I headed%Nover to Lunabeach to wait for it to open.%K%P

0x98
At any rate, I want to see Izumi-san's smile as soon as%Npossible.%K%P

0xA4
I stand in front of the shop, and bolt open the door.%K%P

0x100
Izumi「Oh... Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x10C
Izumi-san is here, as expected.%K%N

0x118
A smile rises to her face.%K%P

0x124
But...%K%N

0x130
... It's not her usual kind smile.%K%P

0x13C
It's an unnatural, forced smile.%K%P

0x150
Izumi「Why are you here so early?」%K%P

0x15C
Makoto「No... umm...」%K%P

0x168
I hesitate.%K%P

0x174
Should I just tell her the truth?%K%P

0x180
After all, I told Izumi-san about my dream during the Test%Nof Courage.%K%P

0x18C
But to say "Izumi-san was the one in my dream", or...%K%P

0x198
"Izumi-san, you might die tomorrow."%K%P

0x1A4
―There's no way I can say that!%K%P

0x1B8
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x1C4
Izumi-san stares at me with an uneasy expression.%K%P

0x1D0
I hang my head down to avoid her glance.%K%P

0x1E4
Izumi「Well, you've come all this way, so have a seat.」%K%P

0x1F0
Izumi「As you can see, there's no customers here...」%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x210
Izumi「Oh, rather than 'as you can see', maybe it would be%Nbetter for me to say 'as usual'?」%K%P

0x21C
Izumi-san says this as she runs her right hand through%Nher hair.%K%P

0x254
Upon Izumi-san's urging, I sit down on a chair on the%Nterrace.%K%P

0x260
She brings two cups of tea, and sits down in the seat%Nopposite of me.%K%P

0x26C
The sky that I can see over her shoulder is thick with%Nclouds.%K%P

0x280
Izumi「Makoto-kun...?」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x298
Izumi「Have you had breakfast yet?」%K%P

0x2A4
Izumi「If not, would you like me to make some?」%K%P

0x2B0
I silently shake my head.%K%P

0x2BC
In this situation, I don't think I'd be able to swallow%Nanything.%K%P

0x2D0
Izumi「Then... I know, how about a game of cards?」%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「... Cards?」%K%P

0x2F0
Without responding to me, Izumi-san stands up and%Nheads for the counter.%K%P

0x2FC
Before long...%K%P

0x310
Izumi「One of the customers yesterday forgot them.」%K%P

0x31C
... Izumi-san returns holding a deck of cards while%Nspeaking in a strange, shrill voice.%K%P

0x330
Izumi「What shall we play?」%K%P

0x33C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x348
Izumi「How about President?」%K%P

0x354
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x360
Izumi「Or how about Old Maid?」%K%P

0x374
Izumi「Oh... but there's only two of us, so it probably won't be%Nany fun.」%K%P

0x380
Izumi-san continues to smile.%K%P

0x38C
However, when I look at that smile, I feel a dull pain in my%Nheart.%K%P

0x398
(Would it be better if I told her... after all...?)%K%P

0x3A4
(Tell her everything that I saw...)%K%P

0x3B0
(If I don't... then will the worst possible outcome occur...?)%K%P

0x3D4
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x3E0
Izumi-san gently places the cards on the table.%K%P

0x3EC
Izumi「I shouldn't have told you after all...」%K%P

0x3F8
Makoto「Huh...?」%K%P

0x40C
Izumi「What I said yesterday...」%K%P

0x418
Izumi「If I knew things would have gotten this awkward, I wouldn't%Nhave said it...」%K%P

0x424
Izumi「I'm sorry, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x430
Makoto「No, don't...」%K%P

0x43C
Izumi「It was always like this in the past...」%K%P

0x448
Izumi「I never thought that I'd be a bother to the ones I like...%Nand I couldn't stop myself... from falling in love with them,%Nno matter what...」%K%P

0x454
Makoto「Izumi-san... you're wrong...」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「You're not being a both-」%K%P

0x46C
Izumi「It's fine... really...」%K%P

0x478
Izumi「It's really all right...」%K%P

0x484
Izumi「In the first place, I didn't have those qualifications to%Nstart with.」%K%P

0x490
Qualifications...?%K%P

0x49C
Izumi「I don't have the qualifications to fall in love... with you.」%K%P

0x4A8
Makoto「What qualifications...?」%K%P

0x4B4
Izumi「... I'm so sorry.」%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x4CC
Izumi「I'm really... sorry...」%K%P

0x4E0
With that, Izumi-san shuts her mouth.%K%P

0x4EC
She casts her eyes downwards, tracing her finger along%Nthe edges of the cards.%K%P

0x4F8
I...%K%N

0x520
I don't know what I should do.%K%P

0x52C
Izumi-san's feelings have reached my heart.%K%P

0x538
But before I can answer those feelings, there's%Nsomething I have to think about first.%K%P

0x544
Right now, I don't have the time to consider anything else.%K%P

0x550
(―I shouldn't tell her about that after all!)%K%P

0x55C
That's what my instincts are telling me.%K%P

0x568
I don't know whether Izumi-san believes what I said about%Nmy premonitions or not, but at any rate, if I were to tell%Nher about the "dream", she'd surely freak out.%K%P

0x574
Last night, under the starry sky, Izumi-san said this.%K%P

0x580
"Regulus is continuing to shine even now,"...%K%P

0x58C
I don't want to make Izumi-san any sadder.%K%P

0x598
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x5A4
Makoto「Shall we... play cards?」%K%P

0x5B8
Izumi-san slowly raises her head.%K%P

0x5C4
Her eyes are brimming with tears.%K%P

0x5D0
Makoto「Well? Shall we play?」%K%P

0x5E4
Izumi-san gives me a small nod.%K%P

0x5F8
When she does that, tears fall from her eyes.%K%P

0x604
They crash onto the table...%K%P

0x610
As Izumi-san's shoulders tremble, she keeps wiping%Naway the traces of her tears with her palm over and%Nover again.%K%P

0x61C
But no matter how many times she does it, new tears just%Nreplace the old ones...%K%P

0x628
(Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x634
(I will protect her!)%K%P

0x640
(No matter what, I will definitely protect her until the end!)%K%P

0x64C
(I won't... believe in premonitions anymore!)%K%P

0x658
(That way, Izumi-san will have nothing to worry about!!)%K%P

0x664
Yes... I remember it clearly.%K%P

0x670
Izumi-san's words on the night of the Test of Courage...%K%P

0x67C
"It's all right... because you have nothing to worry about,%NMakoto-kun..."%K%P

0x688
I will never forget the kindness and warmth she%Nenveloped me in back then.%K%P

0x694
When I came here, I was finally able to realize it.%K%P

0x6A0
Izumi-san is a person who, to me, cannot be replaced, an%Nimportant existence...%K%P

0x6E8
... ... ...%K%P
