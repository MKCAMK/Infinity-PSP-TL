Suddenly... I wake up.%K%P

0x160
It's not that I had a nightmare, or heard a loud sound.%K%P

0x16C
I just somehow woke up for no reason...%K%P

0x178
I take a look at my watch, which I'd placed on my bedside.%K%P

0x184
"1:10 A.M."... It's probably only been about three hours%Nsince I went to bed.%K%P

0x190
My mind is surprisingly wide awake, so I try to do%Nmultiplication tables in my mind to help me go back to%Nsleep.%K%P

0x19C
I try this countless times...%K%P

0x1A8
It's no use- I'm too alert.%K%P

0x1B4
Resigning myself, I slip out of bed and head out to the%Nliving room...%K%P

0x214
Of course, there's no one in the living room.%K%P

0x220
I let out a sigh in the quiet, empty room.%K%P

0x22C
I can hear Okuhiko snoring from up in the loft.%K%P

0x238
Then, all of the sudden...%K%P

0x244
Okuhiko「Hey! Wait!」%K%P

0x250
... Okuhiko suddenly shouts in a roaring voice.%K%N

0x25C
When I look up in surprise...%K%P

0x2D8
Okuhiko「This is bad... I... don't have... enough... energy...... Zzz...」%K%P

0x2EC
Okuhiko「Neutrino Energy, Power On! ... Trans～form! ... There! ...%NZzz...」%K%P

0x300
Okuhiko「You've shown yourself, Mysterious Hi-Tech Vacuum%NCleaner Man... Ugh... He's... sucking... me in... ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x314
Okuhiko「Good work... Zzz...」%K%P

0x328
Okuhiko「Hey! ... Kid! ... Get off of the stage! ... Hey, stop it! ... Don't...%Nlower... that zipper! ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x33C
... It seems he's just sleeptalking.%K%P

0x348
(Whew... man, what kind of dream is he having anyway...?)%K%P

0x354
I ignore Okuhiko, and casually decide to try going%Noutside the lodge...%K%P

0x3A4
From an opening in the forest, I can vaguely see that the%Nlights in Saki's summer house are on.%K%P

0x3B0
(That's right... there's something I've got to ask Saki!)%K%P

0x3BC
I determinedly head towards the summer house.%K%P

0x414
In any case, there's just too many things about Saki%Nthat are bothering me.%K%P

0x420
The bell... Haruka...%K%P

0x42C
I'll make sure I get the full story this time.%K%P

0x438
I'm unusually confident right now.%K%P

0x444
When I arrive at the summer house, I start to reach for%Nthe buzzer.%K%P

0x450
At that time...%K%P

0x478
(Hmm...?)%K%P

0x484
I feel like I can hear Saki's voice.%K%P

0x490
I try to strain my ears.%K%P

0x4B8
Saki「Wait. Didn't I tell you to wait?」%K%P

0x508
I was right.%K%P

0x514
I walk towards the direction of the voice.%K%P

0x520
I circle halfway around the wide grounds, and arrive at%Nthe backyard.%K%P

0x52C
There's light coming from the area around the back door.%K%P

0x538
Saki's lively voice grows louder as I get closer.%K%P

0x544
I can also hear some kind of high-pitched bark...%K%P

0x56C
I stop and stare.%K%P

0x580
Saki's there.%K%P

0x58C
She's wearing a pair of glasses, and is holding, in her%Narms, a playful puppy by her feet.%K%P

0x598
It seems to be a stray puppy.%K%P

0x5A4
It's the source of that bark I heard just now...%K%P

0x5B0
Saki「You worried me! Where did you go?」%K%P

0x5D8
The puppy she's holding happily licks her cheek.%K%P

0x5E4
She lets out a ticklish laugh.%K%P

0x5F0
I'm surprised to see Saki so different from her usual self.%K%P

0x5FC
Of course, I'm not talking about her glasses.%K%P

0x608
I'm talking about how gentle, peaceful, and content she%Nlooks.%K%P

0x614
Saki「Okay, wait there for a little bit.」%K%P

0x63C
Saki puts the puppy down, and disappears into the%Nhouse.%K%P

0x648
The dog wags its tail back and forth and starts barking%Nin its high-pitched voice.%K%P

0x654
I approach the back door.%K%P

0x660
The puppy almost notices me, so I head for cover.%K%P

0x66C
Saki comes out.%K%P

0x678
She's holding a plastic container with something inside.%K%P

0x684
The puppy vigorously wags its tail as it barks in%Nanticipation.%K%P

0x6AC
Saki「Shh. You won't get a treat if you're naughty.」%K%P

0x6B8
Saki scolds the puppy a bit before opening the plastic%Ncontainer.%K%P

0x6C4
Inside are leftovers of a splendid meat dish.%K%P

0x6D0
Saki crouches down, and presents the plastic container%Nto the puppy.%K%P

0x6DC
It excitedly chews on the meat.%K%P

0x6E8
―I see!%K%P

0x6F4
I recall the quarrel at the barbecue.%K%P

0x700
The beef she took back then... she actually planned to%Nsplit it with this puppy...%K%P

0x70C
It seems that she felt very uneasy about stealing the%Nbeef from us, but at that point, she'd gone too far to%Nretreat...%K%P

0x718
Saki「Don't eat so quickly... or you'll choke.」%K%P

0x724
Saki gently pets the puppy on its back, her face%Nbrimming with affection.%K%P

0x730
Even though she's nothing but extremely aggressive%Nand foul-mouthed towards the rest of us...%K%P

0x73C
(She really is a kind girl deep down, isn't she...?)%K%P

0x748
I quietly leave so that Saki doesn't notice me.%K%P

0x754
My thoughts of questioning Saki have completely%Ndisappeared.%K%P

0x760
It seems like I'll be going to sleep in a good mood...%K%P

0x7B0
That feel-good state lingers as I go to bed, and allows%Nme to quickly fall asleep...%K%P

0x804
But that slumber is brief.%K%P

0x858
(It's so noisy... Who is it? Just when I finally got into a%Ngood mood...)%K%P

0x864
Just before I can fall deeply asleep, that sound%Ndisturbs it.%K%P

0x870
It's the sound of tapping on the window...%K%P

0x87C
The small window on the wide ceiling... someone's tapping%Nit...%K%P

0x888
Irritated, I stand on top of my bed.%K%P

0x894
I stand on my tiptoes and open the ceiling window.%K%P

0x8A0
Pulling up with both of my arms, I raise the upper half of%Nmy body outside the window...%K%P

0x8AC
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x8D4
It's Saki.%K%P

0x8E0
Saki tapped the window with a long tree branch.%K%P

0x8EC
When Saki notices me, she averts her face as she%Nbecomes flustered, and talks rapidly.%K%P

0x8F8
Saki「I'm just in the middle of a walk.」%K%P

0x904
Makoto「Come again?」%K%P

0x910
Saki「It's not like I came here to see you.」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「Uh... what?」%K%P

0x928
Saki「In other words, it's all just a coincidence.」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Right...」%K%P

0x940
Saki「It's just that... while I'm here... thank you for this morning.」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x958
Saki「For the basket!」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「'While I'm here'...」%K%P

0x970
Saki「Well then, that means I've thanked you.」%K

0x18D8
"Wait."

0x18E4
"Y-Yeah..."

0x9B8
Makoto「Wait.」%K%P

0x9C4
Saki「Good night.」%K%P

0x9D0
Makoto「Hey, I said wait!」%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「Will you wait right there? Okay? Stay right there! Don't run%Noff!」%K%P

0x9E8
Without waiting for Saki to reply, I shut the window, and%Nget off the bed.%K%P

0xA20
I quickly change my clothes and sneak outside.%K%P

0xA2C
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0xA38
I abruptly shout in alarm. Where is she?%K%P

0xA44
Saki「I'm right here!」%K%P

0xA50
Makoto「Oh, good. You surprised me.」%K%P

0xA64
Saki「I'm the one who's surprised. Yelling like that... So, what is%Nit?」%K%P

0xA70
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xA7C
Saki「Your business. What's your business with me?」%K%P

0xA88
Makoto「I don't have any, but...」%K%P

0xA94
Saki「Then I'm going home.」%K%P

0xAA0
Makoto「Hey, hey, I don't have to have business with you, do I?%NYou've come all this way, after all...」%K%P

0xAAC
Saki「Didn't I just tell you that coming here in the middle of my%Nwalk was a complete coincidence?」%K%P

0xAB8
Makoto「Why... in the middle of the night?」%K%P

0xAC4
Saki「It doesn't matter, does it?」%K%P

0xAD0
Makoto「If it's doesn't matter, then come here.」%K%P

0xADC
Saki「No way. The stars will move.」%K%P

0xAF0
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0xAFC
Saki「Well then, good night.」%K%P

0xB08
Makoto「... Good night.」%K%P

0xB14
Saki quickly goes down the lodge's staircase and%Nleaves.%K%P

0xB20
I shut the window, and crawl into my bed again.%K%P

0xB2C
Even though it was only for a short time, having the%Nwindow open has caused the room to get freezing cold.%K%P

0xB38
I pull the covers over my head to try to preserve my%Nescaping body temperature.%K%P

0xB44
And then, I think of Saki...%K%P

0xB50
The Saki who isn't honest towards other people.%K%P

0xB5C
The Saki who doesn't show any weakness to other%Npeople.%K%P

0xB68
The Saki who is prouder than others.%K%P

0xB74
But I'm the only one who knows.%K%P

0xB80
I know the fact that Saki is a nice girl better than anyone%Nelse...%K%P

0xB8C
... She's simply a little bad at expressing her feelings.%K%P

0xB98
What she did just now was the best she could do to%Nexpress her thanks.%K%P

0xBA4
While thinking about that, I feel that it's kinda lonely for%NSaki just to go home like that.%K%P

0xBB0
(Saki...)%K%P

0xBBC
Unable to keep my emotions in check, I push aside the%Ncovers.%K%P

0xBC8
(I might have enough time to make it...)%K%P

0xC00
I quickly change my clothes and sneak outside.%K%P

0xC0C
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0xC18
There's no way she's here... Even so, I can't help but yell.%K%P

0xC24
Saki「I'm right here!」%K%P

0xC30
Makoto「Huh...!?」%K%P

0xC44
Makoto「What's this, you're still here... You surprised me.」%K%P

0xC50
Saki「I'm the one who's surprised. Yelling like that... So, what is%Nit?」%K%P

0xC5C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xC68
Saki「Your business. What's your business with me?」%K%P

0xC74
Makoto「I don't have any, but...」%K%P

0xC80
Saki「Then I'm going back.」%K%P

0xC8C
Makoto「Hey, hold on!」%K%P

0xC98
Saki「You don't have any business with me, right?」%K%P

0xCA4
Makoto「Nope.」%K%P

0xCB0
Saki「Then it's fine, isn't it?」%K%P

0xCBC
Makoto「... Well, do YOU have any business after this, Saki?」%K%P

0xCC8
Saki「Nope.」%K%P

0xCD4
Makoto「If that's the case... since you've come all this way, you%Nought to rest for a while.」%K%P

0xCE0
Saki「Didn't I just tell you that coming here in the middle of my%Nwalk was a complete coincidence?」%K%P

0xCEC
Makoto「Why... in the middle of the night?」%K%P

0xCF8
Saki「It doesn't matter, does it?」%K%P

0xD04
Makoto「If it's doesn't matter, then come here.」%K%P

0xD10
Saki「No way. The stars will move.」%K%P

0xD40
Makoto「Stars?」%K%P

0xD54
I suddenly look up.%K%P

0xD60
I'm taken aback as my heart is awestruck.%K%P

0xD6C
The cloudless night sky is adorned with bright stars.%K%P

0xD78
I didn't notice them at all...%K%P

0xDA0
Saki「The stars around here are at the height of their beauty%Naround this season.」%K%P

0xDAC
Makoto「So you like stars, Saki?」%K%P

0xDB8
Saki「Not particularly.」%K%P

0xDC4
Makoto「I get it... You definitely like them, right?」%K%P

0xDD0
Saki「...」%K%P

0xDE4
I remember what happened when I went to the summer%Nhouse earlier.%K%P

0xDF0
I feel that the sight of Saki looking at the stars really%Nsuits her, just as the sight of her being affectionate to%Nthat puppy was...%K%P

0xDFC
Saki hangs her head down, and walks quickly.%K%P

0xE08
Makoto「Where are you going?」%K%P

0xE14
Saki「Over there.」%K%P

0xE20
She starts walking towards the forest path.%K%P

0xE2C
Makoto「Then I'll go too.」%K%P

0xE38
Saki「Don't get close to me.」%K%P

0xE44
Makoto「Understood, mistress...」%K%P

0xE50
For some reason, I'm not angry.%K%P

0xE5C
A strange emotion stirs inside of me as I follow her.%K%P

0xEAC
I don't know how far she plans on going, but Saki steadily%Ndescends the forest path's hill road.%K%P

0xEB8
I follow her as I leisurely look up at the stars.%K%P

0xEC4
I don't know the names of the constellations, but looking%Nat them like this feels strangely romantic.%K%P

0xED0
(I remember that there were times where I would%Ninnocently look at the stars when I was a kid...)%K%P

0xEDC
At that time, I didn't think that there was a world where%Nyou thought about girls in terms of "like or dislike".%K%P

0xEE8
It's a very nostalgic time, but...%K%P

0xEF4
... The current me...%K%P

0xF08
Saki「Makoto-kun, why are you walking so slowly?」%K%P

0xF14
Makoto「Hey, Saki? Could you come here for a second?」%K%P

0xF20
Saki「Why?」%K%P

0xF2C
Makoto「You'll see.」%K%P

0xF38
... The current me already knows that world exists.%K%P

0xF44
I can't return to who I was. I've already learned too many%Nthings, both good and bad.%K%P

0xF58
Saki「What?」%K%P

0xF64
Saki asks this as she tilts her head.%K%P

0xF70
I...%K

0x18F0
Lie down and stretch

0x18FC
Push Saki down as she walks.

0xFDC
I lie down face-up and stretch.%K%P

0xFE8
Saki「What... are you doing?」%K%P

0xFF4
Saki looks at me with a suspicious expression.%K%P

0x1000
Makoto「I've never seen anything so beautiful before.」%K%P

0x100C
Saki「... Wha-!? What's this... all of the sudden...」%K%P

0x1018
Makoto「These stars.」%K%P

0x1024
Saki「Huh...?」%K%P

0x1030
Saki follows my gaze until she sees that I'm looking at the%Nstars.%K%P

0x103C
Saki「Y... Yeah, you're right...」%K%P

0x1048
Makoto「Why are you flustered?」%K%P

0x1054
Saki「I-I'm not flustered, dammit!」%K%P

0x1060
I grin at Saki's agitation and look up at the stars again.%K%P

0x106C
Makoto「Come on, you should try it.」%K%P

0x1078
Saki「Huh...?」%K%P

0x1084
Makoto「Lie down like this and gaze at the stars. It feels great.」%K%P

0x1090
I stretch my body out under this starry sky. It really%Ndoes feel great.%K%P

0x109C
Makoto「Well? Why don't you give it a try?」%K%P

0x10A8
Saki firmly stares at me.%K%P

0x10B4
Saki「... Only a commoner would find this entertaining.」%K%P

0x10C0
Makoto「That's right. That's why I'm doing it, right?」%K%P

0x10CC
Saki「And you're childish, too.」%K%P

0x10D8
Makoto「That's because I did this a lot when I was a kid.」%K%P

0x10E4
Just then, Saki's face suddenly softens.%K%P

0x10F0
Saki「If you wanted me to lay by your side so badly, you only%Nhad to ask...」%K%P

0x10FC
As she says this, she slowly sits on the ground.%K%P

0x1108
She shyly lays back, her body sprawled on the grass.%K%P

0x1368
When I get close enough to Saki, I suddenly push her%Ndown as she walks.%K%P

0x1374
Saki「!!!」%K%P

0x1380
I collapse onto the forest path along with with Saki. When%Nshe tries to get back up, I push her down from the side.%K%P

0x138C
Saki「Wh-What the hell are you doing!? No!」%K%P

0x1398
Makoto「Don't make a fuss. Just stay like this.」%K%P

0x13A4
As I hold down the struggling Saki with my arm, I point to%Nthe sky.%K%P

0x13E0
Saki「...?」%K%P

0x13EC
Saki suddenly looks up at the starry sky.%K%P

0x13F8
Makoto「When I was a kid, I did this a lot.」%K%P

0x1404
Makoto「When the stars were beautiful, I would watch them like this.」%K%P

0x1410
Saki「...」%K%P

0x141C
I take my hand off of Saki.%K%P

0x1428
She's still stiffly curled up near me.%K%P

0x1434
Makoto「Why don't you give it a try...?」%K%P

0x1440
Saki「...」%K%P

0x144C
Saki「... If you wanted me to lay by your side so badly, you%Nonly had to ask...」%K%P

0x1458
She shyly lays back, her body sprawled on the grass.%K%P

0x146C
Saki「This isn't bad... it's like a natural planetarium.」%K%P

0x1478
(Oh brother...)%K%P

0x1484
(Such a stubborn rich girl...)%K%P

0x1490
I look towards Saki with a bitter smile.%K%P

0x149C
Saki is stargazing with a rather content expression...%K%P

0x14A8
She doesn't pay any attention to me, staring dazedly at%Nthe stars.%K%P

0x14B4
The dark blue starry sky shines in Saki's large eyes.%K%P

0x14C0
Her pale cheeks get wet with the evening dew.%K%P

0x14CC
She instinctively touches it with her fingertip, and flicks%Nit off her skin.%K%P

0x14D8
She sighs, and her soft hair becomes loose.%K%P

0x14E4
Her unraveled hair is beautiful, befitting of a%Nfascinatingly elegant woman.%K%P

0x14F0
The night wears on by.%K%P

0x14FC
Saki and I continue to lie on the ground while being%Nbathed by the stars' radiance...%K%P

0x1508
... ... ...%K%P

0x152C
―If this were a movie, then things would have ended%Nperfectly, but...%K%N

0x1538
... Reality is something that doesn't often go that well.%K%P

0x1570
Saki「How do you plan on taking responsibility for this?」%K%P

0x157C
Makoto「'Responsibility'? It's just a little mud. It's not something to%Nworry about, is it?」%K%P

0x1590
Saki「You might be fine with it, but I sure as hell am not.%NAb-so-lute-ly not!」%K%P

0x159C
It seems this rich girl is quite the neat freak.%K%P

0x15A8
When we got up to head back, we found that we had%Ngotten mud on our clothes, causing Saki to start a hissy%Nfit...%K%P

0x15B4
Makoto「Understood, mistress. I shall clean it off as you desire...」%K%P

0x15C0
I begin to write on the mud using the back of my hand.%K%P

0x15D4
Saki「Could you not be so irresponsible?」%K%P

0x15E0
Makoto「Huh? What am I, your slave...?」%K%P

0x15EC
Saki「Swear that you definitely won't get mud on me.」%K%P

0x15F8
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x1604
Saki「Swear it.」%K%P

0x1610
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x161C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1628
(Damn it, why do I have to do something like this...?)%K%P

0x1634
Although I grumble in my mind, I reluctantly make the oath.%K%P

0x1640
Makoto「I. DEFINITELY. WON'T. GET. MUD. ON. YOU. SAKI.」%K%P

0x164C
Saki「Henceforth, you will not forgive any living creature who%Ngets mud on me, with no exceptions. All right now, swear it.」%K%P

0x1658
Makoto「Huh? ... So if that means if something gets mud on you, I%Nhave to exact revenge on it no matter what?」%K%P

0x1664
Saki「Are you complaining? As a commoner, you should be%Nkneeling before me!」%K%P

0x1678
(Oh brother... she has quite the nerve...)%K%P

0x1684
(She really is a rich girl...)%K%P

0x1690
Even so, Saki... seems to be having a lot of fun...%K%P

0x169C
While looking at her face... I'm starting to figure that this%Nisn't so bad.%K%P

0x16A8
Saki really is a kind person.%K%P

0x16B4
She's just unable to express that very well.%K%P

0x16C0
Right now, I realize I'm the only one to have seen the%Nessence of Saki's true character.%K%P

0x16CC
I think at the very least, I can listen to what she has to%Nsay, right?%K%P
