(Maybe I should even try going for a walk.)%K%P

How Kurumi left with the basket after saying she'd fix it...%K%P

0x1AC
However, she probably hasn't finished yet.%K%P

0x1B8
That basket is vital to my plan...%K%P

0x1C4
(Should I wait for Kurumi to fix it?)%K%P

0x1D0
(... Or should I go see Saki?)%K%P

0x1DC
While thinking about this, I swing the door open with all my%Nmight to get some fresh air.%K%P

0x214
Kurumi「Kyaa!」%K%P

0x248
Kurumi is in front of me.%K%P

0x254
Because I pulled the door inward, Kurumi loses her%Nbalance and stumbles into the room.%K%P

0x260
As she tries to stop herself from falling, she%Ndesperately tries to protect the basket in her hands...%K%P

0x284

0x2B0
She thrusts the basket into my chest.%K%P

0x2BC
I take the basket and examine it.%K%P

0x2C8

0x354
Kurumi's legs are trembling... She might not have gotten%Nmuch sleep.%K%P

0x368
I take another look at the basket.%K%P

0x374
There is a small charm tied to the side.%K%P

0x380
It wasn't there yesterday.%K%P

0x38C
(Must have been Kurumi who put it on...)%K%P

0x398
I inspect it further. It's just an ordinary charm.%K%P

0x3A4
Ring, ring... There's a small bell attached to it that rings%Nevery time it sways...%K%P

0x3B0
... I place the fixed basket on top of my bed, and decide%Nto go with Kurumi to the living room for now.%K%P
