After dinner, we all thank Izumi-san again for cooking.%K%P

0x60
Of course, her cooking was as good as always, but what%Nhappened between Haruka and Saki was still bothering%Nme.%K%P

0x6C
I think everyone else feels the same way.%K%P

0x78
Now that the meal's ended, we're stuck once again in an%Nunpleasant silence...%K%P

0xB8
Kurumi「Hey, Kurumi just got a good idea.」%K%P

0xCC
Okuhiko「What is it?」%K%P

0xD8
Kurumi「There's an old graveyard close by♪」%K%P

0xEC
Okuhiko「Huh?」%K%P

0x100
Kurumi「How about having a Test of Courage there!!?」%K%P

0x10C
As I thought, Kurumi too probably couldn't stand the%Nawkward atmosphere any longer.%K%N

0x118
This is probably her way of taking us into consideration.%K%P

0x12C
Kurumi「Are you listening, Onii-chan!? Doesn't it sound fun!?」%K%P

0x138
Makoto「Huh? Ah, sure, I don't mind.」%K%P

0x14C
Kurumi「Yay—! Then it's decided!」%K%P

0x168
Yuka「Huu—uuh!? Hold on!」%K%P

0x17C
Kurumi「Huh? Don't tell me you're scared, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x190
Yuka「I-It's not like that at all!」%K%P

0x1A4
Kurumi「Then it's settled!!」%K%P

0x1B0
In the end, it's decided that we'll go with Kurumi's plan and%Nhave a Test of Courage.%K%P

0x244
However, the whole Saki issue is still bugging me.%K%N

0x250
Is it really impossible to convince Saki to come along%Nwith us?%K%P

0x25C
I start to toy with the idea, but after considering how%Nstubborn she is, I wonder whether or not just to forget%Nabout it.%K%N

0x268
It'll probably be better to just leave her alone for a while%Nso she can cool her head off.%K%P

0x274
Well then, what should I do?%K

0x460
Go to the Test of Courage with everyone.

0x46C
I'm worried about Saki after all.

0x2B4
Well, it'd probably be safer not to concern myself with%Nher for now.%K%P

0x2C0
Content with my decision, I follow Kurumi and the others.%K%P

0x2E8
Makoto「I'll pass. I'm worried about Saki.」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「I feel kinda bad for her...」%K%P

0x308
Kurumi「What!? Onii-chan, you're just scared, right?」%K%P

0x314
Makoto「Yeah, maybe.」%K%P

0x320
I head for Saki's summer house once again, leaving%Nbehind a sulky Kurumi.%K%P
