??「... Are you awake?」%K%P

0x170
Late at night, I hear a quiet knock on the door, along with%Na clear voice I've now become accustomed to.%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「Yeah. It's open, so come on in.」%K%P

0x188
??「... All right.」%K%P

0x1B0
Of course, the one who comes into the dim room is Haruka.%K%P

0x1F8
Haruka「I'm sorry, were you asleep?」%K%P

0x204
Makoto「No, I couldn't sleep for some reason... But more%Nimportantly, what about you? Is something up?」%K%P

0x210
Haruka「I couldn't sleep either... So I wanted to ask you a favor,%Nbut...」%K%P

0x21C
I see... I remember that on the last 5th, this was the time%Nwhen Haruka invited me to go see the shiranui with her...%K%P

0x240
Haruka「U-Umm... I couldn't sleep last night either. So, when I took a%Nwalk outside by myself... I saw some shiranui. I think it was%Nabout 4:30 in the morning...」%K%P

0x24C
Makoto「So you thought you'd go to see them again, and came%Nhere to invite me?」%K%P

0x258
I instantly ask this.%K%P

0x26C
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0x278
Makoto「Got it. Then let's go... see the shiranui.」%K%P

0x284
Makoto「But it's only 1:00. That's too early, isn't it? I think it'd be%Nbest if we got some more sleep, even if it's only for a%Nlittle bit.」%K%P

0x290
Makoto「Because I'm sure tomorrow will also get busy... I can lend%Nyou my watch if you'd like.」%K%P

0x29C
Haruka「No, I'll be fine. Well then, I'll let you sleep for a bit, then%Ncome to wake you up afterwards.」%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「Yeah. I'll leave the door unlocked so that you can wake%Nme up if I'm still asleep.」%K%P

0x2B4
Haruka「All right, I understand. It's a promise.」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「... It's a promise.」%K%P

0x30C
When she hears those words, a satisfied smile rises to%NHaruka's face, and she leaves the room.%K%P

0x318
4:30, huh... I set my watch alarm to that time.%K%P

0x324
I'm sure that on that day of the "incident", the last thing I%Nheard before I lost consciousness was my watch alarm...%K%P

0x330
So in other words, that means... on the previous 6th...%NHaruka died shortly before 4:30 A.M.%K%P

0x33C
Will I really... get through this somehow...?%K%P

0x3AC
My watch alarm...%K%N

0x3B8
And, at the same time...%K%P

0x3E0
Haruka「Makoto... are you awake?」%K%P

0x3F4
... Haruka's quiet, restrained voice comes in from outside%Nthe door.%K%P

0x424
Haruka「I'm sorry... for making such an unreasonable request.」%K%P

0x430
Makoto「... What are you talking about? I wanted to be with you, so%Nit's fine.」%K%P

0x444
Haruka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x450
I get a little embarrassed by what I said.%K%P

0x45C
As if to hide that embarrassment, I take Haruka's arm and%Nleave the lodge.%K%P

0x4E4
Haruka and I begin to walk side-by-side down the hill%Nroad that leads to the shoreline.%K%P

0x4F0
... Just then, Haruka suddenly mutters this.%K%P

0x504
Haruka「They're so pretty...」%K%P

0x510
Haruka smiles as she gazes at the night sky.%K%P

0x52C
When I also look up, I see a canopy of stars.%K%P

0x538
The stars shine brightly, as if their light is raining down%Non the very soil of this earth.%K%P

0x544
These stars are the one thing that don't change with the%Nmovement of time.%K%P

0x550
My own existence feels tiny compared to them. A%Npowerless existence that can't do anything...%K%P

0x55C
—Can I really protect Haruka...?%K%P

0x568
Suddenly, I shift my gaze towards her.%K%P

0x584
Haruka's face has a cool and clear beauty to it as she%Nlooks up at the stars.%K%P

0x590
It looks as if all the filthy things the world has burdened%Nher with are starting to be dispelled by the light of the%Nstars... that's what I think.%K%P

0x59C
(I can't lose her... I'll definitely change history!)%K%P

0x5A8
I repeat this over and over in my mind while looking at%NHaruka.%K%P

0x5F8
Before long, we arrive at the coastline.%K%N

0x60C
As Haruka faces the sea, she looks up longingly at the%Nshimmering stars.%K%P

0x618
Her face looks anxious, and it feels like she's trying to%Nforce herself to smile.%K%P

0x624
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x638
Haruka「Huh? Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「No, I was just fascinated by you...」%K%P

0x658
Haruka「... Idiot.」%K%P

0x66C
A slightly embarrassed expression rises to Haruka's%Nface, and she turns towards beyond the black ocean.%K%P

0x678
Haruka「Ah... the ocean...」%K%P

0x68C
With those words, I also look at the ocean.%K%P

0x698
Countless lights with tinges of red and yellow rise above%Nthe water's surface.%K%P

0x6A4
They approach us before bobbing away, flickering.%K%P

0x6B0
Haruka「How pretty...」%K%P

0x6BC
Makoto「They start to move as if they're guiding sailors on ships.%NNo one knows where they came from or for what reason%Nthey sway. That's why they call it shiranui, or 'unknown%Nfire'...」%K%P

0x6C8
Haruka「Yes... I know that story too...」%K%P

0x6D4
Of course I know it... After all, she had told me this before.%K%P

0x6E0
We stay silent for a short while as we are entranced by%Nthe beautiful lights swaying around.%K%P

0x6EC
There's this fantastical atmosphere around Haruka right%Nnow, possessing the kind of attractive power a master%Npainting holds.%K%P

0x6F8
I let myself relax a bit, as if allowing myself to be%Nabsorbed into this atmosphere...%K%P

0x704
Haruka「Nobody knows that.」%K%P

0x710
Haruka「It can't be learned about either...」%K%P

0x71C
Makoto「That's why... it's shiranui.」%K%P

0x728
Haruka「Yes. That's why... it's shiranui...」%K%P

0x734
Haruka「If you listen carefully, you can hear them.」%K%P

0x740
Makoto「The calling voices of the shiranui...?」%K%P

0x74C
Haruka「Yes...」%K%P

0x758
Haruka closes her eyes. I mimic Haruka and do the same.%K%P

0x790
But... unfortunately, I'm unable to hear the shiranui's%Nvoices.%K%P

0x79C
All I can hear is the sound of Haruka breathing. She's%Nstanding so close to me that we're practically nestled%Ntogether.%K%P

0x7A8
I gently entwine my arm with hers, allowing me to hear%NHaruka's faint heartbeat.%K%P

0x7B4
I will never let this beating stop...%K%P

0x7C0
I'm the only one... who can protect Haruka...%K%P

0x7DC
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x7E8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x7F4
Makoto「I will definitely protect you...」%K%P

0x800
Haruka「... Huh?」%K%P

0x80C
Haruka looks at me questioningly.%K%P

0x818
Despite her confusion, I want her to understand this.%K%P

0x824
Those words are the oath I've sworn to myself.%K%P

0x830
Makoto「No matter what happens, I will definitely hold on to you!」%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「I don't want to lose you again...」%K%P

0x848
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x854
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x860
Haruka「... Makoto...」%K%P

0x87C
Haruka「... I...」%K%P

0x890
...%K%P

0x89C
... I realize that Haruka is in my chest.%K%P

0x8A8
She's warm... Haruka's warmth flows into my body...%K%P

0x8B4
Haruka gently places her hand on my chest.%K%P

0x8DC
Haruka「I won't leave. I also love this world where you exist too%Nmuch...」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「... Haruka...」%K%P

0x8FC
When I look up to the sky, I suddenly see a beautiful%Nstream of light flash by.%K%P

0x908
(I will protect Haruka!)%K%P

0x914
I once again solemnly swear this to myself as I tightly%Nembrace her.%K%P

0x920
The shooting star seems to bless us as it shoots%Ndazzling lights that brighten up the darkness one by%None.%K%P

0x92C
We hold each other close underneath the stars until%Nnight comes to an end...%K%P
