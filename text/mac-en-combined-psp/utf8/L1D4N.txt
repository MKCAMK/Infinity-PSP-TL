Everyone quietly cleaned up, and carried the tools back%Nto Lunabeach.%K%P

0x228
The four of us split up with Izumi-san and Kurumi at%NLunabeach, and decided to return to the lodge.%K%P

0x234
Everyone was still very silent and gloomy, as if we were%Nat a funeral...%K%P

0x240
Somehow or other, we all wandered off into our%Nrespective bedrooms.%K%P

0x24C
Right now, I'm lying on my bed while blankly staring at the%Nwall.%K%P

0x2C0
I'm completely exhausted, both physically and mentally.%K%P

0x2CC
Against my will, I'm suddenly dragged into an intense%Ndrowsiness that's wrapping me up.%K%P

0x2D8
(That's right... I've got to ask her...)%K%P

0x2E4
(I've got to ask Yuka... about... the... bell...)%K%P

0x2F0
Despite my efforts, I lose consciousness in the blink of%Nan eye...%K%P

0x304
(Haruka and Saki― What exactly is their history?)%K%P

0x310
("Bell"... So was the "bell" Haruka mentioned the same as%Nthat one'?)%K%P

0x31C
I'm completely exhausted, both physically and mentally.%K%P

0x328
Despite my efforts, I lose consciousness in the blink of%Nan eye...%K%P

0x334
Haruka「Will you... will you always help me?」%K%P

0x340
Haruka「Will you protect me?」%K%P

0x34C
Just before I fall asleep... I feel like I can hear Haruka's%Nwhispering voice in my head...%K%P

0x360
(Saki and Haruka―What exactly is their history?)%K%P

0x36C
Haruka「You're lying! You're lying! Give it back! Give me back that%N'bell'!」%K%P

0x378
("Bell"... So was that "bell" Haruka mentioned the same as%Nthat one?)%K%P

0x384
I'm completely exhausted, both physically and mentally.%K%P

0x390
Though I don't want to, I find myself drifting off to sleep.%K%P

0x39C
(I've got to... ask Saki...)%K%P

0x3A8
(About the bell... about Haruka... I've got to... ask her... all%Nof... it...)%K%P

0x3B4
Despite my efforts, I lose consciousness in the blink of%Nan eye...%K%P

0x3C8
I'm completely exhausted, both physically and mentally.%K%P

0x3D4
Though I don't want to, I find myself drifting off to sleep.%K%P

0x3E0
Despite my efforts, I lose consciousness in the blink of%Nan eye...%K%P

0x478
―Suddenly, I hear the sound of something bursting%Nopen.%K%P

0x484
Surprised by the sound, I frantically jump off the bed to%Nmy feet.%K%P

0x490
When I look towards the door, I see...%K%P

0x4A4
... Izumi-san!?%K%P

0x4B0
Izumi「Kurumi's...」%K%P

0x4BC
Izumi「Kurumi's gone!」%K%P

0x530
Izumi-san gathers the four of us in the living room, and%Ntells us what had happened.%K%P

0x544
Izumi「After you all left, I put all the barbecue tools in the%Nstorehouse, and took a shower.」%K%P

0x550
Izumi「I got out of the shower at about 9:30... and then, when I%Nwent up to the second floor...」%K%P

0x55C
Yuka「Kurumi-chan was gone...」%K%P

0x568
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x574
Izumi「I tried searching by myself, trying all the places that%Ncame to mind...」%K%P

0x580
Izumi「Inside the shop, the area around Moon Beach, all of it...」%K%P

0x58C
Yuka「Do you know of any other places Kurumi-chan would go?」%K%P

0x598
Yuka「Or do you have any clues...?」%K%P

0x5AC
Izumi-san softly closes her eyes, and gently shakes%Nher head.%K%P

0x5B8
Any clues, huh...%K%P

0x5C4
I remember the sight of Kurumi crying in the shade of the%Nrocks at Princess Beach.%K%P

0x5D0
Something bad must have happened to her...%K%P

0x5DC
Yuka「Anyway, sitting still here won't get anything solved...」%K%P

0x5F0
As she says this, Yuka stands upright.%K%P

0x5FC
Yuka「... Why don't we all quickly split up and look for Kurumi?」%K%P

0x664
Yuka「All right? Makoto, why don't you try searching Princess%NBeach, Viewpoint Park, and the south side of the island?」%K%P

0x670
Makoto「All right.」%K%P

0x67C
Yuka「Haruka, check the harbor and the shopping district...%Nthen do a complete search of the east side!」%K%P

0x688
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0x694
Yuka「I'll try searching the area around Moon Beach one more%Ntime...」%K%P

0x6A0
Yuka「And Izumi-san, please return to Lunabeach.」%K%P

0x6AC
Izumi「What?」%K%P

0x6B8
Yuka「If Kurumi-chan returns and you're not there, then she'll%Nprobably become the hunter instead of the other way%Naround, so to speak.」%K%P

0x6C4
Makoto「I see.」%K%P

0x6E0
Izumi「But...」%K%P

0x6EC
Makoto「It's all right! Leave it to us; we'll find her for sure!」%K%P

0x6F8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x704
Makoto「And it's possible she might have already returned...」%K%P

0x710
Makoto「She might be there, cheerful and oblivious to what has%Nhappened.」%K%P

0x71C
Yuka「Please don't worry, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x728
Izumi「... I understand.」%K%P

0x73C
Nevertheless, the uneasiness doesn't fade from her%Nexpression.%K%P

0x748
Her gaze nervously shifts from left to right, looking all%Nover her surroundings. It's clear she hasn't calmed down.%K%P

0x75C
Okuhiko「Y-Yuka-chan... What about me...?」%K%P

0x778
Yuka「Check the hot springs... the tennis court... and the%Ngraveyard.」%K%P

0x784
Okuhiko「... Th-The graveyard!?」%K%P

0x798
Yuka「Well then, let's begin the search right away!」%K%P

0x7A4
Yuka「If you find her, return to Lunabeach immediately! Got it!?」%K%P

0x818
Yuka, Haruka, and Izumi-san split up at the T-junction at%Nthe foot of the hill.%K%P

0x834
In the corner of my mind, thoughts of Yuka and the bell%Nstill lurk.%K%P

0x840
But now isn't the time to be worrying about something like%Nthat.%K%P

0x84C
Finding Kurumi comes first.%K%P

0x858
I stand in the center of Princess Beach, and call Kurumi's%Nname.%K%P

0x86C
I decide to try getting Princess Beach out of the way%Nfirst.%K%P

0x878
Makoto「Hey! Kurumi!」%K%P

0x8A0
I shout out towards the darkness.%K%P

0x8C8
However, I get no response.%K%P

0x8D4
Only the sound of the waves breaking up on the shore%Nbreaks up the silence.%K%P

0x8E0
When I suddenly look down, I see the scattered remains%Nof the barbecue.%K%P

0x8EC
It looks so lonely that it's hard to believe that we were%Nmaking a huge ruckus here just hours ago.%K%P

0x8F8
Makoto「Kurumi...」%K%P

0x904
I let out a sigh.%K%P

0x910
I lightly kick away the fragments of charcoal lying at my%Nfeet... and leave Princess Beach.%K%P

0x974
(Just where... is Kurumi...?)%K%P

0x980
I look left and right as I run down the shoreline...%K%P

0xA00
The row of cherry blossom trees, shrouded in the%Ndarkness... I'd bet they'd look a lot better if it were%Ndaytime...%K%P

0xA14
I go through the cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0xA20
The cherry blossom petals illuminated by the moonlight%Nappear vaguely white as they float in the darkness.%K%P

0xA2C
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0xA38
I shout as I walk through the row of trees.%K%P

0xA44
But there's no signs that anyone's here either...%K%P

0xAC4
The jet-black sea blurs the moonlight shining on it.%K%P

0xAD0
The lighthouse's light makes a dull metallic sound as it%Nspins around.%K%P

0xADC
In the end, I couldn't find Kurumi...%K%P

0xAE8
I casually lean my elbows against the fence, and look to%Nthe north from the south.%K%P

0xAF4
At the edge of the north, I can see Moon Beach. There is%Na small light lit in Lunabeach's open terrace.%K%P

0xB00
Now that I think about it, I've seen this lighthouse from%NMoon Beach before...%K%P

0xB0C
I'm sure it was two nights ago.%K%P

0xB18
At that time, Izumi-san told us that if two people%Nconfessed under this lighthouse, their love would bear%Nfruit.%K%P

0xB24
And then she told us the story about the shrine%Nafterwards...%K%P

0xB30
...???%K%P

0xB3C
―The shrine!?%K%P

0xB48
That's right, she could be at the shrine!%K%P

0xB64
Last night, Kurumi recklessly took me to the shrine...%K%P

0xB78
Two nights ago, Kurumi invited everyone to go on a%N"Mystery Tour".%K%P

0xB84
Even though Izumi-san then got angry, Kurumi still had a%Nkind of unsatisfied expression on her face...%K%P

0xB90
I immediately start running towards the Shiki no Mori%NShrine...%K%P

0xBE0
I leave the row of trees, and exit out onto the paved%Nroad.%K%P

0xBEC
To my surprise, I see Yuka right there.%K%P

0xC00
Makoto「Yuka! ... How's it going? Did you find her?」%K%P

0xC0C
Yuka「No... it was no good.」%K%P

0xC18
Yuka「I also tried asking the people at Tsukiya Hotel, but they%Nsaid they hadn't see a girl like that...」%K%P

0xC24
Makoto「I see. Got it.」%K%P

0xC38
With that, I pick up my pace.%K%P

0xC44
Yuka「H-Hold on, where are you going, Makoto!?」%K%P

0xC50
I hear Yuka's voice from behind.%K%P

0xC5C
Makoto「I have a hunch as to where she is!」%K%P

0xC68
I turn my head and shout this while running.%K%P

0xC74
Yuka「You have a hunch... So where is it!?」%K%P

0xCF4
Makoto「Here...」%K%P

0xD00
With my fingertip, I point it out to Yuka, who followed me%Nthe whole way.%K%P

0xD30
Yuka「By 'here', you can't mean... that shrine?」%K%P

0xD3C
Makoto「Right. It's the 'Shiki no Mori Shrine' Izumi-san told us about.」%K%P

0xD50
Yuka「Kurumi-chan's... in a place like this?」%K%P

0xD5C
Makoto「Yeah, probably.」%K%P

0xD70
I say this, and place my foot on the staircase's first%Nstep.%K%P

0xD7C
But then...!%K%P

0xD88
Yuka「Wait!」%K%P

0xD94
Yuka jerks my arm back.%K%P

0xDA8
Yuka「Don't go!」%K%P

0xDB4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xDC0
Yuka「I'm begging you, don't go!」%K%P

0xDCC
Makoto「Yuka, could it be... you're worried about the rumors%NIzumi-san told us about?」%K%P

0xDD8
Yuka「You're wrong... that's not it.」%K%P

0xDE4
Makoto「Then why!?」%K%P

0xDF0
Yuka「I have... a bad feeling about this.」%K%P

0xDFC
Yuka「A very... bad feeling...」%K%P

0xE08
I know I've heard those words before...%K%P

0xE14
That's right... Two days ago, just before Saki was%Nswallowed by the wave, Yuka said these exact same%Nwords.%K%P

0xE20
At that time, I turned a deaf ear to them...%K%P

0xE2C
Yuka「If you go there, you'll never be able to come back...」%K%P

0xE38
Yuka「So... So no matter what, you mustn't go!」%K%P

0xE54
Makoto「I-I get it...」%K%P

0xE60
Before I know it, I'm answering her with this.%K%P

0xE6C
I might have been overwhelmed by the loneliness in her%Nvoice.%K%P

0xE78
Makoto「But what do we do? What if, by chance, Kurumi is in%Nthere...?」%K%P

0xE84
Yuka「It's all right.」%K%P

0xE90
Yuka「I'll be the one to go look for Kurumi-chan!」%K%P

0xE9C
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0xEA8
Yuka「Makoto, wait here!」%K%P

0xEB4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xEC0
Her unexpected reply has left me dumbfounded.%K%P

0xED4
While I'm at a loss for words, Yuka starts ascending the%Nstaircase herself as if she's trying to brush me aside...%K%P

0xEE0
……………………。%N……………。%N……。%K%P
...%N...%N...%K%P
0xEEC
不意を突かれたオレは、しばらくの間、優夏が登って行った階段の上を茫然と眺めていた。%K%P
Dumbstruck, I watch Yuka ascend the staircase for a%Nshort while.%K%P
0xEF8
しかしやがて……%K%P
But before long...%K%P
0xF04
（何やってんだ？　オレは？）%K%P
(What the hell am I doing?)%K%P
0xF10
……ふと、我に返った。%K%P
... I return to my senses.%K%P
0xF1C
（こんな真夜中に、女の子１人で行かせるなんて、どうかしてた！）%K%P
(I must be out of my mind to let a girl go alone in the dead%Nof night!)%K%P
0xF28
しかもこの神社は、噂によれば危険な場所かもしれないと言う。%K%P
Furthermore, according to the rumors, this shrine might%Nbe a dangerous place.%K%P
0xF34
（なのに男のオレが、こんな所でボケーッと突っ立ってるなんて……！！）%K%P
(Despite that, I just stood here spacing out like an idiot!%NI'm a pathetic excuse for a man!)%K%P
0xF40
オレは慌てて、優夏の後を追いかけた。%K%P
I frantically start chasing after Yuka.%K%P
0xFA0
長い階段を駆け上がると、そこには噂通りのさびれた神社があった。%K%P
When I run up the long staircase, I see a shrine lying%Nthere, just as the rumors said.%K%P
0xFAC
永年潮風にさらされたせいだろうか、外壁から柱からその大きな屋根まで、ありとあらゆる部分が激しく劣化し朽ち果てていた。%K%P
Every part of the shrine, from the outer walls, pillars, and%Neven the large roof, has rotted away extensively,%Nprobably due to many years of being subjected to the%Nsea breeze.%K%P
0xFB8
今この瞬間に倒壊しても不思議ではない。%K%P
It wouldn't be strange for it to collapse this very%Nsecond...%K%P
0xFC4
とは言え、その年老いた風貌にもかかわらず、月明かりに照らされた建物は威風堂々とした印象を与える。%K%P
Nevertheless, despite its decrepit appearance, the%Nbuilding being bathed with moonlight still gives off the%Nimpression of being surrounded by an imposing air.%K%P
0xFD0
まるで何人をも立ち入らせまいとするような拒絶的な威圧感さえ、そこにはあった。%K%P
It's an intimidating atmosphere that feels like it could%Nscare off anyone who tried to trespass on this ground.%K%P
0xFDC
優夏は……神社の前でじっとたたずんでいる。%K%P
Yuka... is standing firmly still in front of the shrine.%K%P
0xFE8
誠「優夏……」%K%P
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P
0xFF4
オレが声をかけると、優夏はくるっと振り向いた。%K%P
When I call out to her, Yuka quickly turns around.%K%P
0x1000
優夏のもとへと駆け寄るオレ。%K%P
I rush over to her.%K%P
0x1014
優夏「なんで……」%K%P
Yuka「Why...」%K%P
0x1020
優夏「あんなに来ちゃダメって……言ったのに……」%K%P
Yuka「Even though I kept telling you... not to come here...」%K%P
0x1034
オレは答えなかった。%K%P
I don't answer her.%K%P
0x1040
優夏の顔さえ見ずに、神社の正面を見上げる。%K%P
Unable to bear the look in her eyes, I instead focus on%Nthe shrine.%K%P
0x104C
その扉は、何故か完全に開け放たれていた。%K%P
For some reason, the door has been completely left%Nopen.%K%P
0x1058
開け放たれていたにもかかわらず、優夏はここに、立ち尽くしている。%K%P
Despite the fact the door is open, Yuka rigidly stands%Nstill.%K%P
0x1064
たぶん怖じ気づいて、中へと入るのにちゅうちょしていたのだろう。%K%P
She's probably gotten cold feet and is hesitant to go%Ninside.%K%P
0x1070
誠「くるみ！」%K%P
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P
0x107C
呼んでみるが、返事はない。%K%P
I try shouting, but there's no response.%K%P
0x1088
ホーホーとどこかでフクロウが鳴いている。%K%P
I hear the lonely hooting of an owl.%K%P
0x1094
オレは遂に意を決し、中へと踏み込んだ……。%K%P
I finally resolve myself, and step inside...%K%P
0x10A8
１歩、そうっと中へと足を忍び入れ、暗がりの中にじっと目を凝らしてみる。%K%P
I quietly sneak a single step inside, and firmly stare in%Nthe darkness.%K%P
0x10B4
優夏もオレの背中に隠れるようにして%Nくっついて来た。%K%P
Yuka follows, trying to hide behind my back.%K%P
0x10C0
そして次の瞬間……%K%P
In the next instant...%K%P
0x10CC
優夏「くるみちゃん……！」%K%P
Yuka「Kurumi-chan...!」%K%P
0x111C
……そこにくるみはいた。%K%P
... Kurumi is over there.%K%P
0x1128
拍子抜けするぐらいにあっさりと見つけることができた。%K%P
It's almost anticlimactic to find her so easily.%K%P
0x1134
くるみは今、床の中央にぺたんとへたり込んでいる。%K%P
Right now, Kurumi is kneeling flat on the center of the%Nfloor.%K%P
0x1140
ぼんやりと宙を漂う視線は、夢でも見ているかのようにうつろだった……。%K%P
Her gaze blankly drifts in space, so blankly that it looks%Nlike she's dreaming...%K%P
0x114C
そばに駆け寄った優夏は、くるみの様子を心配そうに窺っていた。%K%P
Yuka runs to Kurumi's side, and uneasily checks how%Nshe's doing.%K%P
0x1158
ほっと胸を撫で下ろす。%K%P
I sigh in relief.%K%P
0x1164
まあとにかく、無事でなによりだ……。%K%P
Haah... Anyway, what's most important is that she's all%Nright...%K%P
0x1170
ひとまず安心したせいか、まわりを見回す余裕も生まれた。%K%P
Since I'm relieved for the time being, I decide to take the%Ntime to survey my surroundings.%K%P
0x117C
ほぼ正方形の空間……壁と天井には紅い漆（うるし）が塗られていたが、そのほとんどは風化し剥げ落ちている。%K%P
It's an almost perfectly square room... The walls and the%Nceiling are plastered with red varnish, which has almost%Ncompletely weathered and peeled off.%K%P
0x1188
入り口の正面の一段高くなった床の上には小さな社をかたどった祭壇があった。%K%P
A small staircase leads to a floor slightly higher than the%None I'm standing on, and on top of it is an altar modeled%Nafter a small Shinto shrine.%K%P
0x1194
ちょんと軽く突ついただけで%N崩れてしまいそうな程に、激しく劣化している。%K%P
It's so incredibly deteriorated that it feels like just one%Nsmall, light tap is all that's needed to send this whole%Nplace collapsing.%K%P
0x11A0
恐らく、永年の潮風にさらされたせいだろう……。%K%P
It's probably due to the many years of enduring the%Nocean breeze...%K%P
0x11AC
（まあ、そんなことはどうでもいい……）%K%P
(Well, none of this really matters...)%K%P
0x11B8
（取りあえず、この陰気な場所から一刻も早く脱け出そう！）%K%P
(For now, I've got to get out of this gloomy place as%Nsoon as possible!)%K%P
0x11C4
誠「くるみ！　何やってんだ、早く帰るぞ！」%K%P
Makoto「Kurumi! What are you doing? Let's hurry back!」%K%P
0x11D0
言いながら、オレはくるみのそばへと歩み寄る。%K%P
I walk over towards Kurumi's side.%K%P
0x1208
朽ち果てた床がミシッミシッと軋んで今にも抜けそうだ。%K%P
The rotten floor creaks, sounding like it could break any%Nsecond now.%K%P
0x1214
すると……%K%P
Just then...%K%P
0x1220
くるみ「くるみ……ここ覚えてる」%K%P
Kurumi「Kurumi... remembers this place.」%K%P
0x122C
……ふいに、とても小さな声でくるみは呟いた。%K%P
... Kurumi suddenly mutters this in a very small voice.%K%P
0x1238
くるみ「ここ……来たことあるんだ……」%K%P
Kurumi「Kurumi's... been here before...」%K%P
0x1244
優夏「え？　でもくるみちゃん、この神社のことは知らなかったって、前にそう言ってたじゃない？」%K%P
Yuka「Huh? But didn't you say earlier that you'd never heard%Nof this shrine before?」%K%P
0x1250
優夏が聞く。%K%P
Yuka asks this.%K%P
0x125C
くるみ「う、うん。だけど……」%K%P
Kurumi「Y-Yeah. But...」%K%P
0x1268
やや口ごもるくるみ。%K%P
Kurumi hesitates a little.%K%P
0x1274
誠「まあ、とにかくここから出よう。話はその後だ」%K%P
Makoto「Well, anyway, let's get out of here. We can talk about it%Nlater.」%K%P
0x1280
くるみは横に立つオレにチラっと目を向け、小さくコクリと肯いた。%K%P
Still on the floor, Kurumi looks up, shifting her attention to%Nme... and gives me a small nod.%K%P
0x128C
優夏に抱きかかえられるようにして、静かに立ち上がるくるみ。%K%P
Kurumi grabs onto Yuka, and gently stands up.%K%P
0x1298
そうして出口へと向かって歩き出した、その時だった……。%K%P
We then begin walking towards the exit, but at that%Nmoment...%K%P
0x12AC
誠「そんなわけいくかよ！」%K%P
Makoto「Like hell I can just leave it like this!」%K%P
0x12B8
オレは強く言い放った。%K%P
I firmly declare this.%K%P
0x12C4
誠「ここにくるみがいるかもしれないんだぞ？」%K%P
Makoto「Kurumi might be here!」%K%P
0x12D0
誠「確認しなきゃ……。このまま気づかなかったフリして帰るわけにはいかないだろ？」%K%P
Makoto「We need to confirm it... There's no way in hell we can just%Ngo back and pretend we didn't notice this, right?」%K%P
0x12DC
優夏「やだよぉ……」%K%P
Yuka「Don't go...」%K%P
0x12E8
いやだ？　何がそんなに……？%K%P
"Don't go"? Why's she so against this...?%K%P
0x12F4
優夏「誠ぉ……。お願い……」%K%P
Yuka「Makoto... Please...」%K%P
0x1300
誠「ダメだ。ちゃんとした理由もないのに、そんなことはできない」%K%P
Makoto「This is hopeless. You're telling me not to go without a%Nsolid reason.」%K%P
0x130C
誠「探して来るよ……オレ」%K%P
Makoto「I'm... going to go look.」%K%P
0x1318
優夏「…………」%K%P
Yuka「...」%K%P
0x1324
誠「だから優夏は、ここで待ってろ！」%K%P
Makoto「So you wait here, Yuka!」%K%P
0x1338
優夏の腕を振りほどき、神社の階段を駆け上がって行く。%K%P
I shake off Yuka's arm, and begin running up the shrine's%Nstaircase.%K%P
0x1344
優夏「誠ぉ……」%K%P
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P
0x1350
背中に優夏の声を聞く。%K%P
I hear Yuka's voice from behind me.%K%P
0x135C
それは心にじかに触れてくるような、切ない言い方だった。%K%P
She sounds so troubled that it makes my heart ache.%K%P
0x1368
しかしオレは足を止めない。%K%P
However, I don't stop running.%K%P
0x1374
くるみはきっとここにいる！%K%P
Kurumi is definitely here!%K%P
0x1380
……確信に近い感覚をオレは抱いていた。%K%P
... Convicted, I press forward.%K%P
0x13E0
階段を登り切り、境内を駆け抜ける。%K%P
I finish ascending the stairs, and run through the%Ngrounds.%K%P
0x13EC
神社の正面に着いたオレは、大声で呼びかけてみた。%K%P
I reach the front of the shrine, and shout loudly.%K%P
0x13F8
誠「くるみ！」%K%P
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P
0x1420
…………………………。%K%P
...%K%P
0x142C
返事はない。%K%P
No response.%K%P
0x1438
ホーホーと、寂しげなフクロウの鳴き声が聞こえる。%K%P
I hear the lonely hooting of an owl.%K%P
0x1444
オレは意を決し、中へと踏み込んだ。%K%P
I resolve myself, and step inside.%K%P
0x1458
１歩、そうっと中へと足を忍び入れ、暗がりの中にじっと目を凝らしてみる。%K%P
I quietly sneak a single step inside, and firmly stare in%Nthe darkness.%K%P
0x1464
誠「くるみ……！」%K%P
Makoto「Kurumi...!」%K%P
0x14CC
そこにくるみはいた。%K%P
Kurumi is over there.%K%P
0x14D8
拍子抜けするぐらいにあっさりと見つけることができた。%K%P
It's almost anticlimactic to find her so easily.%K%P
0x14E4
くるみは今、床の中央にぺたんとへたり込んでいる。%K%P
Right now, Kurumi is kneeling flat on the center of the%Nfloor.%K%P
0x1500
ぼんやりと宙を漂う視線は、夢でも見ているかのようにうつろだった……。%K%P
Her gaze blankly drifts in space, so blankly that it looks%Nlike she's dreaming...%K%P
0x150C
ホッと、オレは胸を撫で下ろした。%K%P
I sigh in relief.%K%P
0x1518
はぁ……とにかく無事でなによりだ……。%K%P
Haah... Anyway, what's most important is that she's all%Nright...%K%P
0x1524
ひとまず安心したせいか、まわりを見回す余裕も生まれた。%K%P
Since I'm relieved for the time being, I decide to take the%Ntime to survey my surroundings.%K%P
0x1530
ほぼ正方形の空間……壁と天井には紅い漆（うるし）が塗られていたが、そのほとんどは風化し剥げ落ちている。%K%P
It's an almost perfectly square room... The walls and the%Nceiling are plastered with red varnish, which has almost%Ncompletely weathered and peeled off.%K%P
0x153C
入り口の正面の一段高くなった床の上には小さな社をかたどった祭壇があった。%K%P
A small staircase leads to a floor slightly higher than the%None I'm standing on, and on top of it is an altar modeled%Nafter a small Shinto shrine.%K%P
0x1548
ちょんと軽く突ついただけで崩れてしまいそうな程に、激しく劣化している。%K%P
It's so incredibly deteriorated that it feels like just one%Nsmall, light tap is all that's needed to send this whole%Nplace collapsing.%K%P
0x1554
恐らく、永年の潮風にさらされたせいだろう……。%K%P
It's probably due to the many years of enduring the%Nocean breeze...%K%P
0x1560
（まあ、そんなことはどうでもいい……）%K%P
(Well, none of this really matters...)%K%P
0x156C
（取りあえず、この陰気な場所から一刻も早く脱け出そう！）%K%P
(For now, I've got to get out of this gloomy place as%Nsoon as possible!)%K%P
0x1578
誠「くるみ！　何やってんだ、早く帰るぞ！」%K%P
Makoto「Kurumi! What are you doing? Let's hurry back!」%K%P
0x1584
言いながら、オレはくるみのそばへと歩み寄る。%K%P
As I urge Kurumi to move, I walk over towards her side.%K%P
0x15BC
朽ち果てた床がミシッミシッと軋んで今にも抜けそうだ。%K%P
The rotten floor creaks, sounding like it could break any%Nsecond now.%K%P
0x15C8
すると……%K%P
Just then...%K%P
0x15D4
くるみ「くるみ……ここ覚えてる」%K%P
Kurumi「Kurumi... remembers this place.」%K%P
0x15E0
……ふいに、とても小さな声でくるみは呟いた。%K%P
... Kurumi suddenly mutters this in a very small voice.%K%P
0x15EC
くるみ「ここ……来たことあるんだ……」%K%P
Kurumi「Kurumi's... been here before...」%K%P
0x15F8
誠「え？　だけどくるみ、この神社の話は聞いたことないって、前にそう言ってたじゃないか？」%K%P
Makoto「Huh? But a few days ago, you said you'd never heard%Nabout this shrine before, right?」%K%P
0x1604
くるみ「う、うん。だけど……」%K%P
Kurumi「Y-Yeah. But...」%K%P
0x1610
誠「まあ、とにかくここから出よう。話はその後だ」%K%P
Makoto「Well, anyway, let's get out of here. We can talk about it%Nlater.」%K%P
0x161C
くるみは横に立つオレにチラっと目を向け……小さくコクリと肯いた。%K%P
Still on the floor, Kurumi looks up at me... and slightly nods.%K%P
0x1630
オレはくるみを抱きかかえ、そして静かに立ち上がらせた。%K%P
I help Kurumi get up.%K%P
0x163C
出口へと向かって歩き出すと、そこには優夏が立っていた。%K%P
When I start walking towards the exit, I see Yuka%Nstanding there.%K%P
0x1648
誠「優夏……」%K%P
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P
0x165C
優夏「くるみちゃん……大丈夫？」%K%P
Yuka「Kurumi-chan... are you all right?」%K%P
0x1678
くるみ「う、うん……」%K%P
Kurumi「Y-Yeah...」%K%P
0x1684
優夏も、さすがに心配になって追いかけて来たのだろう。%K%P
Yuka probably got very worried and followed after me.%K%P
0x1690
優夏の額には、薄っすらと汗が浮かんでいた。%K%P
She's starting to break into a sweat.%K%P
0x16AC
優夏「さっ……早く帰ろ？」%K%P
Yuka「All right... why don't we hurry back?」%K%P
0x16B8
優夏「みんなくるみちゃんのこと、心配してるんだから……」%K%P
Yuka「Everyone's worried about you, Kurumi-chan...」%K%P
0x16C4
くるみは黙ってうなずくと、出口に向かって歩き始めた。%K%P
When Kurumi silently nods, we begin to walk towards the%Nexit.%K%P
0x16D0
なんだか魂が抜けたような、ぼんやりとした歩き方だった。%K%P
I walk in an absentminded manner, as if my soul was%Nsomehow drained from my body.%K%P
0x1720
優夏「だけどくるみちゃん……どうしてこんなところに？」%K%P
Yuka「But Kurumi-chan... why were you in a place like this?」%K%P
0x172C
──優夏が言ったその時だった。%K%P
―Yuka asks this.%K%P
0x1774
―The sound of a bell!?%K%P

0x1780
I heard it from behind me.%K%P

0x178C
I walk towards the direction the ringing came from, as if%Nit's drawing me in.%K%P

0x1798
When I turn my head, I see Yuka is right behind me,%Nfollowing me.%K%P

0x17A4
Kurumi is leaning on the exit, standing stock still.%K%P

0x1804
I hear the sound of a bell again.%K%P

0x1820
The moonlight shines in from the exit, illuminating the%Nobject... but it's not that bell.%K%P

0x182C
It's a different bell hanging from the eaves of the%Nbuilding modeled after a small Shinto shrine.%K%P

0x1838
It's a copy of the kind of bell with a rope attached to it%Nthat is rung at times of worship.%K%P

0x1844
It's a little larger than the bell in my dream.%K%P

0x1850
But why did the bell ring?%K%P

0x185C
I try gently holding my hands out to the bell.%K%P

0x1868
I realize there's a faint wind blowing from somewhere.%K%P

0x1874
―Is there a draft?%K%P

0x1880
I try looking around and investigating my surroundings.%K%P

0x188C
There's nothing particularly strange that I see.%K%P

0x1898
I look at the bell one more time.%K%P

0x18A4
When I look closely, I notice a tattered piece of%NJapanese paper attached to its back...%K%P

0x18B0
It's a talisman...%K%P

0x18BC
There's something written on it in old-fashioned cursive%Nscript.%K%P

0x18D0
(The spring rain/ At the end of the cape/ Together with/%Nthe echoing bell/ Will free you from time/)%K%P

0x18DC
It's like a waka... But just what does it mean?%K%P

0x18F0
Yuka「Will free you from... time...」%K%P

0x18FC
Suddenly, Yuka mutters this.%K%P

0x1908
Makoto「Yuka... do you understand what it means?」%K%P

0x191C
Yuka「Huh...? N-No...」%K%P

0x1930
Yuka「All right... why don't we hurry back?」%K%P

0x193C
Yuka「Everyone's worried about Kurumi-chan.」%K%P

0x1950
Yuka then turns around and begins to walk towards the%Nexit.%K%P

0x195C
Although I'm harboring this feeling like something's%Nbothering me, I follow after her.%K%P

0x19BC
Kurumi, Yuka and I leave the shrine and walk towards the%Nstaircase.%K%P

0x19C8
Before we step on the first stair, Yuka quickly looks%Naround.%K%P

0x19D4
I also follow her gaze, finding the point she's looking at.%K%P

0x19E0
It's the shrine, its image vaguely materializing in the%Ndarkness...%K%P

0x1A14
A wooden, rectangular sign is hanging under the eaves.%K%P

0x1A20
"Shiki no Mori" ―That's what's written on it.%K%P

0x1A70
Being under the streetlights has made Kurumi and Yuka a%Nlot calmer than they were earlier.%K%P

0x1A7C
However, those two aren't exactly their usual cheery%Nselves either.%K%P

0x1A88
Many different types of fatigue are clearly visible on%Ntheir expressions...%K%P

0x1A9C
Yuka「But what were you doing in a place like that,%NKurumi-chan...?」%K%P

0x1AA8
Yuka gently asks her.%K%P

0x1AB4
Kurumi「Right... for some reason, even when Kurumi returned to%NLunabeach, she just couldn't sit still...」%K%P

0x1AC0
Kurumi「At first, Kurumi was just thinking she'd go to the cherry%Nblossom road and watch the petals fall at night and%Nhead back, but...」%K%P

0x1ACC
Kurumi「On Kurumi's way there, she suddenly... remembered that%Nshrine...」%K%P

0x1AD8
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x1AEC
Kurumi「Listen! You've got to keep this a secret, okay!?」%K%P

0x1AF8
Makoto「A secret?」%K%P

0x1B04
Kurumi「Yep. If there's one person Kurumi doesn't want you%Ntelling, it's Onee-chan!」%K%P

0x1B18
Yuka and I glance at each other.%K%P

0x1B24
We seem to reach an agreement...%K%P

0x1B30
Yuka「Got it.」%K%P

0x1B3C
Makoto「Got it.」%K%P

0x1B48
... as we answer the same way.%K%P

0x1B54
Kurumi goes in between Yuka and I, and grabs our hands.%K%P

0x1B68
Kurumi「That shrine... had a very nostalgic scent to it...」%K%P

0x1B74
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x1B80
Kurumi「It was the smell of the traditional clothes... that Kurumi%Ngot as hand-me-downs from Onee-chan when she was%Nyounger...」%K%P

0x1B8C
Kurumi「That might be why Kurumi was thinking like that.」%K%P

0x1B98
Kurumi「That is to say, why Kurumi thought she'd been there%Nbefore...」%K%P

0x1BA4
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x1BB8
Although I sound like I'm brushing it off, I'm seized by a%Nstrange sense of discomfort.%K%P

0x1BC4
The dusty scent of the shrine and the scent of%NIzumi-san's traditional clothes...%K%P

0x1BD0
No matter how you think about it, they don't sound like%Nthey go together.%K%P

0x1BDC
However, I don't think Kurumi's lying.%K%P

0x1BE8
It's likely that there could have been a subtle fragrance%Nin that shrine that only she recognized.%K%P

0x1BF4
Kurumi tries to keep close to Yuka and I, and before I%Nknow it, she's smiling.%K%P

0x1C84
Kurumi「Kurumi's home～♪」%K%P

0x1C90
When she hears that voice, Izumi-san quickly stands up.%K%P

0x1C9C
Izumi「Kurumi!」%K%P

0x1CA8
Izumi「Geez, just where did you go?」%K%P

0x1CB4
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x1CC0
She sticks out her tongue playfully.%K%P

0x1CDC
Izumi「Don't just go 'eheh♪'! I was really worried about you!」%K%P

0x1CE8
She scolds Kurumi.%K%P

0x1CF4
Izumi「Go ahead and apologize to everyone!」%K%P

0x1D10
Kurumi「Sorry...」%K%P

0x1D1C
Izumi「Oh geez...」%K%P

0x1D30
With the huge wave of relief washing over her, Izumi-san%Nloses her strength and sits down.%K%P

0x1D3C
When I look around the shop, I see the others.%K%P

0x1D50
Yuka「Anyway, I'm glad we found her!」%K%P

0x1D5C
Yuka「Well then, shall we go back?」%K%P

0x1D78
Izumi「Since you went to the trouble of gathering here, would%Nyou at least like some coffee?」%K%P

0x1D84
Makoto「No, it's really late, so we need to head back.」%K%P

0x1D90
Izumi-san nods in disappointment, as if to say, "I%Nunderstand."%K%P

0x1DC4
However...%K%P

0x1DD0
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun, wait a second.」%K%P

0x1DDC
... Just before I try to leave the shop, Izumi-san%Nsuddenly calls out to me, so I stop.%K%P

0x1DF0
Makoto「Huh? What is it?」%K%P

0x1DFC
Izumi「Right... Could you come over here?」%K%P

0x1E10
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x1E1C
I head towards Izumi-san's beckoning form in the corner%Nof the shop.%K%P

0x1E44
Makoto「Do you want to say something that you didn't want the%Nothers to hear?」%K%P

0x1E58
Izumi「Well... It's not like that, but...」%K%P

0x1E64
Izumi-san lowers her head slightly.%K%P

0x1E70
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x1E84
Izumi「U... Umm...」%K%P

0x1E90
Makoto「Yes...?」%K%P

0x1E9C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1EA8
Izumi-san seems to be at a loss of words for some%Nreason.%K%P

0x1EB4
Is it really that hard for her to say it?%K%P

0x1EC0
Izumi「... Umm... Er... Are you free tonight?」%K%P

0x1ECC
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x1ED8
Izumi「Tonight... that's right... Around 3:00, I'll be waiting in front%Nof Lunabeach...」%K%P

0x1EE4
Izumi「Umm... Makoto-kun, I want you to come here at that time.」%K%P

0x1EF0
... Huh?%K%P

0x1EFC
"Tonight at 3:00..." She means 3:00 in the middle of the%Nnight?%K%P

0x1F08
Why... at that time?%K%P

0x1F14
Mmm...%K%N

0x1F20
Well, whatever.%K%N

0x1F2C
I don't really have a reason to refuse.%K%P

0x1F38
Makoto「Yeah, okay. 3:00, right?」%K%P

0x1F44
Izumi「Y... Yes.」%K%P

0x1F58
Izumi-san nods, seeming a bit flustered.%K%P

0x1F64
Although I'm curious about the way she's acting, I decide%Nto not to leave the others waiting and go back with them%Nto the lodge...%K%P

0x1FB8
When I get back, I once again throw myself onto the bed%Nin my room.%K%P

0x1FC4
I'm beyond exhausted, having already surpassed my%Nbody's upmost limits.%K%P

0x1FD0
To ensure I keep my promise with Izumi-san, I set my%Nwatch alarm to 2:20 A.M. ...%K%N

0x1FDC
... I slowly shut my eyes...%K%P

0x2024
When I return to the lodge, I once again throw myself%Nonto the bed in my room.%K%P

0x2030
I'm beyond exhausted, having already surpassed my%Nbody's upmost limits.%K%P

0x203C
I fall asleep the moment I close my eyes...%K%P
