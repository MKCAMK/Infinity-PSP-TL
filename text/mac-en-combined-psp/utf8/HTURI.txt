As her back is turned to me, I can't see Haruka's face,%Nbut Saki's has a strange frown on it.%K%P

0x7C
I rush over to them, the incident from two days ago%Nrushing around in my head.%K%P

0x88
Makoto「What are you two talking about!?」%K%P

0x94
When she hears my voice, Saki turns her back away as if%Nintending to run away.%K%P

0xA8
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0xB4
Without turning around, she starts to run towards her%Nsummer house.%K%P

0xC0
Feeling it's not worth the chase, I turn about to Haruka.%K%P

0xD4
What I see leaves me dumbfounded.%K%P

0xE0
Haruka is smiling widely.%K%P

0xEC
Makoto「Haruka... what happened?」%K%P

0xF8
Haruka「You're late, Makoto. Come on, let's go.」%K%P

0x10C
When I look towards her smiling face, Haruka lightly walks%Nout onto the forest road.%K%P

0x118
Haruka「Hurry, hurry!」%K%P

0x124
Makoto「Y-Yeah... I'm coming.」%K%P

0x130
As I follow Haruka, I fall into deep thought.%K%P

0x13C
So something did happen between them.%K%P

0x148
But she doesn't want to bring it up.%K%P

0x154
That means Haruka's...%K%P

0x1D8
When we arrive at the pier, I try set up the fishing gear,%Njust like yesterday.%K%P

0x1E4
However, I only do so half-heartedly, since my mind's%Npressed on other matters, such as what happened this%Nmorning. Just what happened between Haruka and Saki,%Nanyway?%K%P

0x1F0
Haruka, who doesn't know about my speculating, is%Nhaving a lot of fun.%K%P

0x1FC
While I'm spacing out, she quickly starts setting up her%Nown fishing gear. I know very well that she's excited.%K%P

0x208
It seems that yesterday's session got her completely%Nhooked on fishing.%K%P

0x214
She grips her fishing rod, and after finishing setting it up,%Nshe casts it out into the ocean, just like me.%K%P

0x220
She's a fast learner. As expected from an honor%Nstudent like her. I force myself to think about trivial%Nthings liked that.%K%P

0x22C
Even so, I can't stop myself from thinking about Haruka%Nand Saki.%K%P

0x240
Haruka「All right, let's go.」%K%P

0x24C
Makoto「Say... Haruka...?」%K%P

0x258
Haruka「What?」%K%P

0x264
"I want you to tell me what really happened between you%Nand Saki." But before I can say this...%K%P

0x2DC
We hear a tremendous noise breaking out from the%Nbottom of the earth.%K%P

0x2E8
*Rumble, Rumble, Rumble!* The pier shakes intensely.%K%P

0x2F4
―It's an earthquake.%K%P

0x308
Haruka「Aah...!」%K%P

0x31C
Haruka gulps in astonishment and staggers. I've got to%Nhold on to her!%K%P

0x328
At the same moment I think that, the ground sways%Nintensely.%K%P

0x334
Haruka and I embrace each other, then we're thrown into%Nthe air. We crash onto the ground and roll. We can't stop.%K%P

0x340
As we continue to roll, we try to get caught between the%Npier's stairs to stop ourselves. The tremors also slowly%Nfade...%K%P

0x390
Once I calm down, I help Haruka sit up, and look at her. I've%Nbeen left speechless.%K%P

0x39C
Haruka's black pupils have completely captivated me.%K I%Njust stand there paralyzed by their mesmerizing beauty,%Neven though it feels like she could faint or shut her%Neyes at any moment.%K%P

0x3A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3B4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「Ah... Umm...」%K%P

0x3CC
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x3D8
Makoto「Err... I, uh...」%K%P

0x418
Haruka「... Th-That was surprising.」%K%P

0x424
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x430
Haruka「Weren't you surprised?」%K%P

0x43C
Makoto「Y-Yeah... didn't see that coming...」%K%P

0x448
Haruka「Right...」%K%P

0x478
Haruka silently nods, and we let go of each other's%Nhands as she stands up.%K%P

0x48C
Haruka「Umm...」%K%P

0x498
Makoto「Err...」%K%P

0x4A4
We say it at the same time. We look away from each other,%Nand fall silent.%K%P

0x4B0
A flock of seagulls come flying from the ocean, and let%Nout a loud cry all at once. I nervously open my mouth.%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「... What were you going to say?」%K%P

0x4D0
Haruka「No, it's nothing, nothing at all...」%K%P

0x4DC
Makoto「That's not true, is it?」%K%P

0x4F0
Haruka「Then you go first.」%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「No, go ahead...」%K%P

0x508
Haruka「I'm fine.」%K%P

0x514
Makoto「'I'm fine,' you say...」%K%P

0x520
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5A0
―In the time that exchange happened, the morning%Npassed by.%K%P

0x5AC
As usual, we went to Lunabeach for lunch, then returned%Nto the pier.%K%P

0x5B8
In that time, the awkwardness between us has faded%Naway as Haruka regained her cheerfulness.%K%P

0x5C4
As usual, Haruka is enthusiastically fishing, and as%Nusual, she releases all of the fish she catches.%K%P

0x5D0
As for me... my fishing rod isn't even twitching, as usual%N(to use the phrase one more time).%K%P

0x5E4
Haruka「You're not doing too well. You have no talent for this, do%Nyou?」%K%P

0x5F0
Damn. She's saying that even though she started%Nfishing yesterday...%K%P

0x5FC
But the truth is that I haven't caught a single fish, while%NHaruka seems to be learning so many skills that she's%Ndeveloping her own technique...%K%P

0x608
She really is an unbelievably fast learner... I'm jealous.%K%P

0x640
Haruka「Here, look here, Makoto♪」%K%P

0x64C
It seems she caught another fish.%K%N

0x658
I look at it while gripping my fishing rod.%K%P

0x664
The fish violently scatters water around.%K%N

0x670
A drop of water hits Haruka in the face.%K%N

0x67C
Haruka grimaces from the cold.%K%P

0x688
Seeing that takes me aback, and it feels like my heart's%Nbeen pierced.%K%P

0x694
Haruka's smile, accompanying the blush on her face, is%Ntruly human.%K%N

0x6A0
I would never have expected to see that from the%NHaruka of three days ago...%K%P

0x6AC
Before long, Haruka releases the fish and faces me.%K%P

0x6FC
Haruka「Makoto, do you think fish also have hearts?」%K

0x1480
"I do."

0x148C
"I wouldn't know."

0x744
Makoto「Yeah, I definitely do.」%K%P

0x750
Haruka「... I see.」%K%P

0x764
Makoto「I wouldn't know... I'm not a fish.」%K%P

0x770
Haruka「... That's true.」%K%P

0x77C
Makoto「Well... that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't.」%K%P

0x7A4
Haruka「Have you ever read... 'The Little Mermaid'?」%K%P

0x7B0
Makoto「W-Well... a little...」%K%P

0x7BC
I've never read it, but it's that story by Andersen, right?%NFor the time being, I'll pretend I know it.%K%P

0x7C8
Haruka「You know there was this mermaid princess who fell in%Nlove with a human prince, right?」%K%P

0x7D4
Makoto「Yeah, that's right. She struck a deal with a sea witch to%Nbecome human in exchange for her most important%Npossession... What about it?」%K%P

0x7E0
Haruka「That part doesn't matter...」%K%P

0x7EC
Makoto「Oh, I see...」%K%P

0x7F8
I'm heartbroken. Even though I did my best to remember%Nall of that...%K%P

0x804
Haruka「In the end, she dissolves into foam in the ocean...」%K%P

0x810
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x81C
Haruka「She sacrificed herself to save the prince's life. But%Nbecause she wasn't human, because she had no soul,%Nshe couldn't go to heaven. She just became foam. That's%Nall...」%K%P

0x828
Makoto「N-No, but she saved the prince she loved...」%K%P

0x834
Haruka「The prince never realized that the mermaid princess%Nloved him, or that she saved his life...」%K%P

0x840
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x84C
I understand. I really do understand. A fish's heart? The%Nmermaid princess' feelings?%K%P

0x858
They don't mean anything. That's not what Haruka wants%Nto say!%K%P

0x864
But because I understand what she's alluding to, I can't%Nseem to find the right words to respond.%K%P

0x870
Haruka「I'm a little thirsty.」%K%P

0x87C
Her voice is cracked. I force myself to reply in a cheerful%Ntone.%K%P

0x888
Makoto「Okay then, leave it to me! Wait here, will you?」%K%P

0x8D0
I stand up, and head towards the market.%K%P

0x8DC
It's as if I'm trying to avoid looking at Haruka.%K%P

0x8E8
No, I might not want to look at her.%K%P

0x8F4
I only want to look at the cheerful Haruka.%K%P

0x900
I want her to look away from the problem she thinks she%Nhas from being a clone.%K%P

0x90C
... Before long, I return to the pier...%K%P

0x918
... And am left standing stock-still and dumbfounded.%K%P

0x924
Haruka... has disappeared...%K%P

0x930
I come to my senses, and look at the water from the tip%Nof the bank.%K%P

0x93C
I desperately stare...%K%P

0x948
Wait, what the hell am I thinking?%K%P

0x954
Of course Haruka didn't turn into foam in the water...%K%P

0x9C0
I enter the shopping district to look for Haruka.%K%P

0x9CC
A fisherman told me "It seems that she was headed%Ntowards the shopping district."%K%P

0x9D8
However, I can't find Haruka even in this narrow street.%K%P

0x9E4
(Could it be... that she's running away from me?)%K%P

0x9F0
(... Why would she go that far?)%K%P

0x9FC
My mind is thrown into intense disorder.%K%P

0xA84
While searching for Haruka, I ended up here before I%Neven knew it.%K%P

0xA90
As I look around aimlessly and restlessly, Kurumi calls%Nout to me.%K%P

0xAA4
Kurumi「Huh? Onii-chan, weren't you with Haruka-san?」%K%P

0xAB0
Makoto「Hmm? W-Well, not really...」%K%P

0xABC
It'd be troublesome to explain the situation to Kurumi.%K%N

0xAC8
So that's why I'm lying to her.%K%P

0xAD4
Kurumi「Oh, so Kurumi was wrong. Then she should have called%Nout to her.」%K%P

0xAE0
Makoto「Huh? By 'should have called out to her', does that mean%Nyou 'didn't call out to her'? What do you mean?」%K%P

0xAEC
Kurumi「What are you saying? Isn't it obvious? Kurumi should%Nhave called out to Haruka-san.」%K%P

0xAF8
Makoto「Kurumi! You met up with Haruka!?」%K%P

0xB04
Kurumi「Not really. Kurumi only saw her.」%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「Why didn't you say that earlier!? Where did she go!?」%K%P

0xB1C
Kurumi「What's this... so you two really were together?」%K%P

0xB28
Makoto「It doesn't matter, where is she!?」%K%P

0xB34
Kurumi「She went that way, towards Moon Beach.」%K%P

0xB48
Without another word, I start running. Kurumi's half-angry%Nvoice reaches my ears.%K%P

0xB54
Kurumi「Hey, why is it just 'Haruka-san this, Haruka-san that'?%NStupid Onii-chan!」%K%P

0xB60
I have far more important problems right now. Now's not%Nthe time to hang out with this spoiled kid.%K%P

0xBB0
I jump down to Moon Beach.%K%P

0xBBC
I instantly spot Haruka. When I look around, I can see the%Nentire white, sandy beach that stretches out as far as%Nthe eye can see.%K%PThere is nothing blocking my field of vision, save for a lone,%Nconspicuous figure near a rock wall.%K%P

0xBC8
Although the sand is tripping me up, I run to the rock wall%Nas fast as I can.%K%P

0xBD4
Just then...%K%N

0xBE0
Saki shows up on the opposite side of the beach.%K%P

0xBEC
She's closer to Haruka than I am.%K%N

0xBF8
Saki heads straight towards Haruka, who steels herself%Nand goes out to meet Saki once she notices her.%K%P

0xC04
They instantly begin to quarrel about something, just like%Nthey did back then, just before the high wave struck the%Npier.%K%P

0xC10
I feel my heart beating hard. I take a large roundabout%Npath so they don't notice me, and hide myself on the%Nopposite side of the shade of the rock.%K%P

0xC1C
I can hear them arguing.%K%P

0xC38
Saki「Stop accusing me. I don't have it anymore.」%K%P

0xC44
Haruka「You're lying. You took it away.」%K%P

0xC50
"Took it away"? Took what?%K%P

0xC5C
Saki「Ow! Let me go!」%K%P

0xC68
Haruka「No, I won't.」%K%P

0xC74
Saki「Do you intend to threaten me forever?」%K%P

0xC80
Haruka「Then just give it back to me.」%K%P

0xC8C
Saki「I didn't want to see it again!」%K%P

0xC98
Haruka「Please, stop lying!」%K%P

0xCA4
Saki「I'm not lying!」%K%P

0xCB0
Haruka「You're lying! You're lying! Give it back! Give me back that%N'bell'!」%K%P

0xCD8
―"Bell"!? Did she just say "bell"!?%K%N

0xCE4
The thing Saki stole from Haruka was a "bell"!?%K%P

0xCF0
And in that instant!%K%P

0xD04
A scene flies by my mind...%K%P

0xD10
That hopeless... dream I had... on the morning of the 1st...%K%P

0xD1C
(It couldn't be that the bell they're talking about... is THAT%Nbell!?)%K%P

0xD28
No, that's impossible...%K%N

0xD34
That's impossible...%K%P

0xD48
I shake my head countless times to shake off that%Ndelusion.%K%P

0xD54
(Anyway, right now, I've got to do something about this%Nsituation...)%K%P

0xD60
When I think that, I peek out from the shade of the rock%Nwall, and observe those two.%K%P

0xD6C
Their quarrel has now gotten to a physical level, for the%Ntwo are grappling.%K%P

0xD78
Saki manages to shake Haruka's hands off her, and%Nslowly draws back.%K%P

0xD84
Haruka steadily closes the distance between her and%NSaki as she throws a furious glare at her.%K%P

0xD90
Saki slowly shakes her head.%K%P

0xD9C
Haruka grabs Saki's hand again, but this time― Saki%Nthrusts Haruka away with all her strength!%K%P

0xDA8
Haruka falls flat on her back.%K%N

0xDB4
A cloud of sand blows up and rolls into a small ball, like a%Nshrimp.%K%P

0xDC0
Saki shakes her head once again, trembling slightly, and%Nimmediately breaks off into a run.%K%P

0xDCC
I run out from behind the rock wall and immediately rush%Nover to Haruka's side.%K It seems she's lost%Nconsciousness.%K%P

0xDD8
I lift Haruka up in my arms and shake her body.%K%P

0xDE4
Makoto「Haruka! Haruka! Hang in there!」%K%P

0xDF0
While I shake her, my mind flashes back to the night of%Nthe 1st.%K%P

0xDFC
It was definitely here... on Moon Beach. Back then, I%Npicked up the "bell"... I threw it into the ocean because it%Nscared me for no reason.%K%P

0xE08
If that "bell" is connected to Haruka and Saki somehow,%Nthen what is the meaning of the dream I had?%K%P

0xE14
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0xE20
Suddenly, Haruka's eyes open and move around%Nrestlessly.%K%P

0xE3C
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0xE50
I silently nod. Haruka raises half her body up, and blankly%Nstares into my eyes as I do the same to her.%K

0x1498
Offer my hand to Haruka.

0x14A4
Continue to look at Haruka.

0xEB4
I stretch my hand out to Haruka.%K%P

0xEC0
Haruka quickly yet calmly takes my hand into her own...%K%P

0xECC
I grasp Haruka's hand tightly...%K%N

0xED8
As if to wrap her up in kindness...%K%P

0xEE4
Makoto「I was looking for you...」%K%P

0xEF8
In that moment, Haruka's eyes suddenly overflow with%Ntears.%K%P

0xF30
Haruka firmly squeezes back.%K%P

0xF3C
I stroke her soft cheeks with my other hand.%K%P

0xF48
During this, Haruka lets out small sobs...%K%P

0xF54
Her tears fall onto the back of my hand one by one.%K%P

0xF60
Such... warm tears...%K%P

0xF6C
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xF9C
I continue to look at Haruka.%K%P

0xFA8
Haruka averts her gaze from me.%K%P

0xFB4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xFC0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xFCC
Even so, I continue to peer into Haruka's eyes.%K%P

0xFD8
As if I don't want to lose sight of them again...%K%N

0xFE4
As if I don't want her to forget about me...%K%P

0xFF0
Makoto「I was looking for you...」%K%P

0x1004
In that moment, Haruka's eyes suddenly overflow with%Ntears.%K%P

0x103C
She lets out small sobs...%K%P

0x1048
Her teardrops fall onto the the sandy beach, falling%Ndown one by one...%K%P

0x1054
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x10DC
Haruka and I head towards Lunabeach.%K%P

0x10E8
It's almost time to meet Yuka and the others.%K%P

0x10F4
―After that incident, Haruka and I just quietly passed%Nthe time together.%K%P

0x1100
All while listening to the sea breeze and the roar of the%Nwaves...%K%P

0x110C
We just let time flow by, and even though there was%Nnothing at the beach, the calmness slowly healed%NHaruka's heart.%K%P

0x1118
I didn't ask Haruka anything.%K%P

0x1124
Nothing about the bell, about Saki, or why she even left%Nme at the pier. None of that mattered anymore.%K%P

0x1130
I just watched over Haruka.%K%P

0x113C
I felt that that was all I could do...%K%P

0x1148
Haruka, who's walking beside me, suddenly grabs my arm.%K%P

0x1154
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x1184
Haruka「Will you... will you always help me?」%K%P

0x1190
Makoto「What's with this all of the sudden...?」%K%P

0x119C
Haruka「Will you protect me?」%K%P

0x11A8
Makoto「Well, if it's you...」%K%P

0x11B4
In the instant I'm about to say "Then of course I will,"%NHaruka laughs loudly.%K%P

0x11C8
Haruka「Forget I ever said anything. I need to stop right here!」%K%P

0x11D4
I'm dumbfounded. It's happening again. She's beginning%Nto act strangely cheerful.%K%P

0x11E0
Haruka「Did I surprise you? Sorry for saying something so weird.」%K%P

0x11EC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x11F8
Haruka「I'll be fine. I have to at least deal with my own problems%Nsomehow by myself.」%K%P

0x1204
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x1218
Haruka「Because Makoto is Makoto, and I'm me... isn't that right?」%K%P

0x1224
I look at Haruka, but I've been left at a loss for words.%K%P

0x125C
Haruka and I arrive at Lunabeach almost exactly on time.%K%P

0x1268
Over there, Izumi-san and Kurumi are busy slicing and%Ndicing meat and vegetables.%K%P

0x1274
It seems that a barbecue has been planned from 5:00%Ntoday...%K%P
