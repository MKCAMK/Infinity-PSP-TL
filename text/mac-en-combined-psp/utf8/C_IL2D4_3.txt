An hour has already passed since the barbecue began.%K%P

0xC8
Everything is calm as we fool around and poke fun at%Neach other... It's as noisy as ever.%K%P

0x114
Yuka「Woohoo～～～! Woohoohoohoo～～～!」%K%P

0x138
Yuka「Meat, meat, meat man♪ Meat, meat, meat time♪」%K%P

0x14C
Yuka「Jumping! Chop green peppersh up intoo bitsh!」%K%P

0x160
Yuka「Shtrummin'... shtrummin'...♪」%K%P

0x16C
Yuka「Shunshet... grilled meat... companionsh on da River%NShtyksh～♪」%K%P

0x178
Yuka's the same as always...%K%P

0x1B0
While that's going on, a smile rises to Izumi-san's face.%K%P

0x1BC
After what happened earlier, I could barely picture her%Nwith such a serene smile on.%K%P

0x1C8
(Did something happen?)%K%P

0x1E4
(Perhaps my words back then might have changed%Nsomething within Izumi-san.)%K%P

0x1F0
(Did she resolve herself to tell them everything?)%K%P

0x204
(Perhaps my words back then might have eased%NIzumi-san's worries.)%K%P

0x210
(I guess you could say she's unbounded... or perhaps%Nfeeling refreshed...)%K%P

0x21C
At any rate, Izumi-san's beaming smile has brought me%Npeace of mind.%K%P

0x228
Now that I think about it, I haven't seen Izumi-san%Nsincerely smile like that recently.%K%P

0x234
The grin of hers that I haven't seen in a while is radiant,%Nlike a flame consuming firewood.%K%P

0x250
(Nevertheless...)%K%P

0x288
I look back and forth between Kurumi and Haruka's%Nfaces, and compare them.%K%P

0x294
(Now that I think about it, they certainly do resemble%Neach other, but...)%K%P

0x2A0
(Haruka being what Kurumi will look like in a year and four%Nmonths...)%K%P

0x2AC
(... And Kurumi being what Haruka looked like a year and%Nfour months ago...)%K%P

0x2B8
(Mmm... I can't really picture that...)%K%P

0x314
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan!」%K%P

0x320
Kurumi「What are you staring at people's faces for!?」%K%P

0x32C
Makoto「Huh? O-Oh... sorry.」%K%P

0x340
Kurumi「Ah-ha...」%K%P

0x34C
Kurumi「Were you charmed?」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x36C
Kurumi「You lost yourself when you looked at this young%Nmaiden's smooth skin illuminated by the bonfire, didn't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x378
Makoto「What are you talking about?」%K%P

0x38C
Kurumi「Oh geez, you don't have to hide it♪」%K%P

0x398
Makoto「... Ah! That's right, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x3AC
Remembering something, I take Kurumi out of the circle%Nwith me.%K%P

0x3EC
Kurumi「Geez, what is it? Why'd you take Kurumi here all of the%Nsudden?」%K%P

0x3F8
Kurumi「If we don't hurry, then the meat reserved for Kurumi will%Nbe taken away.」%K%P

0x404
Makoto「Oh, it's all right, this will be quick...」%K%P

0x410
Makoto「There's something I want to ask you.」%K%P

0x424
Kurumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0x430
Makoto「It's about this afternoon...」%K%P

0x43C
Kurumi「This afternoon?」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「Kurumi... you left Lunabeach to chase Haruka, right?」%K%P

0x45C
Kurumi「Oh, you mean back then.」%K%P

0x468
Makoto「So, was Haruka okay with it in the end?」%K%P

0x47C
Kurumi「With what?」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「The amusement park!」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「Didn't you say something like 'It's okay if we go%Ntogether'?」%K%P

0x4A8
Kurumi「Hmm... Kurumi might have said it... or she might not have...」%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「What's with that answer?」%K%P

0x4C8
Kurumi「Because Kurumi forgot.」%K%P

0x4D4
Kurumi「We didn't really talk about the amusement park...」%K%P

0x4E0
Makoto「Then what did the two of you talk about for so long?」%K%P

0x4EC
Kurumi「Nothing.」%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x50C
Kurumi「Kurumi went fishing with Haruka-san♪」%K%P

0x518
Kurumi「The two of us got really engrossed in it...」%K%P

0x524
Makoto「So are you saying the two of you didn't say a single%Nword to each other?」%K%P

0x538
Kurumi「Well, we did talk about some trifling things...」%K%P

0x544
Kurumi「―Ah!」%K%P

0x550
Kurumi「Now that Kurumi thinks about it, she did hear one%Ninteresting thing.」%K%P

0x55C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x568
Kurumi「The story of The Moon and the Jellyfish...」%K%P

0x574
Makoto「The Moon and the Jellyfish?」%K%P

0x580
Kurumi「Yeah. And you know what? Kurumi knows that story too.」%K%P

0x58C
Makoto「Huh...」%K%P

0x5A0
Kurumi「Don't just go 'Huh'! It was quite a surprise!」%K%P

0x5AC
Makoto「Why?」%K%P

0x5C0
Kurumi「Because Kurumi thought that only she and Onee-chan%Nknew this story.」%K%P

0x5CC
Kurumi「Kurumi thought that it was a fairy-tale that her Papa%Nmade up all on his own.」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5E4
Kurumi「But Haruka-san knows it, so maybe it's a well-known%Nstory?」%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「P-Perhaps...」%K%P

0x5FC
I do everything I can just to force out this one word%Nreply.%K%P

0x618
I told Izumi-san that she should "tell them everything",%Nbut it would be ridiculous for an outsider like me to tell%Nthem.%K%P

0x624
In the first place, there's no way in hell that I could say%N'Kurumi's and Haruka's father is the same person', in this%Ncheerful atmosphere!%K%P

0x630
Anyway, all I can do is...%K

0x63C
Get her to drop this topic right away.%K%P

0x660
Just then, I see...%K%P

0x690
Yuka「'Hey dere♪」%K%P

0x69C
... Yuka coming towards us with tottering steps.%K%P

0x6A8
Yuka「What're yuu doin', shneakin' off like dat?」%K%P

0x6B4
Makoto「We weren't really sneaking off... right, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x6C0
Kurumi「Yeah... we weren't.」%K%P

0x6D4
Yuka「Hmm... den dash faine.」%K%P

0x6E8
Kurumi「Anyway, Yuka-san?」%K%P

0x6F4
Kurumi calls out to her...%K%N

0x700
But Yuka seems to be thinking about something, as she%Ncompletely ignores Kurumi...%K%P

0x714
Yuka「Hey♪ Mako-tan♪」%K%P

0x728
Suddenly, Yuka sashays towards me while speaking%Nseductively.%K%P

0x73C
Yuka「Wen dis ish over♪...」%K%P

0x748
Yuka「... lesh plei a fun game... all in sheecret♪」%K%P

0x754
Her gaze is going everywhere...%K%P

0x760
She rubs against my collarbone with her right index%Nfinger.%K%P

0x774
Yuka「I borrowed dem earlier♪」%K%P

0x780
Yuka「... Da toolsh, dat ish♪」%K%P

0x78C
Yuka puts her left hand in her pocket as she tampers%Nwith the "tools", twisting and turning them.%K%P

0x798
Kurumi「―GEEZ! ―Yuka-san!」%K%P

0x7AC
Yuka「Huh? Whaa?」%K%P

0x7C0
When she hears Kurumi's angry shout, Yuka finally%Nleaves me alone.%K%P

0x7D4
Kurumi「Kurumi wants to ask you something!」%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x7F4
Kurumi「Yuka-san, do you know... about 'The Moon and the%NJellyfish'?」%K%P

0x800
Yuka「Huh? 'Da Lunatic Shellfish'?」%K%P

0x814
Kurumi「Right, right, there was once this shellfish who one day%Nwent absolutely ins-」%K%P

0x828
Kurumi「Hey, that's not it!」%K%P

0x834
Kurumi「There's no such story out there! In the first place, even%Nif a shellfish went insane, what could it possibly do!?」%K%P

0x848
Kurumi「Kurumi is talking about The Moon and the Jellyfish!」%K%P

0x85C
Yuka「Ah, right right...」%K%P

0x868
Yuka「Da Dune and...」%K%P

0x874
Yuka「... da Shmelly Witch, right?」%K%P

0x888
Kurumi「Right, right. There was once this really smelly witch who%Nlived in the desert and-」%K%P

0x89C
Kurumi「Hey, that's just plain weird!」%K%P

0x8A8
Kurumi「There's no way such a bizarre story would be well known!」%K%P

0x8CC
―And at that time!%K%P

0x8F4
The sound of water splashing echoes!%K%P

0x90C
This sound... It's exactly like the one I heard at the last%Nbarbecue.%K%P

0x918
I don't need to turn around to understand the situation.%K%P

0x924
Saki's hand accidentally slipped, and she spilled the%Nbeer in her paper cup on Yuka.%K%P

0x930
―Huh...??? Yuka???%K%P

0x93C
But Yuka's in front of me right now, isn't she?%K%P

0x948
(Which means...?)%K%P

0x990
I try slowly turning around...%K%P

0x99C
By the iron plate... Saki is holding a now empty paper cup.%K%P

0x9A8
And the beer has landed on...%K%P

0x9E8
―Haruka!%K%P

0x9F4
Haruka's clothes are soaked from her chest to the%Nbottom of her shirt.%K%P

0xA00
(I see...)%K%P

0xA0C
Because Yuka and Kurumi weren't there to act as a wall,%NHaruka was directly hit instead...)%K%P

0xA18
Haruka「... Hey... Saki...」%K%P

0xA34
Saki「... S-Sorry.」%K%P

0xA40
Everyone becomes completely silent.%K%P

0xA4C
Saki「I'm really sorry.」%K%P

0xA58
... Her words are sincerely apologetic.%K%P

0xA6C
As a further gesture of apology, Saki begins to wipe the%Nbeer off of Haruka's clothes with a dish cloth.%K%P

0xA78
To me and Izumi-san, who remember what happened last%Ntime, this scene is hard to believe.%K%P

0xA94
Yuka「Geesh, Shaki, ah yuu sure yuur naht drunk?♪」%K%P

0xAB0
Okuhiko「Ha ha, that was pretty careless of you, Saki-chan♪」%K%P

0xACC
Kurumi「Kyahahaha...」%K%P

0xAE8
Saki「Ahahahaha...」%K%P

0xAFC
Everyone「Kyahahahahahaha...♪」%K%P

0xB24
... Everyone bursts into laughter.%K%P

0xB30
They cheerfully laugh at Saki's blunder, as if trying to%Npoke fun at her and brush the incident off.%K%P

0xB3C
Only Haruka isn't laughing, but it's clear she's not%Noffended, and seems to be taking it in good humor.%K%P

0xB48
A faint smile even rises to her face.%K%P

0xB54
It's as if... anything and everything's all changed.%K%P

0xB60
The atmosphere from last time has suddenly changed to%Na harmonious one.%K%P

0xB6C
Izumi-san and I exchange glances...%K%P

0xB78
... And we begin to laugh as well.%K%P

0xB84
All suspicions that this is just a delusion in my head%Nhave disappeared.%K%P

0xB90
I am confident that this pleasant scene before me can%Nonly be reality.%K%P

0xBA4
Haruka「... Mmm...」%K%P

0xBB0
Haruka「... The beer stinks...」%K%P

0xBBC
Haruka frowns as she pinches at her clothes...%K%P

0xBF4
After that...%K%P

0xC00
Our laughter doesn't cease until the barbecue ends...%K%P

0xC0C
As a result, Kurumi's disappearance never occurs...%K%P

0xC18
The night just silently goes on...%K%P

0xC34
... ... ...%K%P
