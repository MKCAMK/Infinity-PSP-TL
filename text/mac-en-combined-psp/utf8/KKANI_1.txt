0x7F4
Kurumi「Ring out! Sumo Crab wins♪」%K%P

0x800

0x80C

0x874
Kurumi「It's true.」%K%P

0x880
Makoto「Then what kinds of worries are you talking about?」%K%P

0x88C
Kurumi「Umm... umm...」%K%P

0x898
Kurumi「For example... getting to the final level of Treasure Strike,%Nonly to find she can't beat it no matter what.」%K%P

0x8A4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8EC
... ... ...%K%P

0x8F8

0x950
Kurumi「... It's over.」%K%P

0x95C
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x984
Kurumi and I stare the empty arena, wrapped up in a%Nstillness like the kind you feel at the end of a party.%K%P

0x998

0x9A4

0xAA0
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0xAB4
This might be the strongest earthquake I've felt in my%Nfew days here.%K%P

0xAC0
We support each other, and wait for the tremors to%Nsubside.%K%P

0xACC
... Before long, the tremors die down, as if they're being%Npulled away by the waves.%K%P

0xB1C
Kurumi「... It's calmed down.」%K%P

0xB28
Makoto「That sure came out of nowhere...」%K%P

0xB34
We take a breath, and walk over to the basket with our%Nlunches in it.%K%P

0xB40
...%K%P

0xB4C
We stuff ourselves with the sandwiches that it seems%NIzumi-san made for us.%K%P

0xB58
Makoto「... I'm really grateful to you and Izumi-san.」%K%P

0xB64
Having calmed down after having a sip of black tea, I%Nsay this.%K%P

0xB78
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xB84
With a sandwich crammed in her mouth, Kurumi gives me a%Npuzzled expression.%K%P

0xB90
Makoto「Even though we're unrelated to you, you've done so%Nmuch for us...」%K%P

0xB9C
Makoto「Especially Izumi-san; if she weren't here, then we'd%Nprobably be starving to death right about now...」%K%P

0xBA8
Kurumi「... Mmm... It's fine, it's fine～♪ Don't worry about it so much.」%K%P

0xBB4
Kurumi swallows the sandwich in one gulp.%K%P

0xBC0
Kurumi「Besides, it's not like Onee-chan is unrelated to you.」%K%P

0xBCC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xBD8
Kurumi「Because at Onii-chan's college, Onee-chan...」%K%P

0xBEC
Kurumi「... Oh.」%K%P

0xC14
Kurumi stops talking and places a hand over her mouth%Nas if to say "oh, crap." She's wearing the guilty face of a%Nchild who's been caught with their hand in a cookie jar.%K%P

0xC20
Makoto「My college...? ... What do you mean by that?」%K%P

0xC34
Kurumi「W-Who knows...? Now that Kurumi really thinks about it,%Nthey're completely unrelated.」%K%P

0xC40
Makoto「H-Hey! Don't play dumb...」%K%P

0xC54
Kurumi「Ah! Kurumi just remembered she has an important errand%Nto take care of! ... See you, Onii-chan♪」%K%P

0xC60
Makoto「Ah! Kurumi!? Hold on!!」%K%P

0xC84
...%K%P

0xC90
... Kurumi takes the basket with sandwiches.%K%P

0xC9C
I'm still hungry...%K%P
