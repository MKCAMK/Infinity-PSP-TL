(... It's chilly.)%K%P

0x138
(No, it's worse... it's freezing.)%K%P

0x1C4
When my eyes snap open, I discover that my whole body%Nis soaked with water and that I'm chilled to the bone.%K%P

0x1D0
... Rain?%K%N

0x1DC
... It's raining?%K%N

0x1E8
Small droplets of water bolt down from the sky.%K%P

0x1F4
When I look beside me, I see that Haruka is still sleeping.%K%N

0x200
Although she's sleeping soundly, her body is violently%Nshivering.%K%P

0x20C
Haruka and I are already wet to the skin.%K%N

0x218
No wonder we're cold.%K%P

0x230
(We have to quickly return to the lodge...)%K%P

0x23C
I shake Haruka.%K%P

0x248
Makoto「Haruka. Hey, Haruka...」%K%P

0x26C
Haruka's eyes slowly open.%K%P

0x278
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「Are you fully awake?」%K%P

0x2AC
Haruka「Yes... Ah...」%K%P

0x2C0
It seems that Haruka's also finally noticed that it's%Nraining.%K%P

0x2CC
Makoto「We're completely soaked.」%K%P

0x2D8
All I can do is smile.%K%P

0x2EC
Haruka also smiles a bit and nods.%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Let's go back now.」%K%P

0x304
I stand up.%K%P

0x318
I take Haruka's hand and help her up.%K%N

0x324
I tug at her hand, expecting her to get up.%K%N

0x330
However, she doesn't budge.%K%P

0x33C
Makoto「Haruka?」%K%P

0x350
Haruka looks up at the sky.%K%N

0x35C
She just seems to be staring at it.%K%P

0x368
I also look up at the sky.%K%P

0x390
Only rain clouds can be seen in this darkness.%K%N

0x39C
No... there's also what's falling down from above... the rain.%K%N

0x3A8
The rain...?%K%N

0x3B4
I see...%K%P

0x3C0
Haruka is staring at the rain.%K%N

0x3CC
The endlessly pouring rain.%K%P

0x3D8
"Water."%K

0x3E4
Haruka is looking at the "water" falling from the sky, not%Nshowing the slightest hint of movement.%K%N

0x3F0
Her eyes... are focusing intensely on it.%K%P

0x408
Makoto「... Haruka?」%K%P

0x414
I call out to her.%K%N

0x438
Haruka turns towards me.%K%N

0x444
Her face, wet with "water", has an ethereal beauty to it.%K%P

0x450
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x45C
I look at her.%K%N

0x468
Haruka stares right back at me.%K%P

0x474
Makoto「... We're going to catch a cold like this, so... shouldn't we%Nhead back?」%K%P

0x480
I finally say this.%K%N

0x48C
Haruka continues to stare.%K%P

0x4A0
She then nods.%K%P

0x4AC
She walks towards me.%K%N

0x4C0
I embrace Haruka's body.%K%N

0x4CC
We hold each other close as we leave leave Princess%NBeach.%K%P

0x538
The rain grows stronger.%K%P

0x544
Haruka and I walk towards the lodge. However, we walk%Nslowly because of how long we've been out.%K%P

0x550
We don't have an umbrella, so we're already completely%Nsoaked. In addition, our clothes are very heavy after%Nabsorbing all of that water.%K%P

0x568
I encourage Haruka to cheer myself up.%K%P

0x574
Makoto「When we get back, we can take a bath, change our%Nclothes, and then...」%K%P

0x598
Haruka「... Sleep for a long time.」%K%P

0x5A4
Haruka continues for me.%K%P

0x5F4
Haruka「Ah...!」%K%P

0x600
Suddenly, Haruka lets out a small gasp.%K%N

0x60C
It happens just at a point where the forest path is%Nvisible from the coastline road.%K%P

0x618
Makoto「What's wrong?」%K%P

0x624
Haruka「Over there...」%K%P

0x630
Haruka points at the end of the road.%K%P

0x63C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x648
When I shift my attention towards the direction she's%Npointing at...%K%N

0x654
... I see a lone puppy standing in the corner of the road.%K%P

0x660
It's become sullied with tons of mud. I notice that it%Ndoesn't have a collar around its neck, so it doesn't%Nseem to be anyone's pet.%K%N

0x66C
Is it... a stray?%K%P

0x680
Haruka「That dog...」%K%P

0x68C
Makoto「Huh? Haruka, do you know that dog?」%K%P

0x698
Haruka nods. Just like that, she approaches the puppy...%K%N

0x6A4
She picks it up in her arms, and lovingly pets it on the%Nhead.%K%P

0x6CC
The puppy barks.%K%P

0x700
Haruka「This dog... is Saki's.」%K%P

0x70C
Makoto「Saki's...?」%K%P

0x718
I'm a bit surprised that Saki owns a dog.%K%P

0x724
Makoto「Wow... so Saki owns this dog...」%K%P

0x740
Haruka「It doesn't seem like she... exactly owns it.」%K%P

0x74C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x758
Haruka「It seems that Saki has always been affectionate to this%Ndog...」%K%P

0x764
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x770
Haruka「... It seems she's always giving it food.」%K%P

0x77C
Haruka「That's why it got incredibly attached to her...」%K%P

0x788
Makoto「Huh...」%K%P

0x794
Haruka「Do you remember... the beef?」%K%P

0x7A0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x7AC
Haruka「From the barbecue...」%K%P

0x7B8
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x7C4
I remember.%K%N

0x7D0
The turmoil from that barbecue... the beef that fell from%NSaki's bag...%K%P

0x7DC
Haruka「It... seems like she had planned to give it to this puppy.」%K%P

0x7E8
Makoto「... You think so?」%K%P

0x7F4
Haruka「Yes... I do.」%K%P

0x800
Haruka「Saki... She really is a kind girl as well...」%K%P

0x80C
I look at Haruka's face.%K%P

0x820
Haruka「But...」%K%P

0x82C
Haruka stops petting the puppy.%K%P

0x840
Haruka「But... if so, then why...?」%K%P

0x868
Her voice is trembling. She's crying.%K%N

0x874
The rain falling from the sky merges with her tear%Nstricken face...%K%P

0x880
Haruka had been trying her best to bottle her tears up,%Nbut she's finally releasing them...%K%P

0x88C
Haruka and Saki. Just what happened between them!?%K%N

0x898
It disturbs me.%K The bell...?%K Is it because of the bell...?%K%P

0x8A4
There's got to be a deeper meaning behind their feud%Nthat I'm overlooking or misunderstanding.%K%N

0x8B0
I need answers.%K I make up my mind and decide to ask%Nabout it.%K%P

0x8CC
Makoto「Haruka... let me ask you just one thing.」%K%P

0x8D8
Only Haruka's face turns towards me.%K%P

0x8E4
Makoto「Would you tell me about the bell?」%K%P

0x8F8
Haruka「!!!」%K%P

0x904
Her thin shoulders tremble with a start. Her expression%Ninstantly freezes.%K%P

0x910
Makoto「You can't...? Is it something you can't tell me...?」%K%P

0x924
Haruka crosses her arms across her chest as she tries%Nto steady her now trembling body.%K%P

0x930
Makoto「It might put you at ease if you talk, even if it's just with%Nsomeone as ignorant as me.」%K%P

0x93C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x950
Before long... she turns about towards me, as if having%Nsteeled herself. And then, she nods.%K%P

0x95C
Haruka「I understand... I'll tell you.」%K%P

0x968
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x974
I hold my breath in anticipation, awaiting Haruka's next%Nwords.%K%P

0x98C
Haruka tries to say something...%K%N

0x998
... But then, at that exact moment...%K%P

0x9BC
Haruka's eyes widen.%K%P

0x9C8
Haruka「...!! ... Saki!?」%K%P

0x9D4
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x9E8
Haruka's gaze is focused behind me.%K%N

0x9F4
I quickly turn around...%K%P

0xA24
... To find Saki, frozen in place with an umbrella in hand.%K%P

0xA30
She stares at us for a while, standing rigidly in place.%K%P

0xA3C
Saki「...」%K%P

0xA48
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0xA5C
Suddenly, Saki turns around. She's trying to head back%Nthe way she came.%K%P

0xA94
When it sees this, the puppy jumps out from Haruka's%Narms..%K%P

0xAA0
It bolts off to chase Saki.%K%N

0xAAC
It crosses the wet road diagonally...%K%P

0xAB8
―And in the next instant!%K%P

0xB00
A intense flash pierces my eyes.%K%N

0xB0C
I reflexively put my hand over my eyes and squint.%K%P

0xB6C
When I look, I see a car with its headlights on...%K%N

0xB78
―It's approaching from the other side of the curve!%K%P

0xB8C
Saki「!!!」%K%P

0xB98
Saki turns around and lets out a small scream.%K%P

0xBA4
The puppy is running towards Saki at full speed.%K%N

0xBB0
It hasn't noticed the car! It can only see Saki, who's right%Nbefore its eyes!%K%P

0xBFC
A sharp honk comes from the car!%K%P

0xC10
Haruka「!!」%K%P

0xC24
Haruka suddenly moves.%K%N

0xC30
She rushes out onto the road, running to the puppy.%K%P

0xC3C
Makoto「―Haruka!」%K%P

0xC48
Haruka quickly picks the puppy up in her arms.%K%P

0xC54
Immediately afterwards, the bright red frame of the car%Ndraws near her!%K%P

0xD20
Makoto「...!!!!」%K%P

0xD2C
Saki「!!!!」%K%P

0xD54
Saki places her hand over her mouth, frozen in place. I%Ncan't... move either.%K%P

0xD60
Saki and I are watching Haruka's body... which has been%Nsent flying...%K%P

0xD6C
It all happens as if it's in slow motion. Haruka's body%Nslowly, slowly draws an arc in midair.%K%P

0xDDC
Her slender body falls onto the asphalt face-up... as if%Nit's been thrown onto it.%K%P

0xDE8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xDF4
Saki「...」%K%P

0xE00
Time stops.%K%P

0xE34
Haruka had firmly held the puppy against her chest, and%Nit's still there, completely unharmed.%K%P

0xE40
The puppy slightly shakes its now soaked head, worms%Nits way out of Haruka's arms, and jumps off of her.%K%P

0xE4C
It starts to run over towards Saki's feet as if nothing%Nhappened...%K%P

0xE58
Haruka's body is illuminated by the headlights, her pale%Nfigure sticking out in the downpour.%K%P

0xE74
My legs won't stop shaking. I can't move my stiffened%Nlimbs.%K%N

0xE80
Saki is also silently standing stock-still, oblivious to the%Nplayful puppy at her feet.%K%P

0xE8C
Makoto「... H-Haru... ka...?」%K%P

0xE98
My voice has never trembled this much before in my life.%K%N

0xEA4
Saki's eyes well with tears, and she slowly shakes her%Nhead back and forth.%K%P

0xEB0
This isn't happening. This has got to be some kind of mistake...%K%PI refuse to believe that this is reality.%K%P

0xF18
A red liquid on the asphalt catches my eye.%K%N

0xF24
Blood...%K A large quantity of fresh red blood is pouring out%Nof Haruka's body.%K%P

0xF30
It slowly begins to spread, soaking the already wet%Nasphalt...%K%P

0xF3C
Makoto「HARUKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!」%K%P

0xF48
I wring out a loud scream from within my body...%K%P

0xFE0
Anyway, we need an ambulance.%K%N

0xFEC
I survey the surrounding area.%K%N

0xFF8
But there's no pay phones anywhere around here.%K%P

0x1004
I rush over towards Haruka. Maybe I can stop the%Nbleeding.%K But I don't know how to do that.%K My mind goes%Ncompletely blank again.%K%P

0x1010
Haruka continues to bleed before my eyes, but all I can%Ndo is numbly stare, dumbfounded.%K%P

0x101C
The driver of the car is the same.%K%P

0x1028
But then, I come to my senses.%K%P

0x1040
Makoto「Please take her to the local clinic!」%K%P

0x104C
I turn to the driver, and shout this.%K%P

0x1058
The driver nods countless times as he trembles in horror.%K%P

0x107C
Saki「Wait! You can't do that!!」%K%P

0x1088
Makoto「...!?」%K%P

0x1094
Saki「We can't leave this to the person who did this to Haruka!」%K%P

0x10A0
Makoto「Now's not the time to be saying that, is it!?」%K%P

0x10AC
Saki「Have you lost your mind!?」%K%P

0x10B8
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0x10C4
Saki「Anyway, I'm completely against it!」%K%P

0x10D0
Makoto「Saki... think carefully. Think about why it is that Haruka%Nwent running out on the road in the first place...」%K%P

0x10E4
Saki「Makoto-kun...!?」%K%P

0x10F0
Makoto「Anyway, this isn't the time to argue.」%K%P

0x10FC
Makoto「We have to get Haruka to the clinic as soon as possible...」%K%P

0x1110
Saki「But, but...」%K%P

0x111C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1128
I stay silent. There's no longer any time to persuade her.%K%P

0x1134
Makoto「Help me out!」%K%P

0x1140
I ignore Saki and ask the driver this. The driver nods and%Nlends me a hand.%K%N

0x114C
The two of us gently lift Haruka up into our arms and%Nbring her in the car.%K%P

0x1158
Makoto「Saki, hurry up!」%K%P

0x116C
Saki「... Understood.」%K%P

0x119C
Saki and I get into the car.%K The driver slams the%Naccelerator while he desperately tries to calm down his%Nfrantically trembling body.%K%P

0x11C4
Haruka, Saki, and I ride in the car towards the clinic in the%Npouring rain...%K%P

0x1244
It's been approximately half an hour since we arrived at%Nthe clinic.%K%P

0x126C
We woke up the sleeping doctor and quickly brought%NHaruka into the sickroom.%K%P

0x12CC
With his skillful handling, the doctor performs%N"hemostasis treatment", which seems to have at least%Nsuccessfully stopped the bleeding.%K%P

0x12D8
However, by the looks of things, I know that it's too early%Nto jump to conclusions.%K%P

0x1300
Doctor「... I hate to tell you this, but...」%K%P

0x130C
The doctor says this with a grim expression.%K%P

0x1318
Doctor「She's already lost most of the blood in her body... Her%Nblood pressure is already considerably low...」%K%P

0x1324
A chill runs down my spine.%K%N

0x1330
My throat dries up to the point where I can't even speak.%K%P

0x133C
... Certainly, Haruka's face is unbelievably pale.%K%N

0x1348
According to the doctor, if a person loses one-third of%Nthe blood in their body, then they could die of blood loss.%K%P

0x1354
We don't know how much blood Haruka has lost, but it%Nseems there's no mistake that she's in a considerably%Ncritical condition right now.%K%P

0x1360
Doctor「She only... has an hour or two left...」%K%P

0x136C
Saki「No way!」%K%P

0x1378
Makoto「... Can't you... Can't something be done!?」%K%P

0x1384
Doctor「A blood transfusion... As long as she has a blood%Ntransfusion, she might recover somehow.」%K%P

0x1390
Doctor「Her blood type is B-... Are either of you B- or O-?」%K%P

0x139C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x13A8
Saki「...」%K%P

0x13B4
... How can this be!?%K There's no one here with the same%Nblood type as Haruka!%K%P

0x13C0
Makoto「C-Can we request for blood...?」%K%P

0x13CC
Doctor「If they were to transport it via helicopter... in this%Nweather... I estimate that it would roughly take about four%Nhours to arrive.」%K%P

0x13D8
Makoto「F... Four hours!?」%K%P

0x13E4
Saki「No way... Then it'd never make it on time...」%K%P

0x13F0
Saki「This can't... this can't be happening!」%K%P

0x13FC
Saki's voice is trembling. I instinctively grab the doctor.%K%P

0x1408
Makoto「Hey! You're a doctor, aren't you!? Do something for her!」%K%P

0x1414
Doctor「... At the very least, if I had blood of the right blood type,%NI could save her...」%K%P

0x1420
Makoto「You've got blood too, don't you!? Why don't you do%Nsomething with it!?」%K%P

0x142C
Doctor「If I had blood of one of the proper blood types, I would,%Nbut... I don't.」%K%P

0x1438
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1444
I let go of the doctor. I then stagger backwards and%Ncollapse to my feet, clutching my head.%K%P

0x1450
Fuck... Why!? Why did it have to turn out this way...%K%N

0x145C
If my blood were of the right type...%K and if it meant saving%NHaruka, I would readily give it all to her!!!%K%P

0x1468
Doctor「Since we don't have any blood of the right types... it's%Nunfortunately... too late...」%K%P

0x1474
Those words bitterly pierce my heart.%K%P

0x1480
Saki「Don't give me that bullshit! Why does Haruka have to%Ndie!? Why the hell are you saying something like that!?」%K%P

0x148C
Saki yells at the doctor. She grabs him by the collar of%Nhis white coat, and glares at him with tears in her eyes.%K%P

0x1498
Makoto「... Stop it, Saki. Stop it...」%K%P

0x14A4
I pull Saki away from the doctor.%K%P

0x14B0
Saki「Makoto-kun...!」%K%P

0x14BC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x14C8
Even... Even I want to yell at him.%K%N

0x14D4
I can't forgive someone who just simply says, "Haruka will%Ndie."%K%P

0x14E0
But... What would that accomplish!?%K%N

0x14EC
Even if we did, Haruka will still...%K%P

0x1508
Saki「... Why... Why... Haruka...?」%K%P

0x1514
Saki「Even though... even though we might have finally%Nunderstood each other...」%K%P

0x1520
Saki approaches Haruka, and falls to her knees.%K%N

0x152C
Haruka's chest is furiously rising up and down.%K%N

0x1538
She's suffering...%K%P

0x1560
%W%W%WDespair... All I can feel is a sense of despair that's%Nbreaking me apart...%K%P

0x156C
I can't save her...%K Haruka can no longer be saved...%K%P

0x1578
Everything before my eyes begins to crumble into very%Nsmall pieces...%K%N

0x1584
They're crumbling apart just like a sand castle...%K%P

0x1590
Saki「... I-I'll go call them... I'll go call everyone...!」%K%P

0x15E4
With those words, Saki runs out of the sickroom...%K%PShe's covering her hand with her mouth... It seems like she's%Ntrying desperately not to burst out into loud sobs...%K%P

0x160C
The doctor, who sees off Saki, also silently leaves the%Nsickroom...%K%P

0x1618
I also see the driver of the car standing in front of the%Nsickroom with a worried expression as the doctor tries%Nto convince him to leave.%K%P

0x1624
Only Haruka and I... are left in the sickroom.%K%P

0x1668
The seconds hand of the clock hanging in the sickroom...%Nvacantly marks the passage of time.%K%P

0x1674
Time is such a harsh mistress... It passes away%Nheartlessly without sympathy...%K%P

0x168C
Before I know it, I'm kneeling down by Haruka's side.%K%PHaruka's palms are balled into tight fists.%K%PShe must be suffering. She must be in pain. She must be so%Nscared...%K%P

0x1698
I touch Haruka's hand.%K%P

0x16A4
Haruka, who was energetic just a few hours ago... Haruka,%Nwho was smiling just hours ago... Haruka, who was looking%Nat me just a few hours ago...%K%P

0x16C8
At that moment, Haruka's eyes suddenly open.%K%P

0x16D4
Makoto「...!」%K%P

0x16E0
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0x16EC
Haruka's eyes are blank.%K She stares into space, not%Nnoticing me.%K%P

0x16F8
Makoto「I'm right here... Haruka...」%K%P

0x1704
I grasp Haruka's hand.%K I grasp it strongly, stronger than%Never before, hoping that she'll notice my existence...%K%P

0x1710
Haruka「That hurts...」%K%P

0x171C
She says this in a weak voice. I frantically lessen the%Npower of my grip.%K%P

0x1728
Makoto「S-Sorry...」%K%P

0x1734
Haruka「No, don't be...」%K%P

0x1740
She continues staring into space. She might not even%Nhave the power to turn her own head...%K%P

0x1768
Makoto「Haruka... Haruka... I... I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0x1774
Guh. A thick sound comes from inside my chest. My voice%Nhas become tearful, bursting out of me like water%Ngushing from a dam.%K%P

0x1780
Makoto「I don't want that. I couldn't bear it...」%K%P

0x178C
Haruka「... It's all right, Makoto.」%K%P

0x1798
Haruka「... I'm just someone's replacement, so... even if I die, no%None will be hurt by it...」%K%P

0x17A4
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x17B0
Makoto「... You're wrong! ... You're not a substitute for anyone!」%K%P

0x17BC
Haruka「I'm sorry, Makoto... I'm a little tired... I guess we shouldn't%Nhave gone on that evening stroll after all...」%K%P

0x17C8
Makoto「... Wh-What are you saying, Haruka!?」%K%P

0x17D4
Haruka「I've got to sleep... Yuka's going to scold me for this%Ntomorrow...」%K%P

0x17F0
Her eyes slowly begin to close...%K%P

0x17FC
No... Wait... Wait... Haruka...%K%P

0x1808
Haruka「I'm going to sleep now, okay...? Good... night...」%K%P

0x181C
