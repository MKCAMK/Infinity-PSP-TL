And now... I am standing on Moon Beach.%K%P

0xB4
I decided to tell the others go ahead, giving them this%Nvague excuse.%K%P

0xC0
Makoto「There's something I want to think about...」%K%P

0xCC
When I told everyone that, Yuka...%K%P

0xE0
Yuka「Huh? Could it be about that 'experiment'?」%K%P

0xF4
Yuka「Geez, even if you think about it, there's nothing to be%Ngained, right!?」%K%P

0x100
Yuka「It's true that we were completely caught up in the%N'experiment'...」%K%P

0x10C
Yuka「But in the end, it was suspended, so you need to just%Nthink positive about the whole thing!」%K%P

0x120
... It seems that Yuka heard about the "experiment" from%NOkuhiko.%K%P

0x12C
According to her, when Izumi-san and I were talking in%Nthat scrap heap of a car, Okuhiko apparently explained%Nthe "experiment" to everyone.%K%P

0x138
With this, there are no secrets between the seven of us.%K%P

0x144
No, that's not quite right, is it?.%K%P

0x150
After all, Izumi-san and I are keeping the time travel a%Nsecret...%K%P

0x15C
...%K%P

0x168
Well, anyway, that's all there is to it...%K%P

0x174
Yuka, Haruka, and Okuhiko went back to the lodge, while%NSaki returned to her summer house.%K%P

0x180
All that's left on Moon Beach is my objective... That's%Nright...%K%P

0x18C
―The bell that I'm looking for.%K%P

0x198
I don't know if the bell is directly connected to the tragic%Nend Izumi-san and I reached and the time travel or not...%K%P

0x1A4
I don't know, but at the very least, if the bell isn't there,%Nthen the exact same history won't be able to repeat%Nitself.%K%P

0x1B0
(That's why I'll...)%K%P

0x1C8
Makoto「Ah...」%K%P

0x1D4
Makoto「Found it.」%K%P

0x1E0
While thinking, I quickly find the bell.%K%P

0x1EC
It's on the sand, wet from the waves... A shining, cold light.%K%P

0x1F8
I pick up the bell, and head towards the coastline road.%K%P

0x274
As I walk down the asphalt road bathed in the moonlight...%NI look for a moderately sized stone.%K%P

0x280
(So I'll...)%K%P

0x28C
(Consign this bell...)%K%P

0x298
(To oblivion!)%K%P

0x2A4
(So that it'll never appear before me... ever again...)%K%P

0x2B0
I see a fragment of concrete a few feet away from where%NI'm walking.%K%P

0x2BC
It's large and heavy enough to smash the bell.%K%P

0x2C8
I place the bell in my hand on the asphalt, pick up the%Nfragment of concrete, and with all my strength...%K%P

0x2D4
―I strike the bell from above!%K%P

0x2E0
―WHAM!!%K%P

0x2EC
In the silent night, only the grave sound of the stone%Ncolliding with something echoes.%K%P

0x2F8
(The bell has probably been smashed to pieces.)%K%P

0x304
As I think this, I turn over the fragment of concrete.%K%P

0x310
When I do...%K%P

0x32C
―It... It's gone!!!%K%P

0x338
(... The bell... is gone...)%K%P

0x344
I don't know how, but the bell has disappeared without a%Ntrace.%K%P

0x350
If there's no smashed up wreckage of the bell on the%Nground, then there might be pieces of it stuck to the%Nother side of the stone.%K%P

0x35C
But even there, there's not even a single trace of%Ndebris to be found...%K%P

0x368
Makoto「Why...?」%K%P

0x374
The only thing I can see on the cold asphalt is the%Nvague image of my shadow, cast by the pale moonlight...%K%P
