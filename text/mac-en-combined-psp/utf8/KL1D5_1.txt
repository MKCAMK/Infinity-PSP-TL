Suddenly... I wake up.%K%P

0x140
It's not that I had a nightmare, or heard a loud sound.%K%P

0x14C
I just somehow woke up for no reason...%K%P

0x158
I take a look at my watch, which I'd placed on my bedside.%K%P

0x164
"2:20 A.M."%K%P

0x170
It hasn't even been an hour since I went to sleep.%K%P

0x17C
But I don't feel sleepy at all.%K%P

0x188
My mind is surprisingly wide awake, so I try to do%Nmultiplication tables in my mind to help me go back to%Nsleep.%K%P

0x194
I try this countless times...%K%P

0x1A0
It's no use- I'm too alert.%K%P

0x1AC
I give up and get out of bed.%K%P

0x1B8
I'm sure that there's several leftover beer cans from%Ntoday in the fridge.%K%P

0x1C4
After drinking a can, my sleepiness will surely return.%K%P

0x1D0
With that thought, I quietly open the door to my room...%K%P

0x24C
Of course, there's no one in the living room.%K%P

0x258
I let out a sigh in the quiet, empty room.%K%P

0x264
I can hear Okuhiko snoring from up in the loft.%K%P

0x270
Then, all of the sudden...%K%P

0x27C
Okuhiko「Hey! Wait!」%K%P

0x288
... Okuhiko suddenly shouts in a roaring voice.%K%N

0x294
When I look up in surprise...%K%P

0x310
Okuhiko「This is bad... I... don't have... enough... energy...... Zzz...」%K%P

0x324
Okuhiko「Neutrino Energy, Power On! ... Trans〜form! ... There! ...%NZzz...」%K%P

0x338
Okuhiko「You've shown yourself, Mysterious Hi-Tech Vacuum%NCleaner Man... Ugh... He's... sucking... me in... ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x34C
Okuhiko「Good work... Zzz...」%K%P

0x360
Okuhiko「Hey! ... Kid! ... Get off of the stage! ... Hey, stop it! ... Don't...%Nlower... that zipper! ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x374
... It seems he's just sleeptalking.%K%P

0x380
(Whew... Man, what kind of dream is he having anyway...?)%K%P

0x38C
I sigh as I open the fridge.%K%P

0x3B4
... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp...%K%P

0x3C0
Makoto「Whew... that's good stuff there...」%K%P

0x3CC
Huh? That old geezer-esque expression sounds like%Nsomething Yuka would say, not me...%K%P

0x3D8
Better watch myself...%K%P

0x3E4
... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp... Gulp.%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「Man... that was good...」%K%P

0x3FC
I drink the beer up in one gulp.%K%P

0x408
I place the empty can on the round table with a clunk.%K%P

0x414
Suddenly, I feel intoxicated.%K%P

0x420
It's a really pleasant feeling.%K%P

0x42C
Although it's not like there's anything I really want to do, I%Ncasually decide to try going outside the lodge.%K%P

0x4B4
Suddenly, I look up at the sky.%K%P

0x4C0
Haah... I take a deep breath.%K%P

0x4CC
Up until now, I've never seen a starry sky as marvelous%Nas this one.%K%P

0x4E0
I'm bathed in a pool of serene starlight.%K%P

0x4EC
The twinkling stars shine brightly as they appear to%Ndance.%K%P

0x4F8
In the bewitching dark blue sky, I can even see the%Ncomplete flickering of nebulas.%K%P

0x504
Makoto「Ahh...」%K%P

0x510
I let out an awed sigh.%K%P

0x51C
The endlessly vast space... that's where the eternal flow%Nof time lies.%K%P

0x528
I realize the extreme tininess of my own existence.%K%P

0x534
I feel a bit embarrassed.%K%P

0x540
But at the same time, I can't help feeling a trembling%Nsense of ecstasy.%K%P

0x54C
The galaxy... the light of Milky Way's flow is more beautiful%Nthan anything in this world.%K%P

0x558
I begin to start unconsciously staggering towards the%Nlight, as if it's beckoning me.%K%P

0x598
I bet that if I keep on going down the hill and head%Nstraight towards the ocean, I might be able to touch it.%K%P

0x5A4
No matter how far I go, though, the light is always out of%Nmy reach.%K%P

0x5B0
I get annoyed and quicken my pace.%K%P

0x5BC
Sometimes, I try to reach out for the stars.%K%P

0x5C8
They don't respond.%K%P

0x5D4
Instead, they seem to run across the sky, away from me.%K%P

0x62C
When I come to my senses, I'm walking on Moon Beach.%K%P

0x638
I still can't catch the light.%K%P

0x644
Standing on top of the sand, I try to jump up with all my%Nmight, reaching out as far as I can.%K%P

0x650
Just a little further...%K%P

0x65C
I'll try jumping one more time.%K%P

0x668
I jump again... and again... and again...%K%P

0x674
Even I know that I'm drunk.%K%P

0x680
It's because I'm tipsy that I'm acting like such a dumbass.%K%P

0x68C
I'll try jumping one more time... and again... and again.%K%N

0x6A8
...???%K%P

0x6B4
As I attempt to catch the stars, I see someone out of%Nthe corner of my eyes.%K%P

0x6C0
On the roof of Lunabeach... someone is sitting down,%Nhugging their knees...%K%P

0x6CC
It's Kurumi...%K%P

0x6D8
Makoto「Heeeey, Kurumiiii! What're you doing outside in the middle%Nof the night?」%K%P

0x700
Kurumi「... the sea...」%K%P

0x70C
Makoto「Huh!? I can't hear you!」%K%P

0x718
Kurumi「Kurumi's looking at the sea...」%K%P

0x724
Makoto「I see, I see...」%K%P

0x730
Makoto「Can I come over there too?」%K%P

0x73C
Kurumi nods from the top of the roof.%K%P

0x748
Makoto「Then wait! I'll be there soon!」%K%P

0x780
Fortunately, the door to Lunabeach is unlocked.%K%P

0x78C
... No, "carelessly" seems to be a more apt term.%K%P

0x798
I muse over this as I walk upstairs to the second floor.%K%P

0x7A4
In that small room, I can hear Izumi-san breathing in her%Nsleep.%K%P

0x7B0
I stealthily open the window on the ceiling and climb up%Nso that I don't wake her.%K%P

0x7BC
...%K%P

0x7C8
The top of the roof feels much higher than I thought it%Nwas when I saw it from below.%K%P

0x7D4
As I grip onto the roof with both of my hands, I move to%Nthe timid Kurumi, and sit down beside her.%K%P

0x7E8
Even though the stars are so pretty, Kurumi isn't looking%Nat them, but rather, the vast ocean.%K%P

0x7F4
There's a trace of loneliness in her gaze...%K%P

0x800
Yes... her eyes look the same as they did when I saw her%Nthat one time at Viewpoint Park...%K%P

0x80C
Makoto「Kurumi... you said you were looking at the ocean, didn't%Nyou?」%K%P

0x818
Kurumi「... Yes.」%K%P

0x824
Makoto「But the ocean's pitch black, so you can't see anything,%Nright?」%K%P

0x830
Kurumi「... You can.」%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「Then what can you see?」%K%P

0x848
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x854
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x870
Just then, all of the sudden...%K%P

0x8A8
Kurumi「Do you know why the ocean's water is so salty?」%K%P

0x8B4
... Kurumi asks me this question.%K

0xEE8
Yeah.

0xEF4
No.

0x8F4
Makoto「Yeah, I know.」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「The rock salt on mountains were dissolved by rain water,%Nand were carried to the seas by rivers that flowed to%Nthem. It then accumulated over billions of years, so as a-」%K%P

0x914
Makoto「No... I don't know.」%K%P

0x920
Kurumi「The ocean's water...」%K%P

0x92C
Kurumi「The ocean's water is the moon's tears. That's why it's so%Nsalty...」%K%P

0x938
Kurumi「Because the moon was all alone, it was lonely, and would%Ncry during the night. 'Sob, sob... sob, sob'...」%K%P

0x944
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x950
Kurumi「Even so, the moon was still lonely, and so its tears gave%Nbirth to children. A lot of children...」%K%P

0x95C
Kurumi「The child of the moon and the sea, the jellyfish...」%K%P

0x968
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x974
Kurumi「Kurumi was looking at the jellyfish.」%K%P

0x980
Makoto「Jellyfish...?」%K%P

0x98C
I try looking out at the vast, pitch black sea, but I can't%Nsee anything.%K%P

0x998
Kurumi「Kurumi wants to be like a jellyfish...」%K%P

0x9A4
Kurumi「Just gently floating in the sea from day to night... if she%Nlived like that, she'd be happy...」%K%P

0x9B0
She appears to be deep in thought as she broods over%Nthis...%K%P

0x9BC
Does Kurumi have some kind of worries?%K%P

0x9C8
Secrets she can't tell anyone...%K%P

0x9D4
Secrets...?%K%P

0x9E0
In that instant, a flash runs through my mind.%K%P

0x9EC
Probably because I was drunk... I completely forgot%NKurumi's secret...%K%P

0x9F8
Izumi「... Kurumi... might not be my real sister...」%K%P

0xA04
Judging from the way Izumi-san said that... and from how%Nfrantic she got when Kurumi appeared, I don't think that%NKurumi knows this.%K%P

0xA10
Then what is Kurumi thinking about now...?%K%P

0xA1C
Kurumi「Did you know? Kurumi loves floating in the water... Like a%Njellyfish...」%K%P

0xA28
Kurumi「When she does that, it feels kinda nostalgic...」%K%P

0xA34
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA40
Kurumi「The truth is... Kurumi... really wanted to go with everyone...」%K%P

0xA4C
Kurumi「To the pool... and the hot springs...」%K%P

0xA58
Makoto「Well, if you wanted to, then why didn't you? It's okay, isn't%Nit...?」%K%P

0xA64
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xA70
Kurumi casts her eyes downwards.%K%P

0xA7C
She gently brushes the smooth, polished blue roof with%Nher palm...%K%P

0xA88
Kurumi「She was scared...」%K%P

0xA94
She mutters this in a lonely voice.%K%P

0xAA0
Kurumi「She was scared everyone would hate her...」%K%P

0xAAC
Hate???%K%P

0xAB8
Kurumi「There's a scar... on Kurumi's back.」%K%P

0xAC4
Kurumi「It's a deep scar... that looks as if it were cut and gouged%Nout by a saw...」%K%P

0xAD0
Kurumi「The doctors said she got it when Kurumi was a baby... in%Naddition to that, they say it probably happened shortly%Nafter she was born.」%K%P

0xADC
Kurumi「But you know what? Papa, Mama, and Onee-chan are%Nlying to Kurumi.」%K%P

0xAE8
Kurumi「They told Kurumi that she got that scar when she fell%Ndown the stairs when she was three.」%K%P

0xAF4
Kurumi「Even though no matter how you look at it, there's no way%NKurumi could have gotten that scar... from falling down%Nthe stairs...」%K%P

0xB00
I don't say anything. I don't know what I should say.%K%P

0xB0C
After hearing Kurumi's unexpected confession, all I can%Ndo is silently listen to her story.%K%P

0xB18
Kurumi「And you know what else? This scar... has given Kurumi%Nquite a few painful memories...」%K%P

0xB24
Kurumi「In middle school... there was this boy Kurumi was into...」%K%P

0xB30
Kurumi「He was a senpai older than Kurumi, but... whether it was%Nstudying or playing, he taught Kurumi several things...」%K%P

0xB3C
Kurumi「Every day, when school ended, we would stop by this%Nnearby park, and chat about trivial things...」%K%P

0xB48
Kurumi「Even though it was just trivial chat, to Kurumi, those were%Nprecious times. Very... precious...」%K%P

0xB54
Kurumi「Kurumi... loved... that senpai...」%K%P

0xB60
Kurumi「But you know what? One day, that senpai... stopped%Ntalking to Kurumi... He wouldn't say a single word to her...」%K%P

0xB6C
Kurumi「He wouldn't even exchange glances with her when we%Npassed in the hallways...」%K%P

0xB78
Kurumi「After school... Kurumi was all alone at the park, swinging%Non the swing...」%K%P

0xB84
Kurumi「She stayed there until night... alone all that whole time...%Nswinging away... swinging away...」%K%P

0xB90
Kurumi「Kurumi heard the reason why that senpai stopped talk%Nto her from her friends later...」%K%P

0xB9C
... ...%K%P

0xBA8
Senpai「That girl's got this giant scar on her back!」%K%P

0xBB4
Senpai「I dunno know how she got it, but... At any rate, I'm%Ncompletely through with her.」%K%P

0xBC0
Senpai「There's no way in hell I can go with her to the beach with%Nthat disgusting scar! It'd be way too embarrassing...」%K%P

0xBCC
Senpai「Yes, that's right. That's why I'm ignoring her!」%K%P

0xBD8
Senpai「She's nothing more than a nuisance to me at this point!」%K%P

0xBE4
... ...%K%P

0xBF0
Kurumi「To be honest... it was a great shock...」%K%P

0xBFC
Kurumi「It left a scar on Kurumi much deeper than the one on her%Nback...」%K%P

0xC08
Kurumi「Ever since then, Kurumi's been afraid to show her back in%Nfront of other people...」%K%P

0xC14
Kurumi「Yes... That's the reason... why Kurumi didn't go to the pool%Nand hot springs with everyone else...」%K%P

0xC20
I'm incredibly angry. So angry that my body is shaking%Nfrom it.%K%P

0xC2C
I want to drag that senpai here and beat the living shit%Nout of him.%K%P

0xC38
I want to kick him until his bones break, and throw him to%Nthe bottom of the sea...%K%P

0xC44
Without realizing it, I clench my hands into tight fists.%K%P

0xC58
Kurumi「Up until now... Kurumi's never told anyone about this...」%K%P

0xC64
Kurumi「And Kurumi thinks she probably won't tell it to anyone%Nafter this...」%K%P

0xC70
Kurumi「You're the only one who knows this, Onii-chan...」%K%P

0xC7C
Kurumi「Kurumi only told you because you're Onii-chan.」%K%P

0xC88
Kurumi「... So don't... tell anyone else...」%K%P

0xCF0
... After that, I am unable to say almost anything to Kurumi.%K%P

0xCFC
I feel that even if I try to comfort her about the scar,%Nanything I say will sound half-hearted to her.%K%P

0xD08
In the end, only Kurumi knows her own pain...%K%P

0xD14
...%K%P

0xD20
It's clear that Kurumi's emotional scars still haven't%Nhealed yet.%K%P

0xD2C
But what can I do about it?%K%P

0xD38
Speaking words of kindness to her... anyone could do%Nthat.%K%P

0xD44
I'm sure if many people heard this story, a lot of them%Nwould try to gently comfort Kurumi.%K%P

0xD50
Even so, that wouldn't eliminate Kurumi's scar.%K%P

0xD5C
It's not something that easy to cure...%K%P

0xD68
Then what should I do?%K%P

0xD74
My mind is in extreme chaos.%K%P

0xD80
I'm thinking about way too much right now...%K%P

0xD8C
Izumi-san's story is still lurking in my heart as well.%K%P

0xD98
—The shrine. —The kidnapping. —The possibility%Nthat they may not be real sisters.%K%P

0xDA4
—And the scar on her back...%K%P

0xDB0
Tomorrow, I'll ask Izumi-san to continue her story.%K%P

0xDBC
That story might have some connection to the scar on%Nher back.%K%P

0xDC8
The unbearably long night goes on...%K%P
