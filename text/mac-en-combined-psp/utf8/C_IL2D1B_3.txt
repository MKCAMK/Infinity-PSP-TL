I sit in the car's passenger seat.%K%P

0x58
From beyond the glass windshield, I can see the white%Nwalls of Lunabeach.%K%P

0x64
Izumi-san is sitting in the driver's seat, looking at me%Nuneasily.%K%P

0x70
Izumi「Makoto-kun... are you all right?」%K%P

0x7C
Makoto「Of course... I'm not...」%K%P

0x88
Makoto「I don't understand anything anymore...」%K%P

0x94
Makoto「Since this happened... it feels like I'm about to go insane%Nat any moment...」%K%P

0xA0
When she hears my words, Izumi-san tightly purses her%Nlips, and lowers her gaze.%K%P

0xAC
Izumi「I'm so sorry...」%K%P

0xB8
Izumi「I should... have told you sooner...」%K%P

0xC4
Makoto「It's... fine...」%K%P

Makoto「I don't want to hear your excuses...」%K%P

Izumi「...」%K%P

0xE8
Makoto「I want to hear... everything...」%K%P

0xF4
Makoto「I want to hear everything you know, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x100
Izumi-san closes her eyes.%K%P

0x10C
While her lips quiver...%K%P

0x118
Izumi「... Yes... I understand...」%K%P

0x124
... she mutters this.%K%P

0x130
She slowly opens her eyes, with the light dancing in her%Npupils.%K%P

0x13C
As I do everything I can to endure waiting, Izumi-san%Nquietly begins talking...%K%P

0x158
Izumi「The one who told...」%K%P

0x164
Izumi「... Okuhiko-kun...」%K%P

0x170
Izumi「... to deceive you, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x18C
Izumi「... was me.」%K%P

0x1B4
Makoto「!? W-Why... did you do that!?」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi「Because I wanted to understand it...」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「Understand what!?」%K%P

0x1D8
Izumi「Cur▲ Syndrome.」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「... Cur▲... Syndrome?」%K%P

0x1F0
(It feels like... I've heard that somewhere before...)%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「That's right! Okuhiko!」%K%P

0x208
Makoto「The title of the report Okuhiko had...」%K%P

0x214
Makoto「It was 'Cur▲ Syndrome Inquiry'.」%K%P

0x220
Izumi「... Makoto-kun... did you read that report?」%K%P

0x22C
Makoto「No, not really. I just randomly flipped through it...」%K%P

0x238
Izumi「I... I see...」%K%P

0x244
Makoto「But Izumi-san, why do you know about the report?」%K%P

0x250
Izumi「Because...」%K%P

0x25C
Izumi「I was the one who wrote it...」%K%P

0x268
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x274
Izumi「I handed it over to Okuhiko-kun...」%K%P

0x280
Makoto「W-Wait a minute, Izumi-san.」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「So when Okuhiko said 'Professor' earlier, he meant...」%K%P

0x298
Izumi「That's right...」%K%P

0x2A4
Izumi「I'm a professor at your college, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x2B0
Izumi「The one in charge of the Kawashima Party Seminar... is me.」%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2C8
Izumi「But even though I'm telling you this...」%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi「This doesn't clear up much for you, does it?」%K%P

0x2E0
I'm so stunned by the revelation that I'm unable to even%Nnod.%K%P

0x2EC
I can't even move an inch on this hard seat.%K%P

0x314
Izumi「Then I'll explain things from the start, one by one...」%K%P

0x320
Izumi「First, about Cur▲ Syndrome.」%K%P

0x32C
Izumi「It's been several years since these words first started%Nto be used.」%K%P

0x338
Izumi「An American psychiatrist named 'Michael Cabin'%Ndiscovered a certain mental illness with unique%Nsymptoms.」%K%P

0x344
Izumi「At the same time, Dr. Cabin participated in the counseling%Nof a boy named 'Tom Faiblin', who was hospitalized at the%Nhospital he worked at.」%K%P

0x350
Izumi「Tom was still twelve years old at the time, but he had%Nbeen diagnosed with paranoia.」%K%P

0x35C
Makoto「... Paranoia?」%K%P

0x368
Izumi「Yes, that's right, paranoia... In other words, he was%Ndelusional.」%K%P

0x374
Izumi「His symptoms first appeared when he was 10.」%K%P

0x380
Izumi「He was a straight-A student, had a good personality,%Nand was a child who was adored by everyone...」%K%P

0x38C
Izumi「... Then, when he was 10, in the summer of 2003...」%K%P

0x398
Izumi「Suddenly he began saying incoherent, illogical things.」%K%P

0x3C0
"I have no 'death' in me."%K%P

0x3CC
"That's why I won't 'die'."%K%P

0x3D8
"I won't die because I can't die."%K%P

0x3E4
"... I'll live forever..."%K%P

0x3F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3FC
"Anyone who touches me will also become immortal."%K%P

0x408
"By infecting others with immortality through this%NImmortality Contagion, death will soon disappear from the%Nworld."%K%P

0x414
"No one will die... They can't die anymore..."%K%P

0x420
"... They'll live for eternity..."%K%P

0x42C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x438
Izumi「Makoto-kun, do you know about Pseudologia%NFantastica?」%K%P

0x444
Izumi「It's also called 'Mythomania'...」%K%P

0x450
Makoto「Ah... now that you mention it...」%K%P

0x45C
Makoto「I think that something like that was written in that file...」%K%P

0x468
Izumi「Then I'll just give you an abridged explanation...」%K%P

0x474
Izumi「In short... 'The liar themself is completely convinced that%Nthat lie was a real event.'」%K%P

0x480
Izumi「That's what's known as 'Mythomania'.」%K%P

0x48C
Izumi「It was the same in Tom's case as well.」%K%P

0x498
Makoto「I get it!」%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「In other words, at first, Tom was aware that he was lying.」%K%P

0x4B0
Makoto「But as he continued to keep saying things like 'I won't%Ndie, and neither will anyone else'...」%K%P

0x4BC
Makoto「He reached the point where he truly believed that he%Ncouldn't die and possessed the power of immortality,%Nright?」%K%P

0x4C8
Izumi「Yes, that's right... At least, that's what it seemed like at%Nfirst...」%K%P

0x4D4
Makoto「'Seemed'?」%K%P

0x4E0
Izumi「The people around him and the psychiatrists also%Nthought that at first, but...」%K%P

0x4EC
Izumi「Before long, they realized that it wasn't merely%N'Mythomania'.」%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x504
Izumi「The first one to suggest that was Dr. Cabin.」%K%P

0x510
Izumi「As Dr. Cabin's counseling progressed, he located the%N'real trigger' that made Tom reach the point where he%Nbegan to embrace those delusions.」%K%P

0x51C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x528
Izumi「His conclusion was that said trigger was...」%K%P

0x534
Izumi「'When Tom actually saved his sister's life'... That was it.」%K%P

0x540
Izumi「In the summer of 2003, when he was 10...」%K%P

0x54C
Izumi「His family went camping by a lake, in which his 7 year old%Nsister fell in and sank.」%K%P

0x558
Izumi「Tom dived into the lake, and carried his sister back to%Nshore.」%K%P

0x564
Izumi「But his sister had stopped breathing, and she had no%Npulse...」%K%P

0x570
Izumi「In other words, she was on the verge of death.」%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「Yet in spite of that, he miraculously saved his sister?」%K%P

0x588
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x594
Makoto「If that's the case, then what Tom said is true, isn't it?」%K%P

0x5A0
Makoto「Because he touched her... she was saved...」%K%P

0x5AC
Izumi「No. That's wrong.」%K%P

0x5B8
Izumi「He had simply seen on TV how to perform first aid%Ntreatment, and merely repeated what he had seen.」%K%P

0x5C4
Izumi「... He used artificial respiration... and gave her a cardiac%Nmassage...」%K%P

0x5D0
Izumi「As a result, he was successful in saving her life... that's%Nall there was to it.」%K%P

0x5DC
Izumi「Tom possessing an immortal body... or that he infected%Nhis sister with immortality... That's impossible.」%K%P

0x5E8
Izumi「But you know what...?」%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi「There were also some people who didn't think that way.」%K%P

0x600
Makoto「... Such as?」%K%P

0x60C
Izumi「His parents and his sister.」%K%P

0x618
Izumi「They were truly convinced that a miracle had occurred.」%K%P

0x624
"Tom, you're able to bring dead people back to life!"%K%P

0x630
"Big brother, you have a marvelous power that makes%Nmiracles happen!"%K%P

0x63C
Izumi「Every day, they would turn to Tom and keep saying this.」%K%P

0x648
Izumi「Their utmost and heartfelt praise filled him with a sense%Nof reverence.」%K%P

0x654
Makoto「So that was... the trigger...」%K%P

0x660
Makoto「Anyone would turn out like that.%K If the people around%Nthem kept telling them that something was 'black' over%Nand over again, even if that thing were actually 'white', it%Nwould seem 'black' to that person.」%K%P

0x66C
Makoto「In Tom's case, it was 'Tom possesses a marvelous%Npower... Tom possesses a marvelous power'...」%K%P

0x678
Makoto「Because his trusted family kept saying that every day,%Nhe completely reached the point where he embraced%Nwild delusions... So that's what happened.」%K%P

0x684
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x690
Izumi「Of course, it would be wrong to say that the main cause%Nwasn't mental...」%K%P

0x69C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x6A8
Izumi「10 is the approximate age where you reach the point%Nthat you finally understand the meaning of 'death'...」%K%P

0x6B4
Izumi「You feel very sensitive towards 'death', and do things%Nsuch as embracing excessive fear and feelings of%Ndespair.」%K%P

0x6C0
Izumi「In short, there was something like a fear towards 'death'%Nin Tom's mind from the start...」%K%P

0x6CC
Izumi「That, plus the lake incident and his family's words...」%K%P

0x6D8
Izumi「That's why Tom reached the point where he firmly%Nbelieved things such as 'I won't die' and 'I can infect%Nothers with immortality'...」%K%P

0x6E4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x6F0
Izumi「Tom himself called this 'act of infecting other with%Nimmortality,' 'Cure'.」%K%P

0x6FC
Izumi「'Cure'... as you know, that means 'to heal'.」%K%P

0x708
Izumi「And so Dr. Cabin named this unique type of paranoia%N'Cur▲ Syndrome'.」%K%P

0x714
Izumi「While Tom used the English word 'Cure' to refer to his%Nability, Dr. Cabin used the French word 'Cur▲' for Cur▲%NSyndrome.」%K%P

0x720
(The French word...?)%K%P

0x72C
(Why didn't he just stick with the English word...?)%K%P

0x738
Izumi「Anyway, Cur▲ Syndrome is...」%K%P

0x744
Izumi「The definition of the act of firmly believing, without a%Ndoubt, that the lies told by people surrounding you are%Nthe truth.」%K%P

0x750
Izumi「At this time, it's important that 'The first person or people%Nwho lied also don't think it's a lie.'」%K%P

0x75C
Izumi「The person who reached the point where they%Nembraced the delusion and the first person or people%Nwho lied are convinced the lie is 'reality' and 'the truth'...」%K%P

0x768
Izumi「They seriously believe it from the bottom of their hearts.」%K%P

0x774
Izumi「In a sense, you might say that's the 'spreading of the%Ndelusion'.」%K%P

0x780
Izumi「These are the two principle traits of Cur▲ Syndrome.」%K%P

0x7C4
Izumi-san takes a deep breath.%K%P

0x7D0
Her expression seems to have calmed down a little.%K%P

0x7DC
Maybe the more she slowly reveals the truth to me, the%Nlighter the weight in her heart gets.%K%P

0x7E8
Suddenly, outside the window, I see...%K%P

0x83C
... Saki.%K%P

0x854
Saki forcefully opens the door to Lunabeach, and%Nlunges in.%K%P

0x860
(I see...)%K%P

0x86C
(She's here to complain about her pizza...)%K%P

0x888
Izumi-san also seems to realize this.%K%P

0x894
But we don't have time to deal with Saki right now.%K%P

0x8A0
She's not even close to done with explaining%Neverything...%K%P

0x8AC
With the exception of Cur▲ Syndrome... I still know%Nnothing...%K%P

0x8D4
Makoto「Izumi-san, earlier, you said 'Because I wanted to%Nunderstand it', right?」%K%P

0x8E0
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x8EC
Makoto「You wanted to understand Cur▲ Syndrome... That's why%Nyou told Okuhiko to deceive me...」%K%P

0x8F8
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x904
Makoto「I see... so that's it...」%K%P

0x910
Makoto「I finally understand, Izumi-san.」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「What Okuhiko meant earlier...」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「... When he said 'experiment'.」%K%P

0x934
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「In short, this Seminar Camp's goal was 'To run an%Nexperiment on Cur▲ Syndrome'.」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「... Is that right, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x958
Izumi-san gives me a slow, deep nod.%K%P

0x964
Makoto「Judging from the way he talked earlier, it seems like only%Nyou and him are involved with the experiment...」%K%P

0x970
Makoto「Then the others...」%K%P

0x97C
Izumi「Right. They haven't been told anything about this%Nexperiment.」%K%P

0x988
Izumi「Not Yuka-chan, not Haruka-chan... and of course, not%NKurumi.」%K%P

0x994
Izumi「The only thing those three knew was that I was a%Nprofessor.」%K%P

0x9A0
Izumi「But I told them in advance that they weren't allowed to%Ntell you anything.」%K%P

0x9AC
Izumi「'The goal of this Seminar Camp is to deepen the amity%Nbetween the members.'」%K%P

0x9B8
Izumi「'At the same time, it's also serving as a background%Ncheck for Makoto-kun, who has a low attendance rate.」%K%P

0x9C4
Izumi「... That's the excuse I used.」%K%P

0x9D0
Makoto「Then... what about Saki?」%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「Does Saki know about the experiment?」%K%P

0x9E8
Izumi「No...」%K%P

0x9F4
Izumi「Saki-chan's involvement was completely unexpected...」%K%P

0xA00
Izumi「She definitely doesn't even know that I'm a professor...」%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「Which means that it really is only you and Okuhiko...」%K%P

0xA18
Makoto「But... why didn't you just tell them as well...?」%K%P

0xA24
Izumi「Because there was no need to.」%K%P

0xA30
Izumi「The more people there were who knew the truth, the%Ngreater the danger there was of the secret slipping%Nout... That's why.」%K%P

0xA3C
Makoto「... I see.」%K%P

0xA48
Makoto「Only two people, that is, you and Okuhiko, were sufficient%Nenough to deceive me... That's what you mean...」%K%P

0xA54
The words I spit out create an anguished expression on%NIzumi-san's face.%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「Well, whatever.」%K%P

0xA6C
Makoto「Over-the-top conspiracies aren't exactly my thing%Nanyway...」%K%P

0xA78
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xA84
Makoto「Anyway, by you and Okuhiko pretending that my%Npremonitions were actually correct...」%K%P

0xA90
Makoto「... you tried to make me firmly believe that 'I have%Nprecognition'.」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「In other words, you intentionally tried to make me%Nembrace my 'delusion'.」%K%P

0xAA8
Makoto「You attempt to cause me to be afflicted with 'Cur▲%NSyndrome', just like Tom...」%K%P

0xAB4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xAC0
Makoto「And... you secretly observed me every day as my state%Nbegan to change...」%K%P

0xACC
Makoto「You were investigating the process of your subject's%Npsychological change...」%K%P

0xAD8
Makoto「That's the true goal of this Seminar Camp... All to carry%Nout this so-called 'experiment'.」%K%P

0xAE4
Makoto「... Isn't that right?」%K%P

0xAF0
Izumi-san is silent.%K%P

0xAFC
She lowers her eyes, trying to avoid my gaze.%K%P

0xB08
I'm just waiting for her answer.%K%P

0xB14
Before long...%K%P

0xB20
Izumi「... Yes... you're right.」%K%P

0xB2C
... Izumi-san speaks with a cracked voice.%K%P

0xB38
Izumi「But... But you know what?」%K%P

0xB44
Izumi「This might... sound like an excuse, but...」%K%P

0xB50
Izumi「We...」%K%P

0xB5C
Izumi「We never actually...」%K%P

0xB78
Izumi「... conducted our experiment.」%K%P

0xB84
Makoto「... What???」%K%P

0xB90
Izumi「It's certainly a fact that we planned to...」%K%P

0xB9C
Izumi「But so far, we've actually never deceived you!」%K%P

0xBA8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBB4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xBC0
Makoto「I-Izumi-san...」%K%P

0xBCC
Makoto「You're still lying this late in the-」%K%P

0xBD8
Izumi「I'm not lying!」%K%P

0xBE4
Izumi「It's the truth!」%K%P

0xBF0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBFC
Izumi「In reality, all the premonitions you said you had all turned%Nout to be correct!」%K%P

0xC08
Makoto「W-Why are you... saying that...?」%K%P

0xC14
Makoto「Okuhiko confessed... everything earlier, didn't he...?」%K%P

0xC20
Makoto「The rice incident, the battery incident, the dinner%Nincident...」%K%P

0xC2C
Makoto「You and Okuhiko just pretended that they were correct,%Nweren't you?」%K%P

0xC38
Izumi「Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0xC44
Izumi-san suddenly grabs my wrist.%K%P

0xC50
And like that, she drags it to the base of my feet...%K%N

0xC5C
... She makes me feel the car's key with my hand.%K%P

0xC68
Izumi「Why don't you try it?」%K%P

0xC74
Makoto「Huh? Try what?」%K%P

0xC80
Izumi「Why don't you try... starting the engine?」%K%P

0xC8C
Makoto「T-The engine?」%K%P

0xC98
Although I'm flustered and don't understand what's going%Non, I do what she says, and turn the key.%K%P

0xCCC
Izumi「Once more...」%K%P

0xD68
―Click. ―Click. ―Click.%K%P

0xD74
I turn the key countless times, but the engine no longer%Nshows any reaction.%K%P

0xD80
Izumi「It was from today's afternoon.」%K%P

0xD8C
Izumi「I also tried it once this morning, but at that time, it was%Nfunctioning normally...」%K%P

0xD98
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xDA4
Izumi「Do you... understand?」%K%P

0xDB0
Makoto「Then, at that time too...」%K%P

0xDBC
Makoto「On April 2nd too...」%K%P

0xDC8
Makoto「The engine actually wouldn't start?」%K%P

0xDD4
Izumi「Yes.」%K%P

0xDE0
Makoto「Then you weren't actually pretending that it wouldn't%Nstart...」%K%P

0xDEC
Izumi「... I wasn't.」%K%P

0xDF8
Izumi「Of course, it's the same for your other premonitions...」%K%P

0xE04
Izumi「We really didn't have enough rice at the shop...」%K%P

0xE48
Izumi「On the night of the 3rd, I really did plan on making curry,%Nand bought the ingredients for it.」%K%P

0xE5C
Izumi「On the night of the 3rd, I really did plan on making cream%Nstew, and bought the ingredients for it.」%K%P

0xE70
Izumi「On the night of the 3rd, I really did plan on making%Nmeat-potato stew, and bought the ingredients for it.」%K%P

0xE7C
Izumi「And no matter how you look at it, there's no way we could%Nhave faked the earthquake and the cards, right?」%K%P

0xE88
Makoto「If that's the case, then Okuhiko...」%K%P

0xE94
Izumi「I think he probably made a misunderstanding.」%K%P

0xEA0
Izumi「If anyone were in Okuhiko's standpoint, they definitely%Nwouldn't have thought your premonitions were actually%Ncorrect.」%K%P

0xEAC
Makoto「Hmm... so that's it...」%K%P

0xEB8
Makoto「So every time my premonitions came true, Okuhiko was%Nconvinced that you were acting.」%K%P

0xEC4
Makoto「That goes for the rice incident, the battery incident, and%Nthe dinner incident...」%K%P

0xED0
Makoto「... Wait, dinner?」%K%P

0xEDC
Makoto「Now that I think about it, at that time, didn't Okuhiko say%Nthat he prepared the ingredients himself?」%K%P

0xEE8
Izumi「Yes. It's a fact that Okuhiko-kun bought ingredients and%Ncame back.」%K%P

0xEF4
Izumi「While I was cooking, he secretly entered the kitchen...%Nand then he placed his ingredients down.」%K%P

0xF00
Izumi「But at that point, I had almost finished cooking...」%K%P

0xF0C
Makoto「So in the end, you didn't use the ingredients Okuhiko%Nbought?」%K%P

0xF18
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xF24
I see... putting it that way, that's probably how it turned%Nout.%K%P

0xF30
When I was preparing for the barbecue, I returned to the%Nlodge to get onions.%K%P

0xF3C
Now I see why there were so many onions.%K%P

0xF48
They were the ones Izumi-san didn't use, and the ones%NOkuhiko prepared.%K%P

0xF54
Both portions were put into that plastic bag.%K%P

0xF60
It seems that what Izumi-san is saying isn't a lie.%K%P

0xF6C
Makoto「And that's why you were so persistently asking me%Nabout my premonitions.」%K%P

0xF94
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xFA0
Izumi「Because even though we hadn't done anything yet...」%K%P

0xFAC
Izumi「You were still suddenly speaking of premonitions...」%K%P

0xFB8
Izumi「And furthermore, every single one of your premonitions%Nwas correct...」%K%P

0xFC4
Izumi「I... didn't understand what was what...」%K%P

0xFD0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xFDC
"In reality, all of my premonitions were correct."%K%P

0xFE8
Despite being informed of this startling fact, it doesn't%Nphase me.%K%P

0xFF4
My senses might've already gone numb from all this%Ninformation overload.%K%P
