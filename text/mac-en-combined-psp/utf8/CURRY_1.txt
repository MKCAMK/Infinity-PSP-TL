When I enter the living room, everybody is already%Ngathered.%K%P

0x60
I sit down on the sofa as everyone passes the time idly.%K%P

0x6C
There's a melancholic atmosphere as the events from%Nearlier are still lingering in our minds.%K%P

0x78
Izumi-san, Haruka, Okuhiko... even Kurumi is dead silent.%K%P

0x8C
As for Yuka... Right now, she is standing by the window,%Nfiddling with something. It isn't like her to look so lonely.%K%P

0x98
Makoto「Yuka... what's that?」%K%P

0xA4
I ask her.%K%P

0xB8
Yuka「Hmm? Ah... this?」%K%P

0xC4
Yuka「Kurumi-chan and I went to the gift shop after our tennis%Nmatch... I bought this there.」%K%P

0xD0
Yuka holds up the trinket with her fingertips to show me.%K%P

0xE4
It's a key chain.%K%N

0xF0
Attached to it is some kind of fat cat mascot character%Nthat's about as big as my palm.%K%P

0xFC
Makoto「Is that a souvenir for someone?」%K%P

0x108
Yuka「No, I bought it for myself.」%K%P

0x114
Yuka「What do you think of the Nin-Nin Neko Pyon?」%K%P

0x120
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x13C
Yuka「Its name... that's the name I gave it...」%K%P

0x148
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x154
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x160
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x174
Yuka「... You can't have it.」%K%P

0x180
Makoto「Why would I want something like that!?」%K%P

0x18C
Yuka「Hmm... Fine, then... For a moment there, you looked jealous...」%K%P

0x198
Jealous?%K%N

0x1A4
Where she got that idea from, I've got no clue.%K%P

0x1C8
... We stop talking after that...%K%P

0x1D4
Somehow, things seem to be even quieter than they%Nwere before.%K%P

0x1E0
No one tries to start a conversation...%K%N

0x1EC
Just then...%K%P

0x21C
Izumi「Well, I guess it's about time I made dinner.」%K%P

0x228
... As if attempting to break the ice, Izumi-san cheerfully%Ndeclares this as she heads towards the kitchen.%K%P

0x234
Makoto「Izumi-san, I'll help you out.」%K%P

0x240
I think I should follow her example.%K%P

0x24C
Izumi「Huh〜? It's fine. If you want to help, just set the table.」%K%P

0x258
Makoto「No way... I'll be fine!」%K%P

0x264
Makoto「At least let me help with peeling the potatoes!」%K%P

0x278
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x284
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x290
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x29C
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0x2C0
Izumi「... Potatoes?」%K%P

0x2CC
In that instant, everyone looks towards me.%K%P

0x2D8
Their glares pierce me like daggers.%K%P

0x2E4
The overwhelming, sudden pressure feels like it's%Nsuffocating me.%K%P

0x30C
(Not again...)%K%P

0x318
(Not another... premonition...)%K%P

0x324
But in contrast to my thoughts, for some reason, these%Nwords begin to float in my mind.%K

0x11D8
(We're having curry, right?)

0x11E4
(We're having cream stew, right?)

0x11F0
(We're having meat-potato stew, right?)

0x37C
Makoto「Because we're having curry today, right?」%K%P

0x388
I blurt the words in my head out without thinking.%K%P

0x394
I have no clue why I just said that.%K%P

0x3A0
It felt like I was being manipulated by some unknown%Nforce.%K%P

0x3AC
Izumi「Yes... It's true that today... we're having curry, but...」%K%P

0x3C8
Yuka「Makoto...」%K%P

0x3E4
Kurumi「Onii-chan, how? How did you know we were having curry?」%K%P

0x400
Okuhiko「Ishihara. It couldn't be another one of... Just what kind of%Njoke is it this time?」%K%P

0x40C
Okuhiko narrows his eyes and glares at me.%K%P

0x418
(This is bad...)%K%P

0x424
(If this keeps up, the tension in this place is only going%Nto become worse.)%K%P

0x430
(I've got to trick them somehow...)%K%P

0x43C
Makoto「No... you see...」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「I saw them...」%K%P

0x454
Makoto「Earlier, I saw the ingredients... that Izumi-san had bought.」%K%P

0x470
Izumi「Huh...?」%K%P

0x47C
Okuhiko「Ingredients...?」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「Potatoes, carrots, onions, beef... and then curry powder.」%K%P

0x4B4
Yuka「I see. With that, anyone would realize you're making curry.」%K%P

0x4C0
Okuhiko「Hmm...」%K%P

0x4D4
Sheesh... For now, it seems everyone believes me.%K%P

0x4E0
I wipe the cold sweat off my forehead.%K%P

0x4EC
Just then...%K%P

0x500
Haruka「We're having... curry for dinner...」%K%P

0x50C
... Haruka suddenly mutters this.%K%P

Yuka「Curry, huh...」%K%P

0x554
Okuhiko「Hmm, curry...」%K%P

0x560
Kurumi「Curry...」%K%P

0x56C
Everyone unanimously mutters the word 'curry'.%K%P

0x578
Judging by their unenthusiasm, it seems that none of%Nthem like curry very much.%K%P

0x594
Makoto「Because we're having cream stew today, right?」%K%P

0x5A0
I blurt the words in my head out without thinking.%K%P

0xA24
(???)%K%P

0xA30
(Well, I don't really care.)%K%P

0xA3C
(I don't need to know where he's going or what he's%Ndoing...)%K%P

0xA48
... Just then, Kurumi speaks up...%K%P

0xA5C
