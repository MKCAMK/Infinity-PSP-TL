I suddenly wake up.%K%P

0x68
I fell asleep without realizing it...%K%P

0x74
My watch says "11:38 A.M.".%K%P

0x80
It's a lot later than when I normally wake up.%K%P

0xC0
There's no one in the living room.%K%P

0xCC
I wonder where they've all gone?%K%P

0xD8
I wash my face, brush my teeth, change my clothes, and%Nhead out.%K%P

0xE4
My destination is obvious.%K%P

0xF0
―I'm going to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x130
With the sky as cloudy as it is, it's hard to believe that it%Nwas so starry last night.%K%P

0x13C
The multi-layered clouds completely cover the sky... but%Nthey don't seem like rain clouds.%K%P

0x148
The dreary sky is starting to make me feel gloomy.%K%P

0x154
At any rate, this weather is unpleasant.%K%P

0x1A4
The wind is eerily still.%K%P

0x1B0
The trees aren't swaying and nor are the birds chirping.%NIt's as if time has frozen.%K%P

0x1BC
The sun is covered by thick clouds, so I don't even cast%Na shadow.%K%P

0x1D8
Kurumi「Ah, Onii-chan♪」%K%P

0x200
When I get halfway down the road, I see Kurumi running%Ntowards me from up ahead.%K%P

0x214
Kurumi「Were you going somewhere now?」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「Y-Yeah... kinda...」%K%P

0x22C
There's no way I can tell her I was going to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x238
If Kurumi ends up tagging along, I can't carry out my plan%Nto ask Izumi-san for the rest of the story.%K%P

0x244
It's vital that I trick her into going away.%K%P

0x250
Kurumi「'Kinda'... you say...」%K%P

0x264
Kurumi「Ah... could it be that you're going to see Onee-chan%Nagain?」%K%P

0x270
I'm shocked that she guessed it right...%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「N-No... I was just going to walk around today...」%K%P

0x288
Makoto「You see, this weather... isn't good, but occasionally, I like%Ntaking walks under the cloudy sky. Strange, huh?」%K%P

0x294
Kurumi「'Strange'...」%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「More importantly, where are you planning on going?%NThere's no one at the lodge.」%K%P

0x2AC
Kurumi「Kurumi came here to see Onii-chan!」%K%P

0x2B8
Makoto「Me?」%K%P

0x2DC
Kurumi「Yeah. You promised to definitely come next time to watch%Nthe crab sumo, right?」%K%P

0x2E8
Ah... Now that she mentions it, I said that on this road%Nyesterday.%K%P

0x2FC
Kurumi「Yeah. Yesterday, Kurumi tried to invite you to go see%Ncrab sumo...」%K%P

0x308
Ah... now that I think about it, Kurumi suddenly ran off%Nangrily yesterday for some reason...%K%P

0x314
It was definitely on this road as well...%K%P

0x320
Kurumi「So let's go watch some crab sumo♪」%K%P

0x32C
Makoto「No, but... I have to go take a wal―」%K%P

0x338
Kurumi「A walk? It's not like you promised to walk with someone%Nelse, right?」%K%P

0x344
Makoto「W-Well, that's true, but...」%K%P

0x350
Kurumi「Then it's no problem at all, right?」%K

0x20D0
Yes, it is.

0x20DC
You're right.

0x390
Makoto「It is a problem! I'm really in the mood for a walk today. I%Ntold myself I was going to do it, so I have to.」%K%P

0x39C
Makoto「If I don't do it, I think I'll really start to kick myself over it-」%K%P

0x3B0
Kurumi「Then Kurumi will go with you～♪」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3C8
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x3D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3E0
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x3EC
Makoto「... Well, that was a joke. In reality, there's no problem at all%Nwhatsoever～」%K%P

0x3F8
Kurumi「Eheh♪ Well then, it's decided!」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「It's no problem at all... maybe.」%K%P

0x418
Kurumi「Right?」%K%P

0x42C
Kurumi「Let's go, let's go, let's see the crabs sumo♪」%K%P

0x440
Kurumi grabs my arm and skips down the hill road...%K%P

0x44C
At any rate, why is Kurumi so cheerful?%K%P

0x458
I can't see any signs of the loneliness she showed last%Nnight while looking at the sea.%K%P

0x464
Did she get over it after sleeping for one night?%K%P

0x470
No, that's impossible.%K%P

0x47C
That scar wasn't something that was born just%Nyesterday.%K%P

0x488
Could it be that she keeps her loneliness locked tightly%Nin the bottom of her heart?%K%P

0x494
Is she trying too hard to act overly cheerful...?%K%P

0x4A0
When I think that, I start to wonder if Kurumi's pure%Nlaughter is also completely fake...%K%P

0x4F8
Kurumi「Gotcha♪」%K%P

0x504
It hasn't even been five minutes since we arrived at%NPrincess Beach, and yet Kurumi's already caught a crab.%K%P

0x510
Makoto「Hey! Don't trip!」%K%P

0x51C
Kurumi grabs the edge of a rock, and peeks down at a%Nditch as I call her from far away.%K%P

0x528
Kurumi「It's all right!」%K%P

0x534
Kurumi is acting like a carefree child.%K%P

0x540
Kurumi「Hey, Mr. Crab. Wanna play Rock-Paper-Scissors with%NKurumi?」%K%P

0x54C
Kurumi「Ready, set, Rock, Paper, Scissors... Rock!」%K%P

0x558
Kurumi「Yay, Kurumi won～♪」%K%P

0x564
(It's like... the Kurumi last night was fake...)%K%P

0x570
(Could it be... that that was a dream? I was a little drunk,%Nafter all...)%K%P

0x57C
While looking at Kurumi acting so innocently, I seriously%Nbegin to consider that possibility.%K%P

0x588
A scar on her back, huh...%K%P

0x594
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x5A0
Makoto「Hmm? What's wrong?」%K%P

0x5AC
Kurumi「No... it's nothing!」%K%P

0x5B8
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x5C4
Kurumi「Kurumi just picked up something a little interesting!」%K%P

0x5D0
Makoto「Something interesting?」%K%P

0x5DC
Kurumi suddenly jumps off the rocks onto the sand, and%Nruns over to me.%K%P

0x5F0
Makoto「What's this something interesting?」%K%P

0x5FC
Kurumi「You wanna see it?」%K%P

0x608
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x614
Kurumi「Then you can... if you beat Kurumi in%NRock-Paper-Scissors♪」%K%P

0x620
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x62C
Kurumi「Let's go～♪ Rock, Paper, Scissors...」%K%P

0x638
Makoto「Go!」%K%P

0x644
Kurumi stretches the crab's claw out.%K%P

0x650
... Incidentally, I have paper.%K%P

0x664
Kurumi「Yay, Mr. Crab won～♪ Isn't this fun, Sumo Crab? Are you%Nglad?」%K%P

0x670
Kurumi happily addresses the crab. Geez, don't name it...%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「... I... have paper.」%K%P

0x688
Kurumi「Like Kurumi said, you don't get to see it, Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x694
Kurumi puts the "something interesting" in her pocket.%K%P

0x6BC
―Huh???%K%P

0x6C8
Just now, I thought I heard something...%K%P

0x6D4
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan! Hurry up, let's watch the crab sumo!」%K%P

0x6E0
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x6F4
... ... ...%K%P

0x708
Kurumi「Ready! ... Go!」%K%P

0x714
Before long, the two crabs begin to sumo on a flat rock%Nbeing used as the arena.%K%P

0x720
Kurumi is serving as the referee, and I am the audience.%K%P

0x72C
Kurumi「Go, go!」%K%P

0x738
Kurumi and I hold our breaths in anticipation.%K%P

0x744
Kurumi「GOOOO!」%K%P

0x750
... The small crab pushes off the larger crab with its small%Nclaws!%K%P

0x75C
Kurumi「Ring out! Sumo Crab wins♪」%K%P

0x768
Wait, is that the crab that beat me in%NRock-Paper-Scissors earlier? I guess giving it a name%Nwas a good way to distinguish them.%K%P

0x774
Kurumi pets both the winning and losing crabs equally.%K%P

0x780
After that, she lets the losing crab go while waving%Nsorrowfully at it...%K%P

0x78C
... It's quite a pleasant scene.%K%P

0x798
(It should be all right if ask Izumi-san about that story%Ntonight...)%K%P

0x7A4
I think this to myself.%K%P

0x7B0
I'm not giving up, just putting it on hold.%K%P

0x7BC
I just want to look at Kurumi as she is right now forever.%K%P

0x7C8
Kurumi's smile seems like an angel's...%K%P

0x7D4
... That angelic smile has blown away all traces of%Nuneasiness in my heart.%K%P

0x7E0
Something has begun to sprout within me ―I finally%Nrealize what it is now.%K%P

0x7EC
It's my want... to watch over Kurumi forever...%K%P

0x844
After almost an hour, the crab sumo has ended.%K%P

0x850
It was quite the splendid victory for Mr. Sumo Crab.%K%P

0x85C
As a reward, we give the crab a year's worth of%Nseaweed by wrapping them around its claws, then return%Nit to the sea...%K%P

0x868
Having finally reached a point where I can take a break, I%Nam suddenly assaulted by hunger.%K%P

0x874
Now that I think about it, I still haven't eaten at all today.%K%P

0x880
Makoto「Ugh, I'm so hungry...」%K%P

0x88C
I mutter this, groaning.%K%P

0x8A0
Kurumi「Hee hee hee hee hee...」%K%P

0x8AC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x8B8
Kurumi「Kurumi thought this would happen...」%K%P

0x8C4
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x8D8
Kurumi「Ta-da♪ It's a KuruKuru Kurumiracle♪」%K%P

0x8E4
Kurumi opens a basket she's been holding.%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「Whoa! Are those rice balls!?」%K%P

0x904
Kurumi「Heh heh♪」%K%P

0x910
Makoto「Was this Izumi-san again!?」%K%P

0x91C
Kurumi shakes her head.%K%P

0x928
Makoto「Which means that you made these, Kurumi!?」%K%P

0x934
Kurumi proudly nods.%K%P

0x940
Makoto「Oh, thank you! Well then, I'll get to it right away... Time to%Neat♪」%K%P

0x94C
I take a bite.%K%P

0x958
Munch, munch... munch, munch... munch, munch...%K%P

0x964
Huh? What's this texture?%K%P

0x970
Lying on top of my tongue is something like a small grain...%K%P

0x97C
When I bite on it, I feel an exquisite, lumpy sensation...%K%P

0x988
It's has a moderately salty taste with an aroma like the%Nseashore that's spreading all over my mouth...%K%P

0x994
I've never tasted it up until now, but it's so good that I%Nfeel like I've died and gone to heaven!%K%P

0x9A0
Makoto「Kurumi... what's... in these?」%K%P

0x9AC
Kurumi「Caviar.」%K%P

0x9B8
Makoto「Ah... caviar... so that's why it's so good...」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「Wait, CAVIAR!? You mean one of the three greatest%Ndelicacies of the world!?」%K%P

0x9D0
Kurumi「That's right.」%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「Is it the real deal?」%K%P

0x9E8
Kurumi「Of course♪ It was in the fridge at the shop, so Kurumi%Nborrowed some♪」%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「Does Izumi-san know about this?」%K%P

0xA00
Kurumi「Nope.」%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「'Nope'... then is it all right? Caviar is ridiculously%Nexpensive, isn't it?」%K%P

0xA18
Kurumi「It's all right, it's all right. Onee-chan isn't the kind of%Nperson who will notice it...」%K%P

0xA24
Makoto「Even though you say she won't notice, it seems that you%Nused quite a lot. How much caviar did you use anyway?」%K%P

0xA30
Kurumi「One bottle of it. Kurumi completely used up that bottle♪」%K%P

0xA3C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA48
Kurumi「But if Kurumi gets rid of the bottle, then on the other%Nhand, Onee-chan won't notice anything, right?」%K%P

0xA54
Izumi-san... your sister is amazing...%K%P

0xA60
Kurumi「Ah... Hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0xA6C
Kurumi「When we're done eating, you wanna do something fun?」%K%P

0xA78
Makoto「Something fun???」%K%P

0xB1C
My hunger satisfied, we rest for a while, and then walk%Ntowards Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0xB28
"You wanna do something fun?" We came here because I%Ndecide to abide by Kurumi's words.%K%P

0xB34
However, as usual, she didn't tell me any details.%K%P

0xB40
"It'll be more fun to find out when you get there yourself,"%Nshe said...%K%P

0xB4C
...%K%P

0xB58
When we walk down the road surrounded by cherry%Nblossom trees, Kurumi suddenly asks me something.%K%P

0xB6C
Kurumi「Hey? What's your dream, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0xB78
Dream, huh...%K%P

0xB84
Makoto「I have something vague, but nothing in particular you%Ncould really call a clear dream...」%K%P

0xB90
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0xB9C
Makoto「What's yours?」%K%P

0xBB0
Kurumi「Kurumi's dream...」%K%P

0xBBC
Kurumi「Is to become a wife♪」%K%P

0xBC8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBDC
Kurumi「Ah... Kurumi bets you think it's rather dull and ordinary,%Ndon't you?」%K%P

0xBE8
Makoto「No, I don't...」%K%P

0xBF4
Makoto「I... think it's good. It sounds very girly...」%K%P

0xC00
Kurumi「Teheh♪」%K%P

0xC14
Kurumi「Kurumi has always wanted a warm family.」%K%P

0xC20
Kurumi「You see, with her family, her Papa and Mama do nothing%Nbut research, so they rarely come home...」%K%P

0xC2C
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0xC38
Kurumi「To become a wife... to have a warm family... What an%Nordinary dream...」%K%P

0xC44
Kurumi「But even though it's 'ordinary', Kurumi thinks that it's a%Nvery happy thing...」%K%P

0xC50
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC5C
Kurumi「When Kurumi's husband comes home from work all%Nexhausted, she'll first give him a bowl of warm soup.」%K%P

0xC68
Kurumi「She'll prepare a warm bath for him... and pour him a cup of%Nwarm sake...」%K%P

0xC74
Kurumi「Our kids will get between us, and we'll all have warm%Nsmiles rise to our faces...」%K%P

0xC80
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC8C
Kurumi「In the summer, we'll leave the windows open, and the%Nwhole family will watch a night game on TV while listening%Nto the wind chimes...」%K%P

0xC98
Kurumi「In the winter, we'll wrap ourselves up in a kotatsu, and%Nwatch cold medicine commercials while eating oranges...」%K%P

0xCA4
Cold medicine commercials, huh...%K%P

0xCB0
Kurumi「We won't need anything special... Just ordinary days...%Nas a very plain, ordinary family...」%K%P

0xCBC
Kurumi「At night, Kurumi will bury her face in her husband's warm%Nchest... and sleep soundly...」%K%P

0xCC8
Kurumi「That alone will be enough to make Kurumi happy...」%K%P

0xCD4
Makoto「... Yeah. That's definitely happiness. Something like that%Nis true happiness... probably.」%K%P

0xCE0
Kurumi listens to me, and gives me a slightly%Nembarrassed smile.%K%P

0xCEC
The cherry blossom petals flutter and fall down, and one%Nof them lands on the tip of Kurumi's nose.%K%P

0xCF8
Kurumi gently brushes it off with her fingertip while giving%Nanother embarrassed smile.%K%P

0xD14
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0xD20
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0xD2C
Kurumi「... Your chest... is it warm?」%K%P

0xD38
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xD44
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xD50
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD5C
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0xD68
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xD74
Kurumi「C'mon, let's hurry up and do that 'something fun'♪」%K%P

0xD88
Kurumi drags me by my hand, and guides me towards%NViewpoint Park...%K%P

0xD94
For some reason, although the sky is gray, my heart is%Nas clear as a blue sky on a sunny day...%K%P

0xE30
Kurumi and I arrive at Viewpoint Park, and sit down on the%Ntiles with a thump.%K%P

0xE3C
When we do, Kurumi reaches into the bottom of the empty%Nbasket, and slowly takes something out.%K%P

0xE48
It's something thin and square wrapped up in plastic.%K%P

0xE54
Makoto「What's that?」%K%P

0xE68
Kurumi「Ta-da♪ It's KuruKuru Kurumi Magic♪」%K%P

0xE74
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xE80
Kurumi「O-R-I-G-A-M-I... It's origami.」%K%P

0xE8C
Makoto「And what are we doing with it?」%K%P

0xE98
Kurumi「'What'? ... Isn't it obvious what you do when you have%Norigami?」%K%P

0xEA4
Makoto「R-Right...」%K%P

0xEB0
Kurumi「Onii-chan, can you fold origami?」%K

0x20E8
I can only fold cranes.

0x20F4
I can't.

0xEF0
Makoto「If it's folding cranes, I can do that.」%K%P

0xEFC
Kurumi「What? That's the best you can do?」%K%P

0xF08
Makoto「Isn't it enough if I just fold cranes?」%K%P

0xF1C
Kurumi「It's not! ... Guess you're a Level 3 with 514 EXP.」%K%P

0xF28
Makoto「?」%K%P

0xF3C
Makoto「I can't.」%K%P

0xF50
Kurumi「What!? There's someone in these times of recession that%Ncan't fold origami!? Impossible!」%K%P

0xF5C
What the hell does origami have to do with a recession?%K%P

0xF70
Kurumi「All right then, Kurumi will teach you!」%K%P

0xF7C
Makoto「P-Please do so...」%K%P

0xF90
...%K%P

0xF9C
And thus, Professor Kurumi's Origami 101 class begins.%K%P

0xFB0
Kurumi「And you do this over here, and fold it like this...」%K%P

0xFBC
Makoto「L-Like this?」%K%P

0xFD0
Kurumi「Wrong! Don't use the mountain folding style, use the%Nvalley folding style!!!」%K%P

0xFDC
Makoto「Oh, like this?」%K%P

0xFE8
Kurumi「No! First, you turn it inside out, and only fold the left side%Nlike a valley!」%K%P

0xFF4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1000
Origami is really hard...%K%P

0x100C
Fold, fold... fold, fold... fold, fold... bend, bend...%K%P

0x1018
―Riiiip.%K%P

0x102C
Kurumi「Aaah! Why is it completely torn off!?」%K%P

0x1038
Makoto「No, it's not like I was trying to-」%K%P

0x1044
Kurumi「Oh, geez... Here!」%K%P

0x1050
Kurumi pulls out a new sheet of origami paper, and gives%Nit to me.%K%P

0x1064
Kurumi「We'll start again from the top!」%K%P

0x1078
Professor Kurumi is surprisingly strict...%K%P

0x10F4
Makoto「All right! It's done!」%K%P

0x1108
Kurumi「Let's see it!」%K%P

0x1114
Makoto「Ta-da♪ It's a MakoMako Makoto Masterpiece♪」%K%P

0x1120
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x112C
Makoto「Well? I did a pretty damn good job, wouldn't you say?」%K%P

0x1138
Kurumi「Hmm... maybe a 62 out of 100?」%K%P

0x1144
Kurumi「The tail is completely off-mark.」%K%P

0x1150
Professor Kurumi really is strict.%K%P

0x115C
Makoto「But for a beginner like me, it's way too difficult to make a%Ngood turtle out of the blue.」%K%P

0x1168
Kurumi「Well, Kurumi supposes that's true. It seems even%Nveterans fail with turtles sometimes...」%K%P

0x1174
Kurumi「They say that amongst origami maniacs, it takes about%Nthree years to perfect a peach and chestnut tree, and%Nabout eight years for a turtle...」%K%P

0x1180
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x118C
Incidentally, what's Kurumi been up to? Thinking that, I%Nlook towards her...%K%P

0x1198
Makoto「Whoa! When did you make so many...!?」%K%P

0x11A4
In a mere ten minutes, Kurumi has folded many different%Norigami.%K%P

0x11B0
Moreover, everything is so accurately folded that there%Nisn't even an inch of a gap where the two ends of the%Npaper meet.%K%P

0x11BC
She's a genius...%K%P

0x11D0
Kurumi「Isn't it amazing?」%K%P

0x11DC
Kurumi says this proudly.%K%P

0x11E8
As she says this, I carefully pick up one of them in%Nbetween my fingers.%K%P

0x11F4
Makoto「What's this?」%K%P

0x1200
Kurumi「A horned beetle.」%K%P

0x120C
Makoto「Then what's this?」%K%P

0x1218
Kurumi「King Girado.」%K%P

0x1224
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1230
Kurumi「And this is 'Takeda Shingen', this is a 'Morning Glory', this%Nis the 'Okinawa Summit'...」%K%P

0x123C
Wow, there's a lot of variation...%K%P

0x1248
(Wait, the Okinawa Summit...?)%K%P

0x1254
Makoto「... Oh... but Kurumi? There's one more left, isn't there?」%K%P

0x1260
Kurumi「Oh, this?」%K%P

0x126C
As she says that, Kurumi takes the last one left and%Nplaces it on her palm.%K%P

0x1278
Makoto「This wrinkled origami... what is it?」%K%P

0x1284
Kurumi「This is...」%K%P

0x1298
Kurumi「... Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x12A4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x12B0
Kurumi「This is Onii-chan when he's smiling!」%K%P

0x12BC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x12D0
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x12DC
Makoto「... It-It doesn't resemble me... No matter how you look at it,%Nit doesn't resemble me at all, does it!?」%K%P

0x12E8
Makoto「It doesn't look anywhere near as badass as Takeda%NShingen!」%K%P

0x12F4
Kurumi「Dunno about that... Kurumi thinks you look like it...」%K%P

0x1308
Kurumi「Well, whatever...」%K%P

0x131C
Kurumi「Kurumi will give you this... as a commemoration♪」%K%P

0x1328
Kurumi places "me" on my palm.%K%P

0x1334
Kurumi「It's a modest present from Kurumi...」%K%P

0x1340
This wrinkled, smiling face...%K%P

0x134C
An origami that Kurumi folded herself...%K%P

0x1358
(... It really doesn't look like me...)%K%P

0x1364
Although I think this...%K%P

0x1370
Makoto「Th-Thank you...」%K%P

0x1384
... I mutter these words, and carefully place "me" in my%Npocket.%K%P

0x1390
A smile rises to Kurumi's face, and she looks at me with%Nkindness...%K%P

0x140C
After that, Kurumi and I continue to fold origami for an%Nhour.%K%P

0x1418
Before I know it, I realize that Kurumi's childlike innocence%Nis rubbing off on me.%K%P

0x1424
We use up all the origami, the black papers, the silver%Npapers, and the gold papers.%K%P

0x1430
However, there's one sheet of white origami paper left...%K%P

0x143C
Kurumi places all of the completed origami works in the%Nempty basket like a mountain.%K%P

0x1448
She closes the lid, and with a snap, lowers the snap%Nfastener.%K%P

0x1454
And then, without a word, Kurumi takes the last white%Npaper and begins to fold it.%K%P

0x1460
I keep my mouth shut and silently watch her skillful%Nhandling.%K%P

0x1474
Kurumi「It's done♪」%K%P

0x1480
It's a white paper airplane.%K%P

0x148C
It hasn't been folded in the traditional style, but rather%Nmade using the Kurumi style's unique folding method.%K%P

0x1498
Kurumi「Kurumi will call it Kurumi Unit 17!」%K%P

0x14A4
Makoto「Unit 17?」%K%P

0x14B0
Kurumi「Yeah. Kurumi spent day and night researching and%Nresearching to come up with the best way to fold it so it%Nwould fly the farthest.」%K%P

0x14BC
Makoto「In other words, this is Version 17?」%K%P

0x14C8
Kurumi「That's right♪」%K%P

0x14D4
Kurumi「Ah... but this folding method is a trade secret. You%Nmustn't tell anyone about it, no matter what.」%K%P

0x14E0
Kurumi「Kurumi still hasn't told anyone either, so...」%K%P

0x14EC
Makoto「Yeah... I understand.」%K%P

0x14F8
When she hears my response, Kurumi lightly nods, and%Nquietly stands up.%K%P

0x1504
She walks over towards the handrail.%K%P

0x1510
I also get up and follow after her...%K%P

0x151C
Kurumi「Hey, take a look.」%K%P

0x1528
Kurumi says this...%K%P

0x1534
Kurumi「Go♪」%K%P

0x1558
... and throws the paper airplane into the sky.%K%P

0x1564
Unit 17 glides in a straight line... flying above the windless%Nsea...%K%P

0x1570
Endlessly... endlessly... endlessly flying without%Ndestination...%K%P

0x157C
It's like it's drawing a straight white line...%K%P

0x1588
I steadily begin to lose sight of the airplane as it gets%Nsmaller...%K%P

0x1594
All I see are its triangular wings, and before long, it's%Nnothing more than a dot... I can't even see any ripples.%K%P

0x15A8
Kurumi「You see?」%K%P

0x15BC
Kurumi is happy.%K%P

0x15C8
I don't know why, but I become happy as well.%K%P

0x15D4
... Kurumi and I spontaneously hold hands, and leave%NViewpoint Park, the park where Unit 17 took off on its first%Nand last flight.%K%P

0x1648
Kurumi「Wasn't today fun?」%K%P

0x1654
We're on our way back to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x1660
Kurumi「It was an ultra-good day, wasn't it?」%K%P

0x166C
Makoto「You're right.」%K%P

0x1678
Kurumi「Onii-chan, did you have fun too?」%K%P

0x1684
Makoto「Of course.」%K%P

0x1690
I smile as I answer.%K%P

0x16A4
Kurumi「Yay♪」%K%P

0x16B0
There's no wind, but because of these clouds, it's cold%Nright now.%K%P

0x16BC
However, I only feel warmth through my hand.%K%P

0x16C8
It's Kurumi's warmth.%K%P

0x16D4
Kurumi「Hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x16E0
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x16EC
Kurumi「Kurumi... wants to show you something, okay?」%K%P

0x16F8
Makoto「Show me something?」%K%P

0x170C
Kurumi「If it's you, Onii-chan, then she can show you...」%K%P

0x1720
Kurumi says this, then suddenly brings me into a thicket%Non the side of the road.%K%P

0x1768
Makoto「W-What is it...? Why did you suddenly drag me in here...?」%K%P

0x177C
Kurumi doesn't answer.%K%P

0x1788
She remains silent... and turns around for some reason,%Nher back facing me.%K%P

0x179C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x17A8
Just then...%K%P

0x17B4
Whoosh...%K%P

0x17C0
―All of the sudden, Kurumi raises all the clothes off%Nthe upper half of her body up to her neck...%K%P

0x17CC
I can now see... Kurumi's small back.%K%P

0x17F4
On it is that deeply engraved... "scar".%K%P

0x1800
(Kurumi...)%K%P

0x180C
I instinctively take a step backwards.%K%P

0x1818
That's because her scar is so...%K%P

0x1824
... horrifying...%K%P

0x1830
No, I mustn't avert my eyes.%K%P

0x183C
(This is Kurumi's courage.)%K%P

0x1848
(It's proof that she trusts me.)%K%P

0x1854
I steady myself, and look at the scar.%K%P

0x1860
To be honest, it's a scar that makes me sad just seeing%Nit.%K%P

0x186C
The pointy zigzag lines of scars― lots and lots of%Nsuch lines are running down her tiny, narrow back.%K%P

0x1878
Rough bulges are protruding unnaturally on the%Notherwise smooth surface of her bare skin.%K%P

0x1884
It's a reddish-violet discoloration...%K%P

0x1890
It does nothing but give off a strong sense of sadness.%K%P

0x189C
I don't know what to say.%K%P

0x18A8
I can't find the words.%K%P

0x18B4
"It's no big deal,"... "Don't worry about it,"...%K%P

0x18C0
―No!%K%P

0x18CC
Those aren't the words Kurumi wants to hear!%K%P

0x18D8
But what do I say...?%K%P

0x18E4
Whoosh...%K%P

0x18F0
Kurumi lowers her clothes.%K%P

0x18FC
She turns around to face me.%K%P

0x1908
Kurumi「It's all right... you don't have to say anything...」%K%P

0x1914
Kurumi「All you have to do is think 'Kurumi was selfish for wanting%Nto show it to me'...」%K%P

0x1920
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x192C
Kurumi「Just seeing it... is enough...」%K%P

0x1938
Kurumi...%K%P

0x1944
Kurumi「Well then, shall we hurry back?」%K%P

0x1988
Kurumi「Ruun, ruun, ruun, Kurumi-chan～, ran, ran, ran, Onii-chan～♪」%K%P

0x1994
Kurumi is back to the way she was just minutes ago...%K%P

0x19A0
As if nothing happened...%K%P

0x19AC
What... What...%K%P

0x19B8
―What the hell am I doing!?%K%P

0x19C4
Even though Kurumi courageously showed it to me...%K%P

0x19D0
Even though she trusted me...%K%P

0x19DC
Why am I so down!?%K%P

0x19E8
The scar has nothing to do with anything!%K%P

0x19F4
Kurumi is Kurumi, isn't she!?%K%P

0x1A00
I thought to myself that I wanted to watch over her%Nforever, right!?%K%P

0x1A0C
Then what should I do right now!?%K%P

0x1A18
Shouldn't I be acting normal, the way I usually am!?%K%P

0x1A24
I won't... hurt Kurumi any more...%K%P

0x1A30
Makoto「Kurumi...?」%K%P

0x1A44
Kurumi「Hmm? What, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x1A50
Makoto「Kurumi, you love things like haunted houses, right?」%K%P

0x1A5C
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x1A68
Makoto「... Do you hate them?」%K%P

0x1A7C
Kurumi「Nope♪ Kurumi loves them♪」%K%P

0x1A88
Makoto「All right! Then when we get back to the mainland, let's go%Nto an amusement park!」%K%P

0x1A9C
Kurumi「Huh!? You'll take Kurumi?」%K%P

0x1AA8
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x1ABC
Kurumi「Yaay～♪」%K%P

0x1AD0
Kurumi「For real?」%K%P

0x1ADC
Makoto「For real.」%K%P

0x1AE8
Kurumi「Don't say 'I forgot' when it happens! You won't, right?」%K%P

0x1AF4
Makoto「I won't.」%K%P

0x1B00
Kurumi「Then, let's pinky swear.」%K%P

0x1B0C
Kurumi takes out her thin pinky and wraps it around mine...%K%P

0x1B18
Kurumi「Cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die If-you-lie...♪」%K%P

0x1B24
Kurumi「Ah... what should we do if you lie?」%K%P

0x1B30
Makoto「... What do you think?」%K%P

0x1B3C
Kurumi「Let's see...」%K%P

0x1B48
Kurumi「If you lie, kiss Kurumi on the cheek... okay?」%K%P

0x1B54
Kiss her on the cheek...%K%P

0x1B60
... My chest feels hot.%K%P

0x1B6C
Makoto「Yeah... got it.」%K%P

0x1B78
I give a deep nod as I answer.%K%P

0x1B8C
...%K%P

0x1B98
On our way back... Kurumi and I keep our pinkies wrapped%Naround each other as we walk back to Lunabeach...%K%P

0x1C2C
We meet up with Izumi-san, and have dinner at%NLunabeach.%K%N%N

0x1C38
「"And so then, Mr. Sumo Crab...♪"」%K%N%N

0x1C4C
Kurumi excitedly tells Izumi-san about today's events.%K%N

0x1C58
Izumi-san quietly listens to her talking while smiling gently.%K%P

0x1C6C
Such a cheerful dinner...%K%N

0x1C78
There's not even a single bit of gloominess to be found...%K%N

0x1C84
Not from the music flowing from the jukebox...%K%N

0x1C90
Not from the roar of waves, constantly going in and out%Nof the shore...%K%N

0x1C9C
Not from Izumi-san's homemade corn soup...%K%N

0x1CA8
Not from Kurumi's face... Not from Izumi-san's face...%K%P

0x1CB4
... All of them are warm.%K%N

0x1CC0
I am completely intoxicated by the comfortable mood in%Nthis sunshine-like warmth.%K%P

0x1CD4
「"By the way, Kurumi?」%K%N%N

0x1CE0
「"Hmm?」%K%N%N

0x1CEC
「"Do you know what happened to the caviar in the fridge?」%K%N%N

0x1CF8
「"...」%K%N%N

0x1D04
「"...」%K%P
