Kurumi「Onii-chaan! Waaait!」%K%P

0x4C
Kurumi chases after me as I walk down the forest road%Ntowards the ocean.%K%P

0xB8
Kurumi「Haah... finally caught up to you...」%K%P

0xC4
Makoto「Hmm? What's wrong, Kurumi?」%K%P

0xD8
Kurumi「Kurumi was going to go to Princess Beach to watch%Nsome crab sumo wrestling, so she thought she could go%Nwith you up until she got there...」%K%P

0xE4
Makoto「I see.」%K%P

0x100
Wait, what the hell is "Crab sumo"!? Well, it's pretty%Nself-explanatory, but...%K%P

0x10C
Kurumi「So, where are you going, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x118
Makoto「To Lunabeach... I thought I'd try my hand at being%NIzumi-san's assistant...」%K%P

0x12C
Kurumi「Hmm... you're going to see Onee-chan then...」%K%P

0x138
She looks like she wants to say something.%K

0x1AA8
Do you want to go with me?

0x1AB4
Is there something you want to say?

0x188
Makoto「Do you want to go to Lunabeach too?」%K%P

0x19C
Kurumi「Huh? But... Kurumi wants to watch the crab sumo...」%K%P

0x1A8
Makoto「The crabs won't go extinct today, right?」%K%P

0x1B4
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「What I'm saying that is that you could see it whenever,%Nlike tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, right?」%K%P

0x1CC
Kurumi「Oh, that's what you mean... But Kurumi wants to see the%Ncrab sumo today, no matter what...」%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「Then I guess that's a 'no'...」%K%P

0x1E4
Kurumi「But couldn't you do the same, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x1F0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1FC
Kurumi「Onee-chan won't go extinct today, right?」%K%P

0x208
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x214
Kurumi「You also can help Onee-chan whenever, right? Like%Ntomorrow, or the day after that...」%K%P

0x220
Makoto「Ah... well, that's true, but...」%K%P

0x234
Kurumi「Then go to Princess Beach with Kurumi today!」%K%P

0x240
Hmm... Crab sumo, huh...%K%P

0x24C
Well, that does sound kinda fun...%K%P

0x258
But I've already decided to go to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x264
However, I decide that when I'm done with that... I'll go see%Nthe crab sumo next time.%K%P

0x270
Makoto「I'm sorry Kurumi, but I've already decided to go to%NLunabeach today.」%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「I'll see the crab sumo next time... okay?」%K%P

0x290
Kurumi「Next time, huh...」%K%P

0x29C
Kurumi slumps her shoulders.%K%P

0x2A8
But she soon seems to pull herself together...%K%P

0x2BC
Kurumi「All right, got it. Then be sure to come next time, okay?」%K%P

0x2C8
... and replies cheerfully.%K%P

0x2D4
...%K%P

0x2E0
Kurumi「Well then, see you later, Onii-chan.」%K%P

0x2F4
Kurumi runs ahead towards Princess Beach...%K%P

0x308
Makoto「Do you want to say something?」%K%P

0x314
Kurumi「Not really... there's nothing in particular Kurumi wants to%Nsay.」%K%P

0x320
I don't know why, but Kurumi seems to be getting angry%Nright now...%K%P

0x32C
Makoto「Why are you angry?」%K%P

0x340
Kurumi「Kurumi's not angry!」%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「Hmm... all right, then...」%K%P

0x358
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x370
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x390
Kurumi「Hey! How is it 'all right'!? Kurumi's angry!」%K%P

0x39C
Makoto「So you were mad after all, weren't you...」%K%P

0x3B0
Kurumi「There's no way Kurumi's mad!」%K%P

0x3BC
Makoto「Hey, hey... which is it?」%K%P

0x3C8
Kurumi「Whatever! Onii-chan, you, you...」%K%P

0x3D4
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x3E0
Kurumi「Even though Kurumi thought she'd take the the trouble%Nof trying to invite you to the crab sumo!」%K%P

0x3EC
Makoto「'Trouble'... how is saying the words, 'Onii-chan, wanna go%Nwatch crab sumo with me?' trouble?」%K%P

0x400
Kurumi「Waaaaah...」%K%P

0x414
Kurumi「Onii-chan, you idiot!」%K%P

0x428
Kurumi shouts this and runs off...%K%P

0x434
(Damn it... what's up with Kurumi...?)%K%P

0x440
I can't understand Kurumi's indignant behavior at all...%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「Hello there!」%K%P

0x4D0
I open the door to Lunabeach.%K%P

0x504
Izumi「Oh, Makoto-kun... welcome.」%K%P

0x510
Makoto「There's no need to greet me as a customer today.」%K%P

0x51C
Izumi「Huh? Why?」%K%P

0x528
Makoto「Because I came to help you... For today, I will be an%Nemployee of Lunabeach.」%K%P

0x544
Izumi「An employee...」%K%P

0x550
Makoto「Huh? Would that be too bothersome?」%K%P

0x55C
Izumi「No, I'm really grateful that you're offering to help, but...」%K%P

0x568
Izumi「Um... we're not accepting part-time workers right now.」%K%P

0x574
Makoto「Ha ha ha... I didn't come here for a job.」%K%P

0x580
Makoto「I'm just volunteering, that's all...」%K%P

0x58C
Izumi「Really?」%K%P

0x598
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0x5A4
Izumi「... All right! Well then, I'll accept your offer. What would you%Nlike to help with?」%K%P

0x5B0
Makoto「Anything you ask me to do.」%K%P

0x5BC
Izumi「Well then... Let's see...」%K%P

0x5C8
Izumi「... I know. First... could you wash the plates?」%K%P

0x5D4
Makoto「Sure thing. Leave it to me to get any job done!」%K%P

0x5E0
Izumi「When that's done, can you clean the shop's windows for%Nme?」%K%P

0x5EC
Makoto「Okay!」%K%P

0x5F8
Izumi「Then when that's done, mop the floor, then when it's dry,%Nwax it...」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「Y-Yeah, that's fine.」%K%P

0x610
Izumi「After that, sweep and clean the front of the shop for me...」%K%P

0x61C
Izumi「Next, refill the sugar and fresh cream on the tables...」%K%P

0x628
Izumi「While you're at it, the lightbulbs on the second floor are%Ndead, so I'd like it if you could replace those...」%K%P

0x634
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x640
Izumi「Oh! And finally, I need you to go shopping with me!」%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x658
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you've heard about today's barbecue,%Nright?」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「Barbecue?」%K%P

0x670
Izumi「You haven't heard? Everyone's gathering here today at%N5:00.」%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「Ah... I see, that's what Yuka was talking about...」%K%P

0x688
Makoto「... Does that mean that we're going to have a barbecue%Nhere at 5:00?」%K%P

0x694
Izumi「There's no way we can do it here, so... we're having it on%NPrincess Beach.」%K%P

0x6A0
Makoto「Hmm... so that's it...」%K%P

0x6AC
Izumi「That's why I have a lot of preparations I need to make%Nbeforehand...」%K%P

0x6B8
Makoto「I see now.」%K%P

0x6C4
Izumi「But because the car isn't working, I don't think I can%Ncarry all the groceries back here on my own.」%K%P

0x6D0
Makoto「Oh ho.」%K%P

0x6DC
Izumi「So when I'm going shopping, I would like you to come with%Nme, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x6E8
Makoto「O-Oh...」%K%P

0x6F4
Izumi「Am I asking too much of you?」%K

0x1AC0
Not at all!

0x1ACC
Maybe a little.

0x734
Makoto「That much? It'll be a piece of cake! It's no problem at all!!」%K%P

0x740
I'm bluffing.%K%P

0x74C
I already told her I'd help with whatever she wanted me%Nto, so there's no way I can back down now.%K%P

0x758
A man's word is his honor.%K%P

0x764
Izumi「Really? You're a lifesaver〜♪」%K%P

0x770
Izumi「Thank you, Makoto-kun♪」%K%P

0x77C
That smile is all I need to get bursting with energy.%K%P

0x788
I'll get to work right away!%K%P

0x79C
Makoto「It does seem a bit too much... maybe...」%K%P

0x7A8
Izumi「I-Is that so... No matter what the circumstances may be...%Nhuh...」%K%P

0x7B4
Izumi「I guess it's impossible for you, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x7C0
Crap...%K%P

0x7CC
Izumi「If it were Gen-san, the fisherman, he'd have it all done in%Nan hour...」%K%P

0x7D8
Double crap...%K%P

0x7E4
Izumi「But I guess this island is lacking in able men...」%K%P

0x7F0
... Dammit!%K%P

0x7FC
Makoto「It's no problem at all! This much will be a piece of cake!」%K%P

0x808
Makoto「That's too little! It's simple! It'll be easy! Please leave it to%Nme!」%K%P

0x814
Izumi「Huh? Really? You're a lifesaver〜♪」%K%P

0x820
Izumi「Thank you, Makoto-kun♪」%K%P

0x82C
That smile fills me with a dreaded sense of impending%Ndoom...%K%P

0x838
Have I... been trapped...?%K%P

0x8A0
There's eight chores which have to be done.%K%P

0x8AC
I have to wash the plates, clean the windows, mop the%Nfloor, wax it, sweep and clean the front of the shop, refill%Nthe sugar and fresh cream, change the light bulbs, and%Ngo shopping for the barbecue.%K%P

0x8B8
Well, I've already finished washing the plates.%K%P

0x8C4
Right now, I'm wiping the windows outside of the shop.%K%P

0x8D0
*Wipe wipe wipe wipe wipe...*%K%P

0x8DC
The windows are facing the ocean, which means they%Naren't filthy because of dirt.%K%P

0x8E8
Rather, there's salt stuck to them. The grains of sand%Nare now sticking to the windows due to the adhesion%Neffect, as stiff and as hard as rocks.%K%P

0x8F4
At this rate, it seems it'll probably take half a day just to%Npolish the windows.%K%P

0x900
Even it's too late, I'm regretting forcing myself to%Nundertake such a Herculean task.%K%P

0x90C
And... Just then...%K%P

0x95C
—An earthquake hits.%K%P

0x968
It feels stronger than the one on the 1st...%K%P

0x9A0
I hear the sound of tableware breaking from inside the%Nshop.%K%P

0x9AC
Izumi-san...%K%P

0x9B8
I anxiously burst inside Lunabeach.%K%P

0xA00
Makoto「Are you all right, Izumi-san!?」%K%P

0xA0C
By the time I say that, the tremors have already calmed%Ndown.%K%P

0xA20
Izumi「Yes... I'm all right. But...」%K%P

0xA2C
Izumi-san is staring at fragments of broken tableware%Nand glass at her feet.%K%P

0xA38
Makoto「Were those the ones that I washed and placed in the%Nstrainer earlier?」%K%P

0xA44
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0xA50
It seems that all the time and effort I put into carefully%Nwashing them has gone to waste...%K%P

0xA5C
No, wait... in the first place, if I hadn't washed them and%Njust piled them up in the sink, then they probably%Nwouldn't have broken like this.%K%P

0xA68
Makoto「I'm sorry...」%K%P

0xA74
I apologize.%K%P

0xA88
Izumi「'Sorry'? ... Makoto-kun, it's not like you caused the%Nearthquake to happen, right?」%K%P

0xA94
Izumi「It's not your fault...」%K%P

0xAA0
Izumi-san smiles gently at me.%K%P

0xAAC
I feel a little better now.%K%P

0xAB8
Izumi「But this is really annoying... There's a lot of earthquakes%Nat this place...」%K%P

0xAC4
Izumi「Whenever an earthquake occurs, we lose more and more%Ntableware...」%K%P

0xAD0
Izumi「Half of the reason the manager went shopping in Italy is%Nbecause of this.」%K%P

0xADC
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0xAE8
Izumi「Well, no use in crying over spilled milk, right? Let's hurry%Nand clean it up.」%K%P

0xAFC
Izumi-san brings over a dustpan and broom.%K%P

0xB08
I hold the dustpan as Izumi-san gathers the pieces with%Nthe broom.%K%P

0xB14
The tableware and glass have broken into neat shards.%K%P

0xB20
Valuable things are still beautiful even after they've%Nbroken, aren't they?%K%P

0xB2C
For some reason, that's what I think...%K%P

0xBB0
When I've finished seven of my eight assignments, it's a%Nlittle past 3:30.%K%N

0xBBC
I finished window cleaning much earlier than I had%Nexpected, thanks to a salt removing detergent%NIzumi-san lent me.%K%N%N

0xBC8
"A salt removing detergent."%N%N

0xBD4
—I never knew until now something like that existed in%Nthis world.%K%P

0xBE8
This is the same feeling of culture shock I felt in the past%Nwhen a friend of mine who worked in a screw factory%Nproudly showed me a magazine called "Monthly Toolbox".%K%N%N

0xBF4
"Necessity is the mother of invention,"%K%N

0xC00
as he would frequently say.%K%N%N

0xC0C
... Huh? ... Or was it something different than that?%K%P

0xCA0
Well, anyway, because all the tasks are done, Izumi-san%Nand I are in the shopping district now, buying things.%K%P

0xCAC
This is the eighth and final task... to gather everything%Nwe need for the barbecue.%K%P

0xCB8
We buy meat, vegetables, oil, grilling sauce, and large%Nquantities of canned beer.%K%P

0xCC4
Makoto「Do we really... need to buy so much beer?」%K%P

0xCD0
I'm worried that I already know what her answer will be%Nwhen Izumi-san...%K%P

0xCE4
Izumi「Well, Yuka-chan requested it.」%K%P

0xCF0
... confirms my fear with that answer.%K%P

0xCFC
Lunabeach's storehouse already has the other%Nnecessary tools, like the iron plate and charcoal.%K%P

0xD08
With this, we've obtained everything that we'll be using%Nfor the barbecue.%K%P

0xD14
Makoto「Well then, shall we head back now?」%K%P

0xD20
I say this as I hold several bloated shopping bags in%Nboth of my hands.%K%P

0xD2C
Just then...%K%P

0xD38
Izumi「Oh, this is bad... I forgot something. Wait here a bit, okay?」%K%P

0xD4C
... Izumi-san heads back into the store to get that%Nsomething she forgot to buy.%K%P

0xD58
...%K%P

0xD64
Several minutes later, Izumi-san comes out with a plastic%Nbottle of orange juice.%K%P

0xD78
Izumi「Haruka-chan also can't drink alcohol, right?」%K%P

0xD84
Makoto「Huh? ... Really?」%K%P

0xD90
Izumi「Yes. I feel she said so earlier.」%K%P

0xD9C
Izumi「Well, either way, Kurumi can't drink, so at least the juice%Nwon't go to waste.」%K%P

0xDA8
Makoto「Oh, that's right... Kurumi's still in high school, right?」%K%P

0xDB4
Izumi「Right. After all, high-schoolers can't drink alcohol, even if%Nthey want to.」%K%P

0xDC0
Hmm... Izumi-san... she's very straight-laced.%K%P

0xDCC
Izumi「I think she'll definitely want to drink...」%K%P

0xDD8
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xDE4
Izumi「Kurumi's filled with more curiosity than most people, isn't%Nshe?」%K%P

0xDF0
Izumi「It seems that she's really fascinated by things that are%Nforeign and novel to her.」%K%P

0xDFC
Makoto「Ah... now that you mention it, Kurumi was the one who%Nsuggested the Test of Courage yesterday.」%K%P

0xE08
Izumi「It's really quite troublesome... She really loves those%Nkinds of occult-like things.」%K%P

0xE14
Occult...%K%P

0xE20
The word suddenly triggers a memory.%K%P

0xE3C
"An interesting place"... last night, Kurumi said that, and%Ntook me to the shrine.%K%P

0xE48
She was really tenacious about investigating that%Nplace. as if she were thinking "I want to confirm the%Nshrine's true nature!"%K%P

0xE54
Izumi-san sure hit the nail on the head when she said%Nthat "Kurumi's filled with more curiosity than most people."%K%P

0xE60
I ought to talk to her about that.%K%P

0xE6C
Makoto「Yesterday, when you all went to the hot springs, Kurumi...」%K%P

0xE78
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0xE84
Oh shit!!%K%P

0xE90
Izumi-san was extremely opposed to Kurumi going to the%Nshrine.%K%P

0xE9C
If I let it slip that Kurumi went to the shrine, Izumi-san will%Nscold her. I'd be getting her into unnecessary trouble.%K%P

0xEA8
Makoto「... K-Kurumi told me she 'wanted to have another Test of%NCourage♪'...」%K%P

0xEBC
Izumi「As I thought...」%K%P

0xEC8
Whew... it seems she bought it...%K%P

0xED4
But... now I remember what I wanted to ask Izumi-san%Nabout regarding Kurumi.%K%P

0xEE0
Why is it that Izumi-san doesn't want Kurumi to go to the%Nshrine?%K%P

0xEEC
Does she seriously believe that story about the God of%NDemons?%K%P

0xEF8
Is that really the only reason?%K%P

0xF04
I resolve myself, and decide to try asking her.%K%P

0xF10
There shouldn't be anything wrong with at least asking...%K%P

0xF2C
"After this, do you want to go on a Mystery Tour?"%K%P

0xF38
... After Izumi-san finished her story on Moon Beach,%NKurumi spoke with a mischievous glint in her eyes.%K%P

0xF44
Izumi-san sure hit the nail on the head when she said%N"Kurumi's filled with more curiosity than most people."%K%P

0xF50
At that time, because Izumi-san was extremely against it,%Nit looked like she'd give up her plans...%K%P

0xF5C
But... Wait, now I remember what I wanted to ask Izumi-san%Nabout regarding Kurumi.%K%P

0xF68
Why is it that Izumi-san doesn't want Kurumi to go to the%Nshrine?%K%P

0xF74
Does she seriously believe that story about the God of%NKiller Demons?%K%P

0xF80
Is that really the only reason?%K%P

0xF8C
I resolve myself, and decide to ask her.%K%P

0xFA8
Makoto「Hey, Izumi-san? Can I ask you a question?」%K%P

0xFB4
Izumi「Hmm? What?」%K%P

0xFC0
Makoto「It's about that shrine...」%K%P

0xFCC
Izumi-san's expression darkens the the instant I utter%Nthose words.%K%P

0xFD8
Makoto「Two nights ago, Kurumi suggested going on a 'Mystery%NTour.' You got really mad back then, didn't you?」%K%P

0xFE4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xFF0
Makoto「Why did you get so angry?」%K%P

0x1004
Izumi「Makoto-kun... Weren't you listening? It's because over%Nthere is the God of De-」%K%P

0x1010
Makoto「I don't think that's the only reason.」%K%P

0x101C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1028
Makoto「You're not telling me something, right?」%K%P

0x1034
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1040
Izumi-san's mouth is shut.%K%P

0x104C
It seems I'm not going to make any progress by directly%Nasking.%K%P

0x1058
I'll just have to trick her into confessing...%K

0x1AD8
"I plan to go to the shrine tonight."

0x1AE4
"I know the truth about the God of Demons."

0x1098
Makoto「Izumi-san... the truth is, I was thinking about trying to go%Nto the shrine tonight.」%K%P

0x10A4
I'm bluffing, of course.%K%P

0x10B0
But with this, I should hopefully be able to pry the real%Nreason out of Izumi-san, who will inevitably try to stop me.%K%P

0x10BC
Izumi「Don't! Don't do it, Makoto-kun! You mustn't do it!」%K%P

0x10C8
Makoto「And why is that? I can't agree with you unless you give%Nme a clear reason.」%K%P

0x10DC
Izumi「I told you, that's because...」%K%P

0x10E8
I'll pressure her again.%K%P

0x10F4
Makoto「I'm going... to the shrine.」%K%P

0x1118
Makoto「Izumi-san... I know the truth about the God of Demons.」%K%P

0x1124
Of course, I'm bluffing.%K%P

0x1130
This way, I can get her to think that there's no use hiding%Nthe information, meaning she'll spill the beans.%K%P

0x1144
Izumi「Huh!? You know...!?」%K%P

0x1150
Makoto「Yes...」%K%P

0x115C
Izumi「No way, you know that I made up that story...?」%K%P

0x1168
—Made up!?%K%P

0x1174
—So that means she created the story about the God%Nof Demons!?%K%P

0x1180
Makoto「Yeah, I did...」%K%P

0x118C
I reply nonchalantly.%K%P

0x11A0
Izumi「Is... that so...」%K%P

0x11AC
Makoto「But why does it have to be a lie...?」%K%P

0x11B8
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x11C4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x11D0
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x11DC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x11E8
Izumi「... I understand... Then I'll tell you and you alone...」%K%P

0x11F4
Izumi「But not here. Shall we move to a different place?」%K%P

0x1208
Exactly as planned...%K%P

0x1224
...%K%P

0x1230
But... why do I feel like such an asshole?%K%P

0x123C
Perhaps I might be just as interested in the shrine as%NKurumi is.%K%P

0x12CC
Izumi-san stands on the pier, staring out at the golden%Nsea.%K%P

0x12D8
She softly runs her hand through her soft hair as a%Ngentle breeze strokes it...%K%P

0x12E4
It's clear from her sorrow filled eyes that she's brooding%Nabout something...%K%P

0x12F0
This is beginning to feel like déjà vu.%K%P

0x12FC
I've seen a pair of eyes like that quite recently before,%Neyes full of secrets kept locked away.%K%P

0x1308
Just then, Izumi-san quietly begins to bequeath me%Nthose secrets.%K%P

0x1324
Izumi「Yes. As you know, Makoto-kun... that story was a lie...」%K%P

0x1330
Izumi「But that doesn't mean it's all false.」%K%P

0x133C
Izumi「A lot of people really did go missing at that shrine... that%Nat least is an undeniable fact.」%K%P

0x1348
Izumi「But... I thought that that alone was insufficient...」%K%P

0x135C
Izumi「The story about the God of Demons I told you about on%NMoon Beach...」%K%P

0x1368
Izumi「That bit was of my own fabrication.」%K%P

0x1374
Makoto「A-A fabrication!?」%K%P

0x1380
Izumi「Yes... But of course, it's not like it was all fake.」%K%P

0x138C
Izumi「A lot of people really did go missing at that shrine... that%Nat least is an undeniable fact.」%K%P

0x1398
Izumi「But you know what? I thought that alone was insufficient...」%K%P

0x13A4
Makoto「Insufficient... what do you mean by that?」%K%P

0x13B0
Izumi「I thought that it would be insufficient to keep you all from%Napproaching that shrine.」%K%P

0x13BC
Izumi「If the thought of people going missing was all there was%Nto it, then you all surely would have gone to the shrine...」%K%P

0x13C8
Izumi「So, using the shrine's name, I added what I thought was a%Nplausible folktale to it.」%K%P

0x13D4
Izumi「I didn't care what I did as long as I could emphasize how%Nterrifying the shrine is, even if only a little...」%K%P

0x13E0
Makoto「... Well then... what was the reason for you... not wanting%Nus to approach the shrine?」%K%P

0x13EC
Izumi「I thought if you all went there, then one day, Kurumi would%Ndefinitely decide to explore it...」%K%P

0x13F8
Izumi「She really is very curious, but even she wouldn't think of%Npulling a stupid stunt like going to a dangerous place by%Nherself.」%K%P

0x1404
Makoto「In short, if even we didn't approach the shine, then in the%Nend, Kurumi wouldn't go there either...?」%K%P

0x1410
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x141C
Makoto「So it was all for Kurumi's sake, then...」%K%P

0x1428
Izumi「Honestly, I never ever wanted Kurumi to learn about the%Nshrine's existence...」%K%P

0x1434
Makoto「Kurumi came back earlier than expected from visiting%NSaki at the clinic...」%K%P

0x1440
Makoto「Since you were already in the middle of your story and%Ncouldn't stop there, you had no choice but to tell her as%Nwell...」%K%P

0x144C
Izumi「That's right...」%K%P

0x1458
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1464
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1470
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x147C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x1488
Makoto「Huh? You're still not finished.」%K%P

0x1494
Makoto「I haven't heard the most important part yet.」%K%P

0x14A0
Izumi「You mean why I don't want Kurumi to get near the shrine...%Nright?」%K%P

0x14AC
Makoto「... Yes.」%K%P

0x14B8
Izumi-san runs her hand through her hair again, and%Nsighs deeply.%K%P

0x14C4
It seems as if she's steeling herself for something%Nimportant...%K%P

0x14D0
The anticipation causes my heart to pound loudly...%K%P

0x14DC
I patiently wait for Izumi-san to begin talking again.%K%P

0x14F8
Izumi「The truth is...」%K%P

0x1504
Izumi「... Kurumi... might not be my real sister...」%K%P

0x152C
—What!?%K%P

0x1538
I can't say a word...%K%P

0x1544
I can't even breathe.%K%P

0x1550
(Kurumi... isn't Izumi-san's... sister!?!?!?)%K%P

0x155C
Izumi「Listen carefully...」%K%P

0x1568
Izumi「In the past, Kurumi went missing...」%K%P

0x1574
Izumi「To put it accurately, she was kidnapped...」%K%P

0x1580
Makoto「K-Kidnapped!?」%K%P

0x158C
—And just then!%K%P

0x15CC
Kurumi「Ah! Finally found you...」%K%P

0x15D8
Makoto「Crap...」%K%P

0x15E4
Izumi「K-Kurumi...」%K%P

0x1620
Kurumi「Are you two confessing your love during a romantic%Nsunset?」%K%P

0x162C
Makoto「N-No...」%K%P

0x1638
Kurumi「Then that's fine, but... If we don't hurry back, we won't%Nmake it in time, right?」%K%P

0x1644
Izumi「Huh...?」%K%P

0x1650
Kurumi「For the barbecue!」%K%P

0x165C
Kurumi「If we go back now... hmm... We'll be ten minutes late, right?」%K%P

0x1668
I look at my watch.%K%P

0x1674
"4:40 P.M."—On foot, it's about half an hour from here%Nto Lunabeach...%K%P

0x1680
... Kurumi's right.%K%P

0x168C
Izumi「W-Well then, shall we run back?」%K%P

0x16A0
Kurumi「Kurumi'll be fine, but... won't it be rough on Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x16AC
Kurumi「If he carries that much while running, it's bound to strain%Nhim.」%K%P

0x16B8
Izumi「Th-That's true. Then... let's use a boat!」%K%P

0x16C4
Izumi-san has clearly lost her mind...%K%P

0x16D0
Kurumi「Huh? What are you saying, Onee-chan?」%K%P

0x16DC
Izumi「... W-Well then... what should we do...?」%K%P

0x16E8
Kurumi「Hee hee hee... Kurumi thought something like this would%Nhappen.」%K%P

0x16F4
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x1708
Kurumi「Ta-da♪ It's a KuruKuru Kurumiracle♪」%K%P

0x1714
Kurumi dramatically points towards the fish market.%K%P

0x1720
In that direction is a black car.%K%P

0x172C
Kurumi「Kurumi honorably prepared this taxi for you to accept.」%K%P

0x1738
Makoto「There are taxis... on this island?」%K%P

0x1744
Kurumi「Yeah, but just three of them.」%K%P

0x1750
Kurumi「C'mon, hurry! We've got quite some ground to cover!」%K%P

0x1764
Kurumi pushes Izumi-san and I forward, and we get into%Nthe taxi.%K%P

0x1770
In the end, I never got to hear the rest of Izumi-san's%Nstory.%K%P

0x177C
—Kurumi's kidnapping...%K%P

0x1788
—The reason Izumi-san doesn't want Kurumi to go to%Nthe shrine...%K%P

0x1794
—And the fact that Kurumi may not be Izumi-san's%Nsister...%K%P

0x17A0
Just where is the so-called tangent point between%Nthese three stories?%K%P

0x17AC
Only Izumi-san knows everything...%K%P

0x17E4
Thanks to the taxi, we were able to make it on time to%Nmeet everyone.%K%P

0x17F0
We meet everyone at 5:00 before deciding who would%Ncarry what to Princess Beach.%K%P

0x17FC
Everyone smiles cheerfully...%K%P

0x1808
Amongst all of us, Kurumi is the most enthusiastic.%K%P

0x1814
She's clearly looking forward to the barbecue.%K%P

0x1820
Izumi-san has also completely returned to her usual self.%K%P

0x182C
I'm engulfed in this cheerful atmosphere, and before I%Nknow it, the issue with Kurumi has been buried in the%Ncorners of my mind...%K%P
