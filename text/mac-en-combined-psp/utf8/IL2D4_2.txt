Makoto「Is this everything?」%K%P

0x78
Izumi「Yes. I don't think I've forgotten anything.」%K%P

0x84
We take the bulging shopping bags in our hands and%Nstart walking back towards Lunabeach.%K%P

0x90
Just then, at that time...%K%P

0xE8
Izumi「Ah...」%K%P

0xF4
Makoto「A-An earthquake...?」%K%P

0x100
As soon as I notice the small tremors... I know what's%Ncoming!%K%P

0x16C
—Rumble!%K%P

0x178
The shock waves feel like they're pushing me up...%K%P

0x1B4
We drop our bags and cling to each other as we topple%Nonto the shaking ground.%K%P

0x1C0
Before long, the tremors fade...%K%P

0x210
... Izumi-san and I are still holding on to each other, laying%Non the ground.%K%P

0x224
Izumi「M-Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x230
Izumi-san is shaken up.%K%P

0x23C
However...%K%P

0x264
For some reason, I'm very calm.%K%P

0x270
(There's no way in hell I'll miss this opportunity!)%K%P

0x27C
(Honestly, I'd thought up a time, place, and other plans to%Ndo this, but I don't care anymore!)%K%P

0x288
(Now's... my chance!)%K%P

0x294
I've decided to confess to her.%K%P

0x2A0
Makoto「I... Izumi-san... I...」%K%P

0x2B4
Izumi「... Huh? ...Huh?」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「I-I... Izumi-san, I l...」%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi「!!!」%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「I lo-」%K%P

0x2EC
Izumi「Makoto-kun! Don't!」%K%P

0x308
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x314
Izumi-san is pointing at the edge of the shopping district.%K%P

0x320
When I look in the direction she's pointing...%K%P

0x33C
... I see Okuhiko!%K%P

0x350
(Damn it! Why now...!?)%K%P

0x35C
We quickly get off of each other, gather up our fallen%Nbags, and stand up like nothing happened.%K%P

0x38C
Okuhiko「Huh? Ishihara and Izumi-san? What's up? What are you%Ndoing here?」%K%P

0x398
Makoto「It doesn't concern you!」%K%P

0x3A4
Right now, I'm really pissed off at Okuhiko for getting in%Nmy way.%K%P

0x3B8
Okuhiko「What the hell!? I wasn't asking you, Ishihara!」%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「D-Damn you...」%K%P

0x3E0
Izumi「There, there...」%K%P

0x3EC
Izumi「We were here to shop for the barbecue. We were on our%Nway back when...」%K%P

0x400
Okuhiko「... that earthquake hit. That was really powerful. I wonder%Nhow many times I've experienced it... Oh, no, I was just%Ntalking to myself...」%K%P

0x40C
Okuhiko「Huh? Now that I think about it, earlier...」%K%P

0x420
—Crap!%K%P

0x42C
D-Did he see us!? Did he see Izumi-san and I holding%Neach other!?%K%P

0x440
Okuhiko「I stepped in some dog crap. Here, take a look.」%K%P

0x454
Makoto「I don't need to see it!!」%K%P

0x468
Okuhiko「Huh? Ishihara... that's...」%K%P

0x47C
—Shit!!%K%P

0x488
C-Could I have accidentally gotten a kiss mark on my%Nface from Izumi-san when we were rolling earlier!?%K%P

0x49C
Okuhiko「There's shoes in your shopping bag. Aren't they yours?」%K%P

0x4B0
I quickly take out the shoes and put them back on.%K%P

0x4BC
They fell off during the quake, and I was so frantic in%Ngathering the bags afterwards that I must have put them%Nin by mistake...%K%P

0x4D0
Okuhiko「Huh? Now that I think about it...」%K%P

0x4E4
Wh-What now!?%K%P

0x500
Okuhiko「This event never happened last time... Wait, huh?」%K%P

0x50C
Before Okuhiko can notice anything strange, we quickly%Nget out of the shopping district and leave him behind.%K%P

0x56C
We finally arrive at Lunabeach, and place the bags down.%K%P

0x578
When I was walking, I decided to wait a little bit before%Ntrying to say what I wanted to say to Izumi-san again.%K%P

0x5A8
Makoto「Izumi-san... I want to tell you something.」%K%P

0x5BC
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x5C8
I'll say it this time!%K%P

0x5D4
No matter what, I will definitely say it!%K%P

0x5E0
Makoto「I was interrupted earlier, but...」%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi「... Y-Yes?」%K%P

0x600
Makoto「Izumi-san... I lo-」%K%P

0x624
Izumi「Ah!」%K%P

0x630
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x63C
Izumi「Don't! Hide!」%K%P

0x648
I look towards where Izumi-san is glancing...%K%P

0x680
... and I see Okuhiko!!%K%P

0x68C
He slowly staggers this way while holding his stomach.%K%P

0x698
(Oh for God's sake, why now!? It's still too early for lunch,%Nisn't it!?)%K%P

0x6A4
We quickly hide behind the side of the shop as I conceal%Nmy irritation.%K%N

0x6B0
Okuhiko pulls on the shop's doorknob.%K%N

0x6BC
But it's locked, so it won't open.%K%P

0x6D0
Okuhiko「Huh? Are they still out?」%K%P

0x6E4
Okuhiko「Hee〜y... open up! Anyone here?」%K%P

0x6F0
We wait for an opening, then sneak away.%K%P

0x750
In front of Tsukiya Hotel...%K%P

0x778
I open my mouth again.%K%P

0x784
Makoto「Izumi-san! I want you to listen to me!」%K%P

0x798
Izumi「Huh? ... Sure.」%K%P

0x7A4
Makoto「I... I... Izumi-san, I lo-」%K%P

0x7C8
Izumi「Ah!!」%K%P

0x7D4
Makoto「A-Again!?」%K%P

0x80C
I see Okuhiko staggering towards the hotel from far%Naway, still holding his stomach...%K%P

0x844
Izumi-san and I head into the lobby.%K%N

0x850
There, we hide behind one of the sofas.%K%N

0x85C
Shortly afterwards, Okuhiko enters the hotel.%K%P

0x868
Okuhiko「E-Excuse me... I'd like to ask you for a little favor...」%K%P

0x874
Okuhiko talks to the front desk clerk with a voice that%Nsounds like he's about to die.%K%P

0x880
After talking for several minutes...%K%N

0x88C
... Two muscular men drag him outside.%K%P

0x898
Even so, Okuhiko shows no signs of leaving the front of%Nthe hotel.%K%P

0x8A4
We decide to secretly escape through the back exit.%K%P

0x904
At Viewpoint Park...%K%P

0x934
If we've come this far, then I don't think Okuhiko will come%Nhere.%K%P

0x940
(This time, I will definitely confess to her by all means%Npossible!)%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「Izumi-san! Listen to me!!」%K%P

0x958
I shout, half in desperation.%K%P

0x96C
Izumi-san just gives me a powerful nod in response.%K%P

0x978
Makoto「IZUMI-SAN, I LO-」%K%P

0x99C
Izumi「AH!!!」%K%P

0x9A8
Izumi-san is looking at...%K%P

0x9E0
... I don't even need to check who it is by now.%K%P

0x9EC
Makoto「No... No... No...」%K%P

0x9F8
Makoto「NO MOREEEEEE!!!」%K%P

0xA04
I look at the staggering Okuhiko, and try to break out%Ninto a run.%K%P

0xA10
(I need this bastard to disappear so that I can confess%Nto Izumi-san!!)%K%P

0xA1C
Unable to take much more of this, I clench my hands into%Nfists.%K%P

0xA38
Izumi「Makoto-kun, no! Hide!」%K%P

0xA44
Izumi-san shakes her head and grabs me. She starts to%Ndrag me behind a nearby tree...%K%P

0xA58
I can't see Okuhiko, but I can hear his voice.%K%P

0xA64
Okuhiko「Damn them. Who the hell do they think I am?」%K%P

0xA70
Okuhiko「I'm the son of the Iida Financial Group!」%K%P

0xA7C
Okuhiko「Even so... Even so... they treated me like crap... *sob*」%K%P

0xA88
Okuhiko「I'll have Papa make sure they get eliminated from%Nbusiness world... Absolutely!」%K%P

0xA94
Okuhiko「Ah... but anyway, where... where's the bathroom...?」%K%P

0xAA0
Okuhiko「If this was how it was going to be... then I should have%Nnever eaten those damn rice balls...」%K%P

0xAAC
Okuhiko「...」%K%P

0xAC8
Huh?%K%N

0xAD4
I can't hear Okuhiko's voice.%K%N

0xAE0
Is he gone?%K%P

0xAEC
When I try to peek my face out from behind the tree...%K%P

0xB1C
Okuhiko「... Why... Why... are they in the middle of cleaning it now...?」%K%P

0xB28
Okuhiko「At this rate... I'll just go behind that tree...」%K%P

0xB34
(D-Dumbass! You're the son of a financial group, so don't%Ntake care of your business outside!!)%K%P

0xB40
Okuhiko walks this way.%K%P

0xB78
We desperately run away...%K%P

0xB84
(Why!? Why the hell does Okuhiko have to keep getting in%Nmy way!?)%K%P

0xB90
... ... ...%K%P

0xB9C
In the end, Izumi-san and I just keep running from place%Nto place until just before the barbecue...%K%P
