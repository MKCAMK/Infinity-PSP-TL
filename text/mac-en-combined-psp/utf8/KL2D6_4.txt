Moon Beach...%K%N

0x34
There's no one here...%K%P

0x40
Why did I come back here...?%K%P

0x4C
Kurumi「You were looking for jellyfish in a place like this?」%K%P

0x58
Kurumi「... Do you like jellyfish?」%K%P

0x64
Kurumi「Wow〜. Then you're the same as Kurumi.」%K%P

0x70
Back then...%K%N

0x7C
On the night of the 1st... Kurumi...%K%P

0x88
Kurumi「Well, you see, there's something that Kurumi forgot to tell%NOkuhiko-kun...」%K%P

0x94
Kurumi「Nope. Kurumi already did that, so its fine.」%K%P

0xB0
My head was lowered the whole time... so I didn't notice%NKurumi was there...%K%P

0xBC
It can't be...%K%N

0xC8
Back then, did Kurumi pick it up... before I could find it...?%K%P

0x150
That "bell"...%K%P

0x1E8
Impossible...%K%N

0x1F4
That's impossible...%K%P

0x200
I violently shake my head to shake off that delusion.%K%N

0x20C
Now isn't the time to be thinking about that.%K%P

0x218
(Anyway, finding Kurumi comes first...)%K%P

0x224
I raise my legs again.%K%N

0x230
They're already numb...%K%P

0x244
The hotel...%K%P

0x258
The shopping district...%K%P

0x26C
The pier...%K%P

0x280
She's nowhere to be found...%K%P

0x28C
I've wandered all around the island, searching for Kurumi...%K%P

0x298
I drag along both my feet, which I can't really feel%Nanymore...%K%P

0x36C
I've ended up returning here.%K%N

0x378
In the end, I was unable to find Kurumi.%K%P

0x384
Izumi「The truth is...」%K%P

0x390
Izumi「... Kurumi... might not be my real sister...」%K%P

0x39C
(Why did she say that...?)%K%P

0x3A8
("Kurumi is my real sister"—if you had just thought%Nthat, then... dammit!)%K%P

0x3B4
I find myself looking at my watch as I come to my senses.%K%P

0x3C0
("6 SAT 4:20 A.M.")%K%P

0x3CC
There's no more time to search.%K%N

0x3D8
There's no other choice but to ambush her at the shrine.%K%P

0x3E4
No, she might even be there already.%K%P

0x3F0
I begin to walk towards the shrine...%K%P

0x4A4
It took me longer than I expected to get there.%K%P

0x4B0
In the deep darkness, the shrine stands out like%Nsomething faintly white against a dark background.%K%P

0x4BC
The raindrops pelting the roof become a thin mist that%Nenvelops the shrine.%K%P

0x4C8
Its faint and gray appearance makes it look like a mirage.%K%P

0x4D4
It's the exact same scene as that day.%K%P

0x4E0
The ground is violently pounded by swarms of large rain%Ndrops...%K%N

0x4EC
The world is dominated by the sound of rainfall...%K%N

0x4F8
My body is soaking wet, chilled to the bone.%K%P

0x504
I can barely move my cold body.%K%P

0x510
I move stiffly, staggering through the deep water%Npuddle...%K%P

0x5AC
In the darkness of the dreary shrine... I don't see Kurumi.%K%N

0x5B8
In pain, I sit down by the entrance.%K%P

0x5C4
I firmly stare at the shrine's grounds, hazy from the rain.%K%N

0x5D0
I draw my body close, and shiver as I try to warm up.%K%P

0x5DC
(Kurumi...)%K%P

0x5E8
Kurumi will definitely come here.%K%N

0x5F4
But when she does, just what should I do...? I think about%Nit.%K%P

0x600
Healing her scar...%K%N

0x60C
Removing her emotional scars...%K%P

0x618
(If I can make her believe me about her blood%Nrelationship with Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x624
Kurumi definitely time traveled here from this shrine.%K%P

0x630
(Time travel —just how the hell can I prove that?)%K%P

0x63C
I continue to wait for Kurumi while watching the white%Nraindrops flow down from the edge of the eaves...%K%P

0x6B8
The rain is still strong... it hasn't weakened one bit.%K%N

0x6C4
A deep, thick fog rises around the shrine's grounds.%K%P

0x6D0
In that snow white fog, a faint, small figure appears...%K%P

0x6F8
Countless raindrops crash against the figure's thin%Narms and soft hair.%K%N

0x704
It seems as if as if the figure's body is wrapped in a%Nband of holy light.%K%P

0x710
The completely soaking wet girl totters forward, her%Nhead hung downwards.%K%P

0x71C
She hasn't noticed me yet.%K%P

0x728
And then, when she reaches the dead center of the%Nlong stone paving...%K%N

0x734
... I stand up.%K%P

0x7D8
I walk towards the girl in the downpour...%K%N

0x7E4
There's no pain in my legs. I don't feel the cold, icy air.%K%N

0x7F0
The rain seems to disappear...%K%P

0x7FC
All I do is stare at the girl while I slowly make my way%Ntowards her.%K%P

0x808
... Suddenly, the girl raises her head.%K%N

0x814
When she sees me, her small mouth drops open.%K%P

0x820
She stands stock still, looking at me in awe.%K%P

0x82C
I gradually begin to close the distance between us...%K%N

0x838
The girl's figure approaches...%K%N

0x844
And...%K

0x850
... she stands before my eyes.%K%P

0x898
I stand... right in front of Kurumi.%K%P

0x8A4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8B0
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8C8
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x8D4
But I can't speak.%K%P

0x8E0
I don't know what to say.%K%P

0x8EC
No matter how I explain it, I don't think Kurumi will believe%Nme about the time travel.%K%P

0x8F8
(Then what...)%K%P

0x904
(What should I do...?)%K%P

0x910
Kurumi「Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x91C
Kurumi「Onii-chan... that's enough...」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x934
Kurumi「Kurumi has to confirm it for herself...」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「Confirm? Confirm... what?」%K%P

0x94C
Kurumi「This shrine... What kind of connection does Kurumi have%Nto this shrine...?」%K%P

0x958
Kurumi「Onii-chan, it has nothing to do with you...」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「That's not true at all!」%K%P

0x978
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x984
Kurumi doesn't answer.%K%P

0x998
Kurumi silently pushes me aside, and starts walking.%K%N

0x9A4
She's heading... towards the shrine...%K%P

0x9B0
Makoto「... KURUMI, WAIT!!!」%K%P

0x9BC
I start to reach out for her shoulder.%K%N

0x9C8
But I've lost all power in my arms, so they just slip on her%Nshoulders and fall down.%K%P

0x9D4
(Fuck... at this rate...!!!)%K%P

0x9E0
In contrast to my burning emotions, my body is frozen%Nbeyond words.%K%N

0x9EC
Nevertheless, I try to grab the walking Kurumi's back to%Nstop her, but...%K%P

0xA0C
... In that instant, Kurumi starts running.%K%P

0xA60
Grabbing onto nothing but thin air, I fall into the water.%K%P

0xA6C
Makoto「KURUMI!!!」%K%P

0xA78
I strain my voice, but Kurumi doesn't even turn around.%K%P

0xA84
Even though I try stretching my arm as far as I can,%Nthere's no way I grab that running, retreating figure.%K%P

0xA90
I try pushing off the ground, but I don't have the%Nstrength to get up.%K%N

0xA9C
In the puddle, I do my best to crawl after Kurumi's shadow.%K%P

0xAA8
Time ruthlessly passes by...%K%N

0xAB4
Before long, Kurumi rushes into the shrine.%K%P

0xAC0
The instant she runs in...%K%P

0xADC
... ... ... ...%K%P

0xAF0
Kurumi「Onii-chan...」%K%P

0xAFC
Everything is the same as that day.%K%P

0xC24
The mountain of rubble...%K%N

0xC30
Still crawling, I claw my way up the mountain of rubble.%K%P

0xC3C
As I remove a heavy plank, my nails tear off...%K%P

0xC68
Kurumi...%K%P

0xC74
Looking at Kurumi's ghastly pale, almost transparent%Ncheeks, I feel like she might shatter into a thousand%Npieces if I touched her cheek.%K%P

0xC80
As if she were a doll made of glass...%K%N

0xC9C
Her heavily dangling palm is clutching onto a small%Nfragment of light.%K%P

0xCA8
—The bell.%K%N

0xCB4
It's that bell...%K%P

0xCC0
That cold, silver light... That dull, crimson string...%K%P

0xCCC
Before long, the bell begins to quietly slip out of the%Npalm...%K%P

0xCD8
... It then... slips out and falls.%K%P

0xD3C
All light fades.%K%N

0xD48
There's not even a single streak of light shining in this%Ndarkness...%K%N

0xD54
... I've lost everything...%K%P
