As I wake up, I kick the covers off the bed with all my%Nstrength.%K%P

0xAC
Still half asleep, I blankly stare into space.%K%P

0xB8
A familiar... ceiling...?%K%P

0xC4
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0xD0
This is my room in the lodge.%K%P

0xDC
What the hell's going on?%K%P

0xE8
Just seconds ago, I was outside. I was right next to%NIzumi-san.%K%P

0xF4
Was it a dream...? No, that's impossible.%K%P

0x100
My memory is clear about what happened... But if that%Nwas a dream, then maybe I'm still dreaming now.%K%P

0x10C
Just then... a thought hits me.%K%P

0x118
(After I lost consciousness, someone might have found%Nme and brought me back here.)%K%P

0x124
I force my languid body to move, and check the time on%Nmy watch.%K%P

0x130
(1 MON 8:47 A.M.)%K%P

0x13C
It's morning... huh. I slept pretty well...%K%P

0x148
...%K%P

0x154
... Huh?%K%P

0x160
I frantically check my watch one more time.%K%P

0x17C
(1 MON 8:47 A.M.)%K%P

0x1A4
... My eyes aren't deceiving me.%K%P

0x1B0
From what I can see, according to my watch, today is%Nunmistakably April 1st.%K%P

0x1BC
I shift my eyes towards the window.%K%N

0x1C8
If my memories are correct, then the weather is certainly%Nthe same as it was on the day I woke up from that%Nnightmare.%K%P

0x1D4
I'm still half asleep, but... I must have...%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「Time traveled...!」%K%P

0x1EC
I blurt out my thoughts.%K%P

0x1F8
Impossible! I can't accept this way of thinking.%K%P

0x204
And... and besides...%K%N

0x210
It doesn't change the fact that I failed to protect%NIzumi-san!%K%P

0x21C
Once again, despair and intense rage well up inside me.%K%P

0x228
My nails dig into my palm as I clench my hand tightly.%K%N

0x234
My lips start to bleed as I bite them hard.%K%P

0x240
But then I rethink the situation.%K%P

0x24C
"Before getting depressed or punishing myself, I have%Nto confirm this!"%K%P

0x258
Did I really time travel...?%K%N

0x264
If not, then why was I brought back here...?%K%P

0x270
What happened to Izumi-san...?%K%P

0x27C
I get out of my bed and try to head to the living room.%K%P

0x298
—And at that time!%K%P

0x2C0
The door to my room is violently thrown open with enough%Nforce to break it.%K%P

0x2CC
Oh, that's right. Of course that would happen.%K%P

0x2D8
If I've really time traveled, then this was going to happen.%K%P

0x2E4
I slowly shift my gaze to the one who opened the door.%K%P

0x2F0
Standing there, I see...%K%N

0x2FC
I see...%K%P

0x310
... Izumi-san?%K%P

0x338
Makoto「A-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!」%K%P

0x540
I scream, and fall back down on my bed.%K%P

0x54C
I'm thrown into a state of confusion by this%Nincomprehensible situation.%K%P

0x558
W... Why...? Why is Izumi-san here?%K%P

0x564
It's no longer a problem of whether I've time traveled or%Nnot. This is a paradox!%K%P

0x570
If I really time traveled, then I shouldn't be acquainted%Nwith Izumi-san yet!%K%P

0x57C
But if I didn't time travel, then Izumi-san should be dead!%K%P

0x5A4
Izumi-san shuts the door behind her, and approaches%Nme.%K%P

0x5B0
Makoto「A... ah...」%K%P

0x5BC
I step back in order to get as far away from Izumi-san as%Npossible.%K%P

0x5C8
However, there's nowhere to run, and Izumi-san slowly%Napproaches to close the distance between us.%K%P

0x5D4
Makoto「G-Ghost...」%K%P

0x5E0
My voice is trembling like the heroine in some B-horror%Nmovie.%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi-san approaches me as close as possible, and%Nthen starts to restrain me.%K%P

0x600
Makoto「AAH... Mmph!」%K%P

0x60C
I try to scream again, but Izumi-san covers my mouth, as%NI squirm in place.%K%P

0x628
Izumi「Calm down, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x634
Izumi「All right? Just calm down and listen to me.」%K%P

0x640
Izumi-san talks in a gentle, yet authoritative voice that%Nleaves no room for denial.%K%P

0x64C
I nod, but Izumi-san still keeps her hand over my mouth.%K%P

0x660
Izumi「First of all... today is not April 1st, but April 7th.」%K%P

0x66C
Makoto「!?」%K%P

0x678
Izumi「The truth is...」%K%P

0x684
And then, Izumi-san begins to explain.%K%P

0x698
...%K%P

0x6C0
On that day, it seems that Izumi-san only fainted when%Nshe fell from the cliff.%K%P

0x6CC
When I followed suit, Okuhiko and the others found us%Nand took us back to the lodge.%K%P

0x6D8
In other words, I've been asleep for a whole day.%K%P

0x6E4
But the most surprising thing is that Okuhiko has started%Nto try to deceive me again!%K%P

0x6F0
As for exactly what he's up to, according to Izumi-san,%Nit's something like this.%K%P

0x6FC
...%K%P

0x708
Okuhiko and the others chased after us, and found us%Ncollapsed at the bottom of the cliff.%K%P

0x714
Izumi-san woke up shortly afterwards, but I wouldn't wake%Nup at all.%K%P

0x720
When they brought me back to the lodge, they had%Ncalled a doctor to examine me... but it wasn't serious.%K%P

0x72C
It seems I had lost consciousness due to strain and%Nmental shock, and I'd wake up by the next morning.%K%P

0x738
But Okuhiko took this chance to come up with an%Ninteresting idea.%K%P

0x744
The group would pretend it was April 1st once more, and%Nrepeat the same things they did that day.%K%P

0x750
And so, he changed the date on my watch yesterday%Nwhile I was unconscious so that it would read "April 1st"%Ntoday.%K%P

0x75C
But Izumi-san could no longer stand continuing to%Ndeceive me, and so decided to secretly tell me%Neverything... that's how it is.%K%P

0x768
...%K%P

0x774
Also, it seems Izumi-san had a justifiable reason to%Ndeceive me.%K%P

0x780
To put it simply, she was threatened by Okuhiko.%K%P

0x78C
"If you don't obey me, then I'll reveal Kurumi-chan's%Nsecret."%K%P

0x798
That's how it went down.%K%P

0x7A4
(Kurumi's secret???)%K%P

0x7B0
I'm curious, but Izumi-san doesn't tell me.%K%P

0x7CC
But I can let that matter go for now.%K%P

0x7D8
More importantly than anything else, I can't help but feel%Nintense hatred towards the cowardly Okuhiko.%K%P

0x7E4
Makoto「Okuhiko, you bastard...!」%K%P

0x7F0
I need to get even with him, no matter what!!%K%P

0x820
Izumi「Hey. If you want revenge, then how about this?」%K%P

0x82C
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x838
Izumi「Why not turn Okuhiko's plan against him, and deceive him%Nusing the same trick!?」%K%P

0x844
In other words, she's saying "After Okuhiko wakes up,%Nwe'll act like it's April 1st."%K%P

0x850
Makoto「Izumi-san, that's brilliant! You're a genius!」%K%P

0x864
Izumi「Hee hee hee... aren't I?」%K%P

0x870
Izumi-san laughs impishly.%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「... All right. Then let's wake everyone up immediately and%Nbegin mobilizing them!」%K%P

0x888
Makoto「Heh heh heh... Payback's a bitch, Okuhiko.」%K%P
