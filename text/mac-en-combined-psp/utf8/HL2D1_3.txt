... Before long, I arrive at Princess Beach.%K%P

0xC8
The wrecked ship washed up on the shore...%K%N

0xD4
Haruka is sitting on the bow of the ship, firmly staring at%Nthe ocean. Her soft hair sways in the sea breeze.%K%P

0xE0
I'm unable to move, as if my soul had been drained from%Nmy body.%K%N

0xEC
"You mustn't get any closer."%K%N

0xF8
... It feels like someone's saying that to me.%K%P

0x11C
Haruka suddenly looks my way. Our eyes meet.%K%P

0x128
Haruka「... Why?」%K%P

0x134
Haruka mutters this.%K%P

0x140
Haruka「Why are you here?」%K%P

0x14C
Makoto「I... followed you here.」%K%P

0x158
Haruka「Why?」%K%P

0x164
Makoto「... Because I was worried about you.」%K%P

0x170
Haruka「You don't really need to worry about me...」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x188
Haruka「Because I'm different...」%K%P

0x194
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x1A0
Haruka「Because I'm different, it's fine...」%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「Haruka...%K don't say that...%K If you stay like this, then in five%Ndays...」%K%P

0x1B8
At that time...%K%P

0x1C4
Yuka「Makoto! Haruka! Where are you...!?」%K%P

0x1D0
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan...!」%K%P

0x1DC
... I hear Yuka and Okuhiko's voices in the distance.%K%P

0x1E8
I turn around to find small human figures walking down the%Ncoastline road.%K%P

0x1F4
Haruka also seems to have noticed them.%K%N

0x200
She quickly hides in the shade of the ship...%K%P

0x214
I follow her lead and hide behind the boat.%K%P

0x24C
... ... ...%K%P

0x258
Several minutes later... Yuka and Okuhiko's voices%Ndisappear.%K%P

0x26C
Haruka「It seems they've gone.」%K%P

0x278
Haruka places her hand on my shoulder.%K%P

0x28C
When I nod, she steps out from her hiding place, and%Nstarts walking towards the beach.%K%P

0x2C4
As she walks on the sand, she takes off her shoes and%Nsocks.%K%P

0x2D0
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0x2E4
Haruka「What?」%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2FC
Haruka「Did you think I was going to strip naked?」%K%P

0x308
Makoto「N-No...」%K%P

0x340
Haruka nonchalantly soaks her bare feet into the%Nocean. Her eyes are fixed on the faraway horizon.%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「... I just wanted to ask why you ran away from Yuka and%NOkuhiko.」%K%P

0x358
Haruka「I prefer being alone...」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「Alone...? But that just... sounds too lonely, doesn't it...?」%K%P

0x370
Haruka「Lonely? What is?」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「Thinking something like 'I prefer being alone'...」%K%P

0x388
Haruka「I don't understand...」%K%P

0x394
Haruka「Because I... am nothing.」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Because you have no heart...?」%K%P

0x3AC
I say this.%K%N

0x3B8
Taken aback, Haruka turns to face me.%K%N

0x3C4
A distinctly disturbed expression rises to her face.%K%P

0x3D0
Haruka「That's right... I have no...」%K%P

0x3DC
Haruka hesitates midspeech.%K%P

0x3E8
Haruka「How?」%K%P

0x3F4
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x400
Haruka「How did you...?」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「I knew. I know a lot about you...」%K%P

0x418
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x434
Haruka firmly stares at me.%K%P

0x474
I spontaneously embrace Haruka. I wrap my arms tightly%Naround her, holding her close...%K%P

0x480
Haruka「... That hurts.」%K%P

0x48C
I frantically loosen my embrace at those words.%K%P

0x4A0
Makoto「S-Sorry... I was just so...」%K%P

0x4AC
Haruka「'So'... What's the rest?」%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「... happy. So happy... that I got to see you again.」%K%P

0x4C4
Haruka「What do you mean?」%K%P

0x4D0
Makoto「No... I doubt you'd believe me even if I told you...」%K%P

0x4DC
Makoto「The reason doesn't matter. Anyway, it's because I'm%Nhappy...」%K%P

0x4E8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x510
Haruka's stare almost feels like it hurts.%K%N

0x51C
Her eyes are filled with curiosity.%K%N

0x528
Complex feelings of bafflement mixed with expectation%Nappear in those eyes.%K%P

0x534
And then, Haruka suddenly speaks.%K%P

0x540
Haruka「Have you ever kissed someone?」%K%P

0x54C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x558
Haruka「Have you?」%K%P

0x564
(What's going on!? This is definitely... definitely...)%K%P

0x570
I become flustered from Haruka's unexpected question.%K%P

0x57C
The answer that comes out of my mouth is...%K

0xFD8
"Of course."

0xFE4
"O-Once..."

0x5C4
Makoto「Of course.」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「O-Once...」%K%P

0x5E4
... That's my answer.%K%N

0x5F0
I certainly did kiss her on the forehead back then.%K%N

0x5FC
On that afternoon... on the day Haruka and I went fishing%Ntogether...%K%P

0x608
Makoto「But you know, you shouldn't really ask something like%Nthat.」%K%P

0x614
Haruka「Is... that right?」%K%P

0x620
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x62C
Haruka「Then why do people kiss?」%K%P

0x638
Makoto「It's to demonstrate their love and confirm their feelings%Nfor each other.」%K%P

0x644
Haruka「Confirm...?」%K%P

0x650
Makoto「That's right...」%K%P

0x65C
Haruka「Then... let's kiss.」%K%P

0x668
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x674
Haruka「Let's kiss.」%K%P

0x690
Haruka draws her face close to mine. Her expression%Nbegins to overwhelm my senses.%K%P

0x69C
For some reason, the event that was supposed to%Nhappen in two days is starting now...%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「B-But... I can't kiss you for a reason like that.」%K%P

0x6B4
I repeat the same words as last time.%K%P

0x6C0
Haruka「Then does that mean you don't feel any affection for me,%NMakoto...?」%K%P

0x6CC
Makoto「No! That's not it!」%K%P

0x6D8
I vigorously declare this.%K%N

0x6E4
The feelings of affection I have towards Haruka now are%Nso much greater than they were at our last kiss that%Nthere's no way to compare the difference between them.%K%P

0x6F0
Haruka「... Well then...」%K%P

0x70C
Makoto「All right, I understand. Well then, close your eyes.」%K%P

0x720
Haruka quietly shuts her eyes.%K%P

0x72C
I stare at her face.%K Haruka's cheeks quiver like jelly from%Nnervousness.%K Her beckoning small lips glisten.%K%P

0x738
I gently kiss Haruka on the forehead.%K It was just a peck%Nand lasted for only an moment.%K%P

0x744
For some reason, I feel embarrassed, and quickly draw%Nback.%K%P

0x758
Haruka's eyes snap open as she stares at me.%K%P

0x788
Haruka「This is...?」%K%P

0x794
When I return Haruka's gaze, a faint blush appears on%Nher cheeks.%K%P

0x7A0
I am completely captivated by her eyes.%K%P

0x7C8
The cold waves loudly splash against our feet.%K%P

0x7D4
Haruka's cheeks are bathed in sunlight.%K%N

0x7E0
The sea breeze begins to gently blow in the space%Nbetween us...%K%P

0x7EC
―I wonder how long I've been watching Haruka like%Nthis.%K%P

0x7F8
(For Haruka's sake alone, I will live through these next%Nsix days.)%K%P

0x804
I think this over and over again.%K%P

0x810
I will never let Haruka say she has "no heart" ever again.%K%N

0x81C
Because Haruka is her own person...%K%P

0x8B0
... Afterwards, I once again decide to let everything%Nhappen exactly the way it did before.%K%N%N

0x8BC
Our meeting with Kurumi, Izumi-san, and Saki...%K%N

0x8C8
Buying the rice...%K%N

0x8D4
Our dinner of paella...%K%N

0x8E0
Going to the pool late at night...%K%N

0x8EC
And the earthquake...%K%P

0x8F8
Every single thing is a repeat of the events I%Nexperienced in the past.%K%P

0x90C
It's like watching a scene from a recording replay in front%Nof me... it's rather surreal.%K%N%N

0x918
It's not just the events... I think I'm unconsciously%Nrepeating my own actions too.%K%P

0x99C
Right now, I'm on the open terrace in Lunabeach.%K%N

0x9A8
We're all excited after the pool incident, discussing%Nwhether or not to go to the pool tomorrow.%K%P

0x9B4
Since I already know what the final verdict is going to be,%NI stare off into space as I tune out of the conversation.%K%P

0x9C0
Just... what am I?%K%N

0x9CC
Even though I have memories of the future, everything%Nelse is exactly the way it was from the past, including my%Nbody and surroundings.%K%P

0x9D8
I think as hard as I can, but I can't figure out how it's%Npossible. Maybe I've just gone nuts...%K%P

0x9FC
Yuka「Diving?」%K%P

0xA08
I hear Yuka's conspicuously high voice.%K%N

0xA14
I stop thinking and focus on the conversation.%K%P

0xA28
Okuhiko「Yeah. There seems to be a place in the shopping district%Nwhere you can rent scuba gear...」%K%P

0xA44
Izumi「You can't, Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0xA58
Okuhiko「Huh, why not? I've already got my license, if that's what%Nyou're worried about.」%K%P

0xA64
Izumi「That's not it. It's because there'll be high waves%Ntomorrow.」%K%P

0xA78
Okuhiko「Waves?」%K%P

0xA8C
Izumi「Right. There's an unseasonable tropical cyclone coming%Nin from the south, so it seems the waves will be high%Ntomorrow.」%K%P

0xA98
Izumi「I heard about it from Gen-san, the fisherman, so there's%Nno doubt about it.」%K%P

0xAA4
Izumi「He complained that he wouldn't be able to go out to sea%Nand fish because of the storm.」%K%P

0xAB0
Izumi「Also, because this cyclone's migration velocity is slow,%Nit'll be like this for about a week.」%K%P

0xAD8
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0xAE4
... This is horrible.%K%N

0xAF0
I can't believe I forgot about something so important.%K%P

0xAFC
Taking Haruka and escaping the island...%K%N

0xB08
That was supposed to be my last resort.%K%P

0xB14
Makoto「Izumi-san... if that's true, then does that mean the ferry%Nwon't go...?」%K%P

0xB28
Izumi「That's only natural. Until the sea calms down, service will%Nbe suspended.」%K%P

0xB34
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB50
Yuka「What's wrong, Makoto?」%K%P

0xB64
Yuka「Geez, it's all right♪ If it's only for about a week, then it%Nshould be up and running again by the time the Camp%Nends, right?」%K%P

0xB70
Makoto「Y-Yeah... you're right...」%K%P

0xB8C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xBA0
Okuhiko「What's wrong, Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0xBAC
Haruka「He's acting strange...」%K%P

0xBC0
Okuhiko「Huh? ... You mean Ishihara? Don't worry about him. He's%Nalways strange...」%K%P

0xBD4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xBE0
Haruka looks at me with concern. I return it with a%Nreassuring smile.%K%P

0xBFC
(Yes, I'm all right... Even if I can't leave the island, I'll get%Nthrough this somehow! Because this time, I have my%Nmemories!)%K%P

0xC08
(So don't worry, Haruka... You have nothing to worry%Nabout...)%K%P

0xC7C
Before long, the time has come for us to return to the%Nlodge.%K%N

0xC88
We walk down Moon Beach.%K Like last time, we've decided%Nto return by walking down the beach.%K%P

0xCBC
... Suddenly, I stop walking.%K%N

0xCC8
I've just remembered something.%K%P

0xCD4
(That's right... it was definitely around here that I found%Nthat "bell"...)%K%P

0xCFC
I check my surroundings.%K%N

0xD08
At the beach, there's a group of lights coming from sea%Nfireflies.%K%P

0xD14
But unlike that time, I can't find it... That radiance lying in%Nthe beach...%K%PThat cold, stinging light.%K%P

0xD20
(Is it not here? No, that's impossible.)%K%P

0xD2C
(Then can history change...?)%K%P

0xD38
... The changes are slight, but I feel as if this history is a%Nlittle different than the last one.%K%N

0xD44
For example, Haruka and I kissed two days earlier than%Nexpected...%K%P

0xD50
But thanks to that, I'm able to feel a sense of security.%K%P

0xD5C
That small change will mutate into a large alteration of%Nhistory...%K%P

0xD68
(Because I never found the bell, I never threw it away.%NThat means that Haruka also shouldn't be able to get it!)%K%P

0xD74
I no longer feel hesitant...%K%P
