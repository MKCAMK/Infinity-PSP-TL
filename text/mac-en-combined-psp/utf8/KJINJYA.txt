... We arrive in front of an incredibly long flight of%Nmoss-covered stone steps.%K%P

0x80
Makoto「This is it...?」%K%P

0x94
Kurumi「C'mon, hurry up♪」%K%P

0xA0
Kurumi grabs my hand, and tries to drag me up the stairs.%K%P

0xAC
Makoto「H-H-H-Hold on, Kurumi!」%K%P

0xB8
Makoto「Could it be that this place is...」%K%P

0xC4
Kurumi「Right! This is the 'Shiki no Mori' Onee-chan mentioned in%Nher story yesterday!」%K%P

0xD0
Kurumi boldly declares this.%K%P

0xDC
Kurumi「Well? This an interesting place, isn't it?」%K%P

0xE8
Makoto「W-Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in it...」%K%P

0xF4
Kurumi「Right? So hurry up and let's go.」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「But yesterday, Izumi-san said specifically not to go%Nhere, didn't she...?」%K%P

0x10C
Kurumi「It's fine! Onee-chan's just a scaredy cat, that's all!」%K%P

0x118
Kurumi「It's stupid to believe in an old legend... A superstition is%Nnothing more than superstition, after all.」%K%P

0x124
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x130
Kurumi「Huh? ... Don't tell Kurumi that even you believe that story%Nabout 'The God of Demons'...?」%K%P

0x13C
Makoto「It's not like I really believe it. It's just...」%K%P

0x148
Kurumi「Then let's go!」%K%P

0x154
Kurumi tugs at my arm again.%K%P

0x160
Makoto「W-Wait! We shouldn't be so rash!」%K%P

0x16C
Kurumi「... Then we'll wait, but only for a minute.」%K%P

0x178
One minute... that sounds like something a child would%Nsay...%K%P

0x184
But for now, I'll humor her.%K%P

0x190
In that short period of time, I try to make my decision.%K%P

0x19C
―Should I go? ―Or should I not?%K%P

0x1A8
It's not like I completely believe Izumi-san's story, but%Nthat's not the real part that bothers me.%K%P

0x1B4
It's that Izumi-san was incredibly threatening last night.%K%P

0x1C0
She had a furious tone, as if she were intimidating us by%Nsaying "You must never go to that shrine!"...%K%P

0x1CC
Now that I remember it, it feels like those words weren't%Naimed towards me and the rest of the Seminar members,%Nbut rather just Kurumi.%K%P

0x1D8
In other words, Izumi-san doesn't want Kurumi to go to%Nthe shrine, no matter what...%K%P

0x1E4
Is it because it's dangerous? Was it because Izumi-san%Ndoesn't want to put her beloved little sister in danger?%K%P

0x1F0
... I can't figure out a clear reason.%K%P

0x1FC
But at any rate, if Kurumi goes up to the shrine now, it%Nmight feel like I'm betraying Izumi-san.%K%P

0x208
What should I do...?%K

0xE00
Go.

0xE0C
Don't go.

0x250
Makoto「... All right. Since you're so set on this, let's go together.」%K%P

0x25C
I give her this answer.%K%P

0x268
Kurumi「Yay!♪ That's the spirit!」%K%P

0x274
Makoto「But on one condition.」%K%P

0x280
Kurumi「What's that?」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「You must absolutely... not tell Izumi-san that we went to%Nthe shrine!」%K%P

0x298
Kurumi「Kyahaha! What, that's all it was...?」%K%P

0x2A4
Kurumi「You didn't have to say anything! Kurumi wasn't gonna tell%Nher in the first place!」%K%P

0x2B0
Kurumi「It's because of last night. After you and the others left,%NKurumi thought she'd try asking Onee-chan to tell the%Nstory of the shrine once more in detail...」%K%P

0x2BC
Kurumi「But when Kurumi did that, Onee-chan got angry, though%Nnot as much as she was back on Moon Beach...」%K%P

0x2C8
Kurumi「Even so, Kurumi won't say anything. Not even if she's%Nbeing held at gunpoint...」%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「No, it's fine, I trust you won't...」%K%P

0x2E0
Kurumi「Well then, those things don't matter, so let's hurry up and%Ngo, okay?」%K%P

0x2EC
Kurumi urges me on, and we begin to climb up the long%Nstaircase.%K%P

0x324
... Shortly afterwards, the two of us are standing at the%Ntop of the staircase, staring at the infamous shrine.%K%P

0x330
Every part of the shrine, from the outer walls, pillars, and%Neven the large roof, have rotted away extensively,%Nprobably due to many years of being subjected to the%Nsea breeze.%K%P

0x33C
I wouldn't be surprised if it collapsed this very second...%K%P

0x348
Nevertheless, despite its decrepit appearance, the%Nbuilding being bathed with moonlight still gives off the%Nimpression of being surrounded by an imposing air.%K%P

0x354
It's an intimidating atmosphere that feels like it could%Nscare off anyone who tried to trespass on this ground.%K%P

0x360
Kurumi「Hey, wanna try going in?」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「S-Sure...」%K%P

0x378
We've already come this far, so we can't turn back.%K%P

0x384
Kurumi and I walk across the stone paving towards the%Nshrine.%K%P

0x390
We're still holding each other's hands.%K%P

0x3A4
Kurumi「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x3B0
Makoto「Yeah?」%K%P

0x3BC
Kurumi「If... If by any chance, something happens to Kurumi...」%K%P

0x3C8
Kurumi「... Onii-chan, will you save her?」%K%P

0x3D4
Makoto「From what...?」%K%P

0x3E8
Kurumi「Hmm... for example, ah, got it...」%K%P

0x3F4
Kurumi「For example, what if that God of Demons appears in the%Nshrine and tries to grab Kurumi?」%K

0xE18
I'd save you.

0xE24
I wouldn't save you.

0x43C
Makoto「Of course I'd save you.」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「Don't ask me something so obvious...」%K%P

0x45C
Kurumi「Eheh♪」%K%P

0x468
Kurumi smiles happily.%K%P

0x47C
Makoto「If that happened, then there's no way I could save you,%Nright?」%K%P

0x488
Makoto「My first priority would be protecting myself...」%K%P

0x49C
Kurumi「... Huh?」%K%P

0x4A8
A sad look appears in Kurumi's eyes.%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「I-Idiot... I'm kidding!」%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「Don't take it seriously!」%K%P

0x4CC
Kurumi「... Were you really... kidding?」%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「Isn't that obvious? If anything happened, I would risk my%Nlife to save you, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x4E4
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x4F0
The troubled look in Kurumi's eyes has cleared away.%K%P

0x530
... Before long, we arrive at the front of the shrine.%K%P

0x53C
For some reason, I can feel a lukewarm breeze coming%Nfrom the shrine.%K%P

0x548
It's as if it's the sigh of someone trying to tempt us to go%Nin.%K%P

0x55C
Kurumi「Well then, shall we... go in?」%K%P

0x568
And then, in the instant Kurumi mutters this!%K%P

0x574
??「HEY!!!」%K%P

0x588
―A shout that could pierce the darkness breaks out%Nlike a roar!%K%P

0x594
??「Who the hell are you damn kids!!!?」%K%P

0x5A0
Startled, we look around us, but we can't find the owner%Nof the voice which has caused even the surrounding%Ntrees to shake.%K%P

0x5AC
Forget it... we've got to get out of here now!%K%P

0x5C0
I run through the grounds while clasping Kurumi's hand%Nwith all my might...%K%P

0x5CC
... We descend the stone staircase, going so fast that%Nit's like we're rolling down it...%K%P

0x5E0
Makoto「I don't think we should do this after all, Kurumi...」%K%P

0x5EC
Kurumi「W-What!? Whyyyy!?」%K%P

0x5F8
Makoto「Izumi-san... she sounded pretty serious. There really%Nmust be something at that shrine.」%K%P

0x604
Kurumi「Kurumi said it's fine!」%K%P

0x610
Kurumi「Geez, what's wrong? Maybe you're getting cold feet...%NThat's not like you at all, Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x61C
Makoto「No, it's not that I'm getting cold feet.」%K%P

0x628
Makoto「It has nothing to do with the story of the God of Demons%Neither.」%K%P

0x634
Makoto「It's just... how should I put this?」%K%P

0x640
Makoto「... There's probably something here. That's my reason for%Nwhy we can't go...」%K%P

0x64C
Kurumi「That's not an explanation.」%K%P

0x658
Makoto「That's fine, the reason doesn't matter. Anyway, let's try%Ngoing back for today...」%K%P

0x664
Kurumi「Whaaaaat...?」%K%P

0x6D0
I pull Kurumi's hand in the opposite direction, trying to go%Nback through the thicket we just came out of.%K%P

0x6DC
However...%K%P

0x6F0
Kurumi「Fine then! Kurumi will go by herself!」%K%P

0x704
... Kurumi violently shakes off my hand and turns around.%K%P

0x710
She runs up the stone stairs at top speed.%K%P

0x71C
Makoto「Hey! Wait, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x728
I follow after her, ascending the stairs...%K%P

0x734
When I finally reach the top, I catch up with Kurumi, and%Nfirmly grab her arm.%K%P

0x790
Kurumi「Hee hee hee... just as planned♪」%K%P

0x79C
Kurumi has a triumphant expression.%K%P

0x7A8
So when Kurumi said that she'd go by herself, that was a%Nbluff?%K%P

0x7B4
She predicted from the beginning that I'd follow her?%K%P

0x7C0
Geez... cut me a break.%K%P

0x7F0
... Shortly afterwards, the two of us are standing at the%Ntop of the staircase, staring at the infamous shrine.%K%P

0x7FC
Every part of the shrine, from the outer walls, pillars, and%Neven the large roof, have rotted away extensively,%Nprobably due to many years of being subjected to the%Nsea breeze.%K%P

0x808
I wouldn't be surprised if it collapsed this very second...%K%P

0x814
Nevertheless, despite its decrepit appearance, the%Nbuilding being bathed with moonlight still gives off the%Nimpression of being surrounded by an imposing air.%K%P

0x820
It's an intimidating atmosphere that feels like it could%Nscare off anyone who tried to trespass on this ground.%K%P

0x834
Kurumi「Hey, wanna try going in?」%K%P

0x840
Makoto「Didn't I tell you that we shouldn't?」%K%P

0x854
Kurumi「Fine then! Kurumi will go by herself!」%K%P

0x860
Kurumi desperately tries to violently shake off my hand,%Nbut I'm not falling for the same trick again.%K%P

0x86C
I firmly grab Kurumi by the arm and don't let go.%K%P

0x878
Makoto「Heh heh heh. Too bad...」%K%P

0x88C
Kurumi「O-Oww...」%K%P

0x898
Makoto「Huh?!」%K%P

0x8A4
Kurumi「... That hurts... Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x8B0
This is bad. Did I use too much strength...?%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「Ah, sorry...」%K%P

0x8C8
I instantly let go of her.%K%P

0x8DC
Kurumi「Heh heh♪ Just as planned yet again♪」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「Wha...」%K%P

0x8F4
I reach out for her again, but it's too late.%K%P

0x900
Kurumi is running towards the entrance of the shrine...%K%P

0x90C
Makoto「Damn you... Kurumi!」%K%P

0x918
And then, in the instant I yell this!%K%P

0x924
??「HEY!!!」%K%P

0x938
―A shout that could pierce the darkness breaks out%Nlike a roar!%K%P

0x944
??「Who the hell are you damn kids!!!?」%K%P

0x950
Startled, we look around us, but we can't find the owner%Nof the voice which has caused even the surrounding%Ntrees to shake.%K%P

0x95C
Forget it... we've got to get out of here now!%K%P

0x968
Kurumi has also turned around, and runs my way at full%Nspeed.%K%P

0x974
Her face is twisted in fear, looking like a kid who's prank%Nhas gone horribly wrong.%K%P

0x980
Kurumi rushes straight towards me...%K%P

0x98C
I take her hand, and we descend the stone staircase,%Ngoing so fast that it's like we're rolling down it...%K%P

0xA08
... Having made our getaway somehow, we walk towards%Nthe lodge from the coastline.%K%P

0xA1C
Kurumi「Kurumi told you, right? That it was an 'interesting place'...」%K%P

0xA28
Kurumi flashes me a satisfied grin filled with triumph, which%Nseems to shine and grow bigger by the second...%K%P

0xAAC
Yuka「Geez, where did you go!? Don't worry us!」%K%P

0xAB8
As soon as we go through the front door, Yuka begins%Nto scold us.%K%P

0xAC4
It's seems they got back from the hot springs quite%Nsome time ago.%K%P

0xAD0
Everyone's hair is already completely dry.%K%P

0xADC
Makoto「Sorry. We went for a little walk...」%K%P

0xAE8
I pretend to be contemplating my actions.%K%P

0xB04
Kurumi「You see, Onii-chan wanted to see the ocean at night no%Nmatter what, but didn't listen to Kurumi!」%K%P

0xB10
Makoto「... Huh???」%K%P

0xB1C
Kurumi「Even though Kurumi said 'Don't do this, you'll make%Neveryone worried sick' over and over again!」%K%P

0xB30
Yuka「Hold on Makoto, what's the meaning of this!?」%K%P

0xB3C
It seems she completely bought it...%K%P

0xB48
Having said that, there's no way I can say what we really%Ndid in front of Izumi-san...%K%P

0xB54
(Geez, Kurumi, you didn't have to make me look bad...)%K%P

0xB68
...%K%N

0xB74
... Before long, Kurumi and Izumi-san leave to return to%NLunabeach.%K%P

0xB80
At the end, Kurumi...%K%P

0xB94
Kurumi「Bye bye♪」%K%P

0xBA0
... Looks at me with a grin as she waves goodbye.%K%P

0xBB4
Makoto「Well then, time to go to bed...」%K%P

0xBC0
I walk towards my bedroom.%K%P

0xBCC
But three steps later, someone forcefully grabs me by%Nmy collar.%K%P

0xBE0
Yuka「Makoto-kun...? We have a lot to talk about...」%K%P

0xBEC
... For two hours afterwards, I become stuck with Yuka,%Nwho interrogates me under suspect of abducting a%Nminor...%K%P
