Though I came all this way to the summer house, my%Nuneasiness is preventing me from pressing the buzzer.%K%P

0x4C
With a deep breath, I press the button. Saki immediately%Nresponds over the intercom.%K%P

0x58
Makoto「Ah, it's me. It's Makoto.」%K%P

0x64
Saki「... Could you wait a minute?」%K%P

0x70
She turns off the intercom.%K%P

0x7C
(Oh, it seems she's in a good mood. She'll probably let me%Ninside.)%K%P

0x88
As I hold the basket, I examine the house.%K%P

0x94
I didn't notice it last night, but it's not half bad.%K%P

0xA0
I can't imagine how wealthy this "Asakura family" is, but%Njudging by this house, I get the feeling that they're%Npretty well off.%K%P

0xAC
The summer house is incredible. I feel like it could have%Nbeen designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, as rather than%Nbeing over-the-top lavish, it seems to be organic and in%Nsync with nature.%K%P

0xB8
Nature, huh... I suddenly remember the day I first met Saki.%K%P

0xC4
When she saw Tsukiya Hotel and the heated pool, she%Nscoffed and used words like "affectation" and "worldly."%K%P

0xD0
She said that no matter how hard humans try, there's no%Nway they can match up to natural beauty.%K%P

0xDC
She's very arrogant and rude, but I'm starting to think%Nthat her words were more sincere than condescending.%K%P

0xE8
If that's right, then when she sees this basket, Saki will%Nbe like...%K%P

0xF4
Saki「Wow, thank you. This is my favorite basket; I'm glad you%Nfixed it. Honestly, I was worried about what I was going to%Ndo with it, but you're quite the handy one.」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「No, it wasn't that big of a deal.」%K%P

0x10C
Saki「No, This kind of thing can't be replaced with money.」%K%P

0x118
Makoto「Is that so? Things like this should be treated with care.」%K%P

0x124
Saki「I know... And to think I said all of those things to you%Nyesterday... I'm very sorry.」%K%P

0x130
Makoto「It's all right. I understand...」%K%P

0x13C
... From there, everything will go exactly my way.%K%P

0x150
Saki「Whose way?」%K%P

0x15C
Makoto「Well, that's... huh?」%K%P

0x184
—GWAAAAA! When did she get here!?%K%P

0x190
Saki「So, what are you doing here?」%K%P

0x19C
I frantically show her the basket as I force a fake laugh.%K%P

0x1A8
Saki「What... about it?」%K%P

0x1B4
Makoto「'What about it'... umm, I thought for sure that this was%Nprobably your favorite, so I figured that, uhhh, it must%Nhave been priceless, so...」%K%P

0x1C0
Saki「And?」%K%P

0x1CC
Crap. This is completely going at Saki's pace!%K%P

0x1D8
Makoto「So... I decided I'd apologize about yesterday, and since I%Nthought this was important to you, I figured that, umm...」%K%P

0x1EC
Double crap. I no longer have any clue what the hell I'm%Nsaying...%K%P

0x1F8
Saki snorts as if she's scornfully mocking me and turns%Naround. She immediately begins to head back inside.%K%P

0x204
Makoto「Hey, wait, Saki!」%K%P

0x210
I chase after her.%K%P

0x260
I enter the summer house and follow Saki into the living%Nroom.%K%P

0x26C
She turns around, furious.%K%P

0x280
Saki「Who the hell said it was okay for you to come in?」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「Y-You just left without even fully hearing me out. It's not%Nlike I'm done talk-」%K%P

0x298
Saki「I thought I told you not to talk until I say so.」%K%P

0x2A4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2B0
This bitch. She's the same as always, isn't she? I was%Nnaive if I was expecting some sort of Kurumi-like%Nreaction from her.%K%P

0x2BC
I sulk in my defeat.%K%P

0x2C8
Saki glances at the basket.%K%P

0x2D4
Saki「You fixed it, huh... hmm...」%K%P

0x2E0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2EC
Saki「It's all right. I was going to throw it out anyway.」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Really?」%K%P

0x304
Saki「You can buy these anywhere, right? They're mass%Nproduced. It's not like they're unique.」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「Well, true, but still, sometimes these things can be...」%K%P

0x31C
Saki「'Sentimental', right?」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x334
Saki「It's written all over your face. You're quite an easy%Nperson to read.」%K%P

0x340
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x34C
Saki「You talk at a commoner's level.」%K%P

0x358
(Damn it... I'm trying to be modest here, and yet she's as%Nfull of herself as always!)%K%P

0x364
Makoto「Oh, really. Well then, I guess you're under no obligation to%Nuse this...」%K%P

0x370
I feel like a dumbass. I'm fed up of dealing with this shit. I%Ngo to leave, still holding the basket.%K%P

0x37C
It really was a mistake for me to even worry about her.%K%P

0x388
Saki「Wait.」%K%P

0x394
Makoto「What!?」%K%P

0x3A0
Saki「It's not like I said I wasn't going to use it anymore.」%K%P

0x3AC
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x3B8
Saki「Put it down.」%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「Take it yourself.」%K%P

0x3D0
Saki「Just put it down over there.」%K

0x17D0
"... All right."

0x17DC
"You should take it with your own hands."

0x410
Makoto「... All right.」%K%P

0x41C
I casually place the basket on a nearby desk.%K%P

0x428
I sneak a fleeting glance at Saki's face.%K%P

0x434
She seems to look almost relieved. Granted, the gesture%Nwas so slight, I could have mistaken it for something else.%K%P

0x440
Makoto「Looks pretty good, huh? There's no way it's as good as%Nbefore, but...」%K%P

0x44C
Saki「Well... it's not bad.」%K%P

0x458
Just as I thought. Saki is just being strangely stubborn%Nagain.%K%P

0x464
A "thank you" would have been nice... Oh, well.%K%P

0x470
I turn the basket around to show off the other side of it.%K%P

0x47C
Just then... The bell in the charm rings loudly.%K%P

0x4B4
—Suddenly, Saki's complexion changes.%K%P

0x4C8
Saki「Noooo...!」%K%P

0x4DC
Saki screams, runs over to the basket, grabs it, and with%Na haunted expression, begins searching for the source%Nof the sound.%K%P

0x4F8
Makoto「Telling me to put it down? Don't get conceited. Take it%Nyourself, Saki.」%K%P

0x504
When Saki comes over to me, she thrusts her hands out.%NI curtly give her the basket.%K%P

0x518
Saki clings to the basket as if she were holding a%Nnewborn baby. She tries to suppress a relieved grin, but%NI still catch it.%K%P

0x524
Makoto「Looks pretty good, huh? There's no way it's as good as%Nbefore, but...」%K%P

0x530
Saki「Well... it's not bad.」%K%P

0x53C
Cut me some slack... If she's happy, why can't she just%Nbe honest and say so?%K%P

0x548
Well, if it turned out she was extremely honest, like Kurumi,%Nthat'd be quite worrisome...%K%P

0x554
Saki examines the basket, rotating it.%K%P

0x560
Just then... The bell in the charm rings loudly.%K%P

0x5B0
—Suddenly, Saki's complexion changes.%K%P

0x5BC
Saki「Noooo...!」%K%P

0x5D0
Saki screams and instantly drops the basket. The color%Ndrains from her face as she frantically grabs it and%Nbegins to search for the source of the sound.%K%P

0x5DC
Before long, Saki finds the charm. She violently tears off%Nthe dangling bell! The basket slips out of her hands!%K%P

0x5E8
With her body visibly trembling, she runs over to the%Nwindow! She swings it open, and throws the bell away!%K%P

0x5F4
Haah... Saki takes a deep breath. When I approach her,%Nshe backs away from me.%K%P

0x608
Saki「Did that clone give it to you!?」%K%P

0x614
Makoto「What are you talking about?」%K%P

0x620
Saki「I'm talking about that clone!」%K%P

0x62C
Makoto「You mean Haruka?」%K%P

0x638
Saki「Her name doesn't matter!」%K%P

0x644
Makoto「What does Haruka have to do with it!?」%K%P

0x658
Saki「She's always... she's always chasing me!」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「Saki, calm down!」%K%P

0x670
Saki「Always, even though I keep taking it and taking it!」%K%P

0x67C
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0x688
Saki「Even though that thing's just a damn plaything!」%K%P

0x694
Makoto「What is 'that thing'?」%K%P

0x6A0
Saki「Stop...」%K%P

0x6AC
Makoto「What is it!?」%K%P

0x6C0
Saki「STOP!」%K%P

0x6CC
Saki「Stay away from me...」%K%P

0x6D8
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0x6E4
I unconsciously approach her. Saki draws back until her%Nback hits a wall.%K%P

0x6F0
Just when I close in on her... I hear a sound that sounds%Nlike a roar from the bottom of the earth.%K%P

0x74C
The floor violently shakes.%K%N

0x758
—It's an earthquake!%K%P

0x7A0
Saki「Kyaa!」%K%P

0x7AC
I firmly restrain the stumbling Saki as she lets out a%Nsharp scream.%K%P

0x7B8
We stay still like that without taking a step.%K%P

0x7C4
I wonder how long it's been...%K%P

0x804
... When I come to my senses, the earthquake has%Ncompletely subsided.%K%P

0x810
I quietly look at Saki. Our eyes meet.%K%P

0x81C
Now that my nerves have settled down, I try to search%Nfor the right words to say... However, Saki beats me to it.%K%P

0x830
Saki「... You can let go now.」%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「Huh? R-Right...」%K%P

0x850
When I do, Saki quickly moves away and turns her back%Non me.%K%P

0x85C
Saki「Go home.」%K%P

0x868
Makoto「Huh...? But we're not done tal-」%K%P

0x874
Saki「I have something to do after this.」%K%P

0x880
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x88C
Saki「Go home.」%K%P

0x898
The look in her eyes makes it clear that she isn't in the%Nmood to talk.%K%P

0x8A4
It can't be helped... I walk towards the exit.%K%P

0x8B0
On my way, I turn around just once.%K%P

0x8BC
Makoto「Um... will your business take long?」%K%P

0x8C8
Saki「It's fine, it doesn't matter.」%K%P

0x8D4
Makoto「... Everyone's will be meeting this evening at 5:00 at%NLunabeach. If you'd like, you're welcome to join.」%K%P

0x8E0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x8EC
She doesn't reply. All I can do is quietly leave. With that%Nthought, I leave Saki's summer house.%K%P

0x960
When I return to the lodge, I find Haruka outside the front.%K%P

0x974
Makoto「Yo!」%K%P

0x980
I greet her as casually as possible. It's as if I'm trying to%Nforget what had happened between me and Saki just a%Nshort while ago...%K%P

0x98C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x998
But Haruka doesn't answer.%K%P

0x9A4
Makoto「What? Is something wrong?」%K%P

0x9B0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x9BC
Haruka glances at me. For some reason, her eyes are%Nfilled with scorn...%K%P

0x9D0
Without saying a word, she briskly starts walking%Ntowards the forest road.%K%P

0x9DC
Makoto「... Haruka?」%K%P

0x9E8
Haruka「...」%K

0x17E8
"Wait a minute!"

0x17F4
Silently see off Haruka.

0xA28
Makoto「Wait a minute!」%K%P

0xA3C
Haruka「What?」%K%P

0xA48
Makoto「'What'... Are you going somewhere?」%K%P

0xA54
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「Where are you going?」%K%P

0xA6C
Haruka「Nowhere really.」%K%P

0xA78
Makoto「'Nowhere really'...?」%K%P

0xA84
Haruka「Well then, I'm going.」%K%P

0xA98
Makoto「Hey, wait...」%K%P

0xAA4
I try to run after Haruka when someone grabs me on the%Nshoulders from behind. When I turn around, I see that it's%NOkuhiko.%K%P

0xAB8
Okuhiko「Ishihara. Don't you understand you're bothering%NHaruka-chan?」%K%P

0xAC4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xAD0
Okuhiko「Damn, you really don't understand girls' feelings, do%Nyou...?」%K%P

0xAE4
While resisting the urge to punch Okuhiko, I shake him off%Nand head towards the forest road. I've lost sight of%NHaruka.%K%P

0xAF8
I silently see Haruka off.%K%P

0xB04
Before long, she disappears.%K%P

0xB10
Having lost my destination, and having nothing to do and%Nnowhere to go, I go up to the terrace.%K%P

0xB48
I can see the deep blue ocean from the terrace.%K%P

0xBAC
As I vacantly gaze out at the ocean, my thoughts drift%Nto Saki and Haruka.%K%P

0xBB8
When Saki heard the sound of the bell on the charm, she%Nreally freaked out.%K%P

0xBC4
On the other hand, as soon as I got back from Saki's%Nsummer house, Haruka became cold to me.%K%P

0xBD0
(Just what happened between those two?)%K%P

0xBDC
Tired of thinking, I look towards the forest path, and see%NSaki's retreating figure, walking at a quick pace.%K%P

0xBE8
(Now that I think about it, she did say she had something%Nto do...)%K%P

0xBF4
I'm curious.%K%P

0xC00
All right. Resolving myself, I decide to try to tail her...%K%P

0xC54
When Saki exits the forest road, she arrives at the%Ncoastline. She walks east for nearly five minutes, then%Ngoes down a side road.%K%P

0xCDC
The street has cherry blossom trees. It's the cherry%Nblossoms I passed when I was chasing Kurumi.%K%P

0xCF0
The street has cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0xCFC
(There were cherry blossoms in a place like this...?)%K%P

0xD08
But now isn't the time to be admiring them.%K%P

0xD14
I concentrate my gaze only on Saki's back, and resume%Nthe pursuit.%K%P

0xD8C
... Before long, I exit the tree-lined street, and arrive at%Nat Viewpoint Park.%K%P

0xD98
It offers an unbroken view of the grand blue sea that%Nlies before me.%K%P

0xDA4
Saki heads towards the lighthouse standing in the%Ncenter of the park.%K%P

0xDB0
Just then, another person appears from the shadow of%Nthe lighthouse.%K%P

0xDBC
I instinctively almost let out a gasp.%K%P

0xDC8
It's Haruka...%K%P

0xDD4
Saki and Haruka immediately begin to quarrel for some%Nreason.%K%P

0xDE0
It's the same as back then... just before the monstrous%Nwave struck that pier...%K%P

0xDEC
I feel my heart beating loudly.%K%P

0xDF8
I take a large roundabout path so they don't notice me,%Nand hide myself on the opposite side of the lighthouse.%K%P

0xE04
It's a place where I can hear their argument very well...%K%P

0xE20
Saki「Stop accusing me. I don't have it anymore.」%K%P

0xE2C
Haruka「You're lying. You took it away.」%K%P

0xE38
Saki「Do you intend to threaten me forever?」%K%P

0xE44
Haruka「Then just give it back to me.」%K%P

0xE50
Saki「I didn't want to see it again!」%K%P

0xE5C
Haruka「Please, stop lying!」%K%P

0xE68
Saki「I'm not lying!」%K%P

0xE74
Haruka「You're lying! You're lying! Give it back! Give me back that%N'bell'!」%K%P

0xE80
—Bell???%K%P

0xE8C
(Now that I think about it, when Saki heard that bell on the%Ncharm...)%K%P

0xE98
And, in that instant!%K%P

0xEAC
A scene flies by my mind...%K%P

0xEB8
That hopeless... dream I had... on the morning of the 1st...%K%P

0xEC4
(It couldn't be that the bell they're talking about... is THAT%Nbell!?)%K%P

0xED0
No, that's impossible...%K%N

0xEDC
That's impossible...%K%P

0xEF0
I shake my head countless times to get rid of that%Ndelusion.%K%P

0xEFC
(Anyway, right now, I've got to do something about this%Nsituation...)%K%P

0xF08
When I think that, I peek out from the shade of the%Nlighthouse, and observe those two.%K%P

0xF14
Their quarrel has now gotten to a physical level, for the%Ntwo are grappling.%K%P

0xF20
Saki manages to shake Haruka's hands off her, and%Nslowly draws back.%K%P

0xF2C
Haruka steadily closes the distance between her and%NSaki as she throws a furious glare at her.%K%P

0xF38
Saki slowly shakes her head.%K%P

0xF44
Haruka grabs Saki's hand again, but this time Saki%Nthrusts Haruka away with all her strength!%K%P

0xF50
Haruka falls flat on her back. She's not moving at all.%K%P

0xF5C
Saki shakes her head once again, trembling slightly, and%Nimmediately breaks off into a run.%K%P

0xF68
I come out from the shade and immediately rush over to%NHaruka's side.%K It seems she's lost consciousness.%K%P

0xF74
I lift Haruka up in my arms and shake her body.%K%P

0xF80
Makoto「Haruka! Haruka! Hang in there!」%K%P

0xF8C
The people who've noticed the uproar begin talking.%K%P

0xF98
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0xFA4
Suddenly, Haruka's eyes open and move around%Nrestlessly.%K%P

0xFB8
Haruka「Makoto...?」%K%P

0xFCC
I silently nod. Haruka raises half her body up, and blankly%Nstares into my eyes. Just then, Haruka's eyes suddenly%Noverflow with tears.%K%P

0xFD8
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xFE4
I hold out my hand to help her get to her feet, but she%Npushes it away.%K%P

0xFF0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x1004
Haruka「Don't worry about me.」%K%P

0x1010
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x101C
Haruka stands up and moves away as if to avoid me.%K%P

0x1028
Makoto「What are you saying?」%K%P

0x1034
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1040
Makoto「I saw what happened just now.」%K%P

0x104C
Haruka「It doesn't... concern you, Makoto.」%K%P

0x1058
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1064
Haruka「It doesn't concern you, so...」%K%P

0x1078
Haruka looks away from me and walks off. She quickens%Nher smooth pace, and starts getting farther and farther%Nfrom me.%K For some reason, all I can do is stare at her%Ndumbfoundedly.%K%P

0x1084
When I come to my senses, Haruka is already gone.%NFeeling somewhat senseless, I trudge down the road I%Ncame and head back.%K%P

0x10DC
I exit the tree-lined road and come out to the coastline.%K%P

0x10E8
Just then, I feel a stare from somewhere. When I shift my%Nattention towards the direction of Moon Beach, I see%NSaki firmly staring at me.%K%P

0x10F4
I am instinctively paralyzed by her intense gaze.%K%P

0x1108
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1114
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1128
Saki soon averts her gaze, and starts running in the%Ndirection of Moon Beach. I quickly chase after her.%K%P

0x117C
Saki doesn't slow down. Even though I'm running as fast%Nas I can, I can't catch up.%K%P

0x1188
Why? Why is she running away? It's all I can think about.%K%P

0x1194
I don't even understand why I'm chasing after Saki in the%Nfirst place.%K%P

0x11A0
Saki gets onto Moon Beach from the coastline and%Npasses right in front of Lunabeach. She makes a beeline%Ntowards Tsukiya Hotel.%K%P

0x11AC
Not once does she slow down.%K%P

0x11FC
When we reach the hotel, Saki rushes into the lobby from%Nthe front entrance.%K%P

0x1208
I desperately chase after her.%K%P

0x1214
Just then, a woman comes out from the lobby, and we%Ncrash into each other.%K%P

0x1220
The woman and I fall on top of each other.%K%P

0x122C
??「Kyaa!」%K%P

0x1238
Makoto「Sorry!」%K%P

0x1254
As I frantically get up and lend a helping hand to the%Nwoman, I breathe a sigh of relief.%K%P

0x1260
It's Izumi-san. Judging from her appearance, it seems%Nshe was delivering a pizza or something to the hotel.%K%P

0x129C
Izumi「Oh, if it isn't Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x12A8
Makoto「Are you all right, Izumi-san? If so, then I've got to go!」%K%P

0x12B4
But before I can, Izumi-san tightly grabs my hand.%K%P

0x12C0
Izumi「Wait a minute. I saw your expression earlier.」%K%P

0x12CC
Makoto「Huh? 'Expression'?」%K%P

0x12D8
Izumi「As a penalty, would you help me from now on?」%K%P

0x12E4
I don't really get it, but I've got to catch Saki right now!%K%P

0x12F0
Makoto「S-Sorry, Izumi-san! I'm in a hurry right now!」%K%P

0x12FC
Izumi「It's fine, isn't it? At any rate, it's been decided that we'll%Nall gather tonight at the shop, right?」%K%P

0x1308
Makoto「Yes, but...」%K%P

0x1314
Izumi「Makoto-kun!」%K%P

0x1320
Makoto「Yes, ma'am...」%K%P

0x132C
Izumi「Last night, Kurumi and I pulled an all nighter, and have%Ntreaded along all day exhausted.」%K%P

0x1338
Izumi「Do you know why? ... You should, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x1344
I-I see... That basket...%K%P

0x1350
I thought it was strange at first.%K%N

0x135C
I thought that even if Kurumi pulled an all-nighter, there's%Nno way she could have fixed it by herself in one night.%K%P

0x1368
Makoto「But I really have urgent busi—」%K%P

0x1374
Izumi「Whaaat? ... Makoto-kun, do you plan to abandon us%Nsisters?」%K%P

0x1388
Izumi-san's eyes get moist, and she suddenly%Ntransforms into a frail young woman...%K%P

0x1394
Wh... Why!? Why has it turned out this way?%K%P

0x13A0
It feels like I'm being mean to Izumi-san, doesn't it?%K%P

Izumi「Even though Kurumi and I are really in trouble... even%Nthough we need your help, Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x13B8
(Nooo... Izumi-san, please don't look at me with those%Neyes!)%K%P

Izumi「Makoto-kun only sees us as tools to be used...」%K%P

0x13D0
Izumi「When we run out of use, he plans to throw us out like%Nused-up, empty tubes of toothpaste...」%K%P

Makoto「N... No... Umm... Err...」%K%P

When I become flustered, Izumi-san continues to attack%Nme while I'm cornered.%K%P

0x13F4
Izumi「It's fine... I understand. Kurumi and I will just work our%Ndelicate and frail bodies to the bone.」%K%P

0x1400
Izumi「But when we collapse from overworking ourselves...%Ncould you at least nurse us back to health?」%K%P

0x1414
Izumi-san turns around, and starts frailly walking back%Ntowards Lunabeach.%K%P

0x1420
I should probably... just give up... on chasing Saki.%K%P

0x142C
Haah...%K%P

0x1438
Makoto「U-Umm... Izumi-san. I really am worried about you, so I'll help%Nyou...」%K%P

0x1444
Just then, Izumi-san quickly turns towards me while a%Nsmile rises to her face...%K%P

0x1458
Izumi「Huh? What about your urgent business?」%K%P

0x1464
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1470
Izumi「You're worried about Saki-chan, aren't you?」%K%P

0x147C
(How does she know that...?)%K%P

0x1488
Izumi「It's fine. Saki-chan will also definitely come! My intuition%Nsays so.」%K%P

0x1494
Izumi「Well then, let's go shopping!」%K%P

0x14A0
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x14AC
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you've heard about today's barbecue,%Nright?」%K%P

0x14B8
Makoto「Barbecue?」%K%P

0x14C4
Izumi「You haven't heard? Everyone's gathering today at%NLunabeach at 5:00.」%K%P

0x14D0
Makoto「Yeah... I heard about it, but...」%K%P

0x14DC
Makoto「... So we're all having a barbecue today?」%K%P

0x14E8
Izumi-san continues while giving me a deep nod.%K%P

0x14F4
Izumi「That's why we have a lot of preparations to make before%Nthen...」%K%P

0x1500
Izumi「But because the car isn't working now, I don't think I'm%Ncapable of carrying all the groceries I'm going shopping%Nfor all on my own.」%K%P

0x150C
Izumi「It would mean a lot if you could come with me, Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x1518
Makoto「O-Oh... I see...」%K%P

0x152C
In the end, I'm no match for Izumi-san...%K%P

0x1538
Thus, it's decided that I go running about, shopping for%Ningredients in order to prepare for the barbecue.%K%P
