"Then let's sneak in and check it out!"%K%N

0x3C
... To tell the truth, I was the one who said that, as an%Nicebreaker.%K%P

0x48
Nearly everyone agrees, but there's still one person%Nwho relentlessly protests.%K%P

0x90
Izumi「There, now you've seen it, right? Now let's hurry on back!」%K%P

0xA4
Izumi-san's hesitation is a little surprising.%K%P

0xB0
Then again, I'm also surprised that the others all agreed%Nto this.%K%P

0xBC
I only meant that proposal as a joke.%K%P

0xC8
Even so, to think we'd actually be doing this...%K%P

0xDC
Yuka「Somehow, this is a lot easier than I thought it'd be.」%K%P

0xE8
Yuka says this.%K%P

0xF4
Although she's whispering, I can tell she's excited.%K%P

0x100
Makoto「Well? What did I tell you?」%K%P

0x10C
I respond proudly.%K%P

0x118
This pool doesn't have a fence.%K%P

0x124
Instead, it's surrounded by hedges, so after we found a%Ngap, it was extremely easy for us to sneak in.%K%P

0x130
Fortunately, there's no one else here except for us...%K%P

0x144
Yuka「Ah! I know!」%K%P

0x150
Yuka's voice rises, as if she's just thought of something.%K%P

0x15C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x170
Yuka「I'll go get my swimsuit!♪」%K%P

0x17C
Makoto「W-What!?」%K%P

0x190
Yuka「After all, we broke in successfully, so it'd be a complete%Nwaste if we didn't go swimming.」%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1A8
Yuka「Well then, I'll go back to the lodge and get my swimsuit...%Ntell the others for me!」%K%P

0x1BC
Makoto「Hey! Yuka, wait!」%K%P

0x1C8
Yuka leaves the pool without hearing me...%K%P

0x1D4
("I'll go back to the lodge"...)%K%P

0x1E0
Easier said than done. I think a round trip will take nearly%Nan hour...%K%P

0x1EC
Does she think we're just going to stay here that long?%K%P

0x1F8
Man... that Yuka... She's so selfish sometimes...%K%P

0x20C
... As I'm thinking, Saki comes over.%K%P

0x218
Suddenly, she starts talking to me.%K%P

0x224
Saki「It seems that all Japanese hotels are the same.」%K%P

0x230
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x23C
Saki「The manager here clearly doesn't understand the%Nbeauty of Moon Beach...」%K%P

0x248
Saki's eyes are so passionate that they're scary.%K%P

0x254
Saki「No matter how hard humans try, they can't match up to%Nnatural beauty.」%K

0x10B8
"You're right."

0x10C4
"You think so?"

0x29C
Makoto「You're right.」%K%P

0x2A8
For the time being, I'll agree with her.%K%P

0x2BC
Saki「Aren't I...? These things are nothing more than worldly%Nrecreational facilities. Glad you get it.」%K%P

0x2C8
Satisfied, Saki leaves me with those words.%K%P

0x2DC
However, the truth is...%K%P

0x2F0
Makoto「You think so?」%K%P

0x304
Saki「Of course. These things are nothing more than crappy%Nrecreational facilities.」%K%P

0x310
Saki leaves me with those words.%K%P

0x324
I can't really sympathize with her.%K%P

0x330
All I can think of is how romantic this is, quite%Nuncharacteristic of me.%K%P

0x33C
By romantic, I mean the pool... The lights at the bottom of%Nit make the water look like it's glowing.%K%P

0x348
The scattering bundle of lights that shine to the sky%Nfrom the bottom of the pool make it closely resemble the%Ngates to Heaven.%K%P

0x354
The tips of light passing through the water are like a%Ndazzling, expanding country of light...%K%P

0x368
Okuhiko「Well, I guess this is nice...」%K%P

0x374
Okuhiko suddenly appears and says this, but he%Nspeaks in a somewhat affected tone.%K%P

0x380
Thanks to that, I am brought back to reality.%K%P

0x39C
Kurumi「Well? Now do you understand what Kurumi meant?」%K%P

0x3A8
This time, Kurumi speaks...%K%P

0x3B4
I respond to her question with a smile.%K%P

0x3C8
―Wait, where's Haruka...?%K%P

0x3D4
Glancing around, I quickly spot Haruka.%K%P

0x3E0
She's sitting alone by the poolside, dipping her feet in%Nthe water.%K%P

0x424
Every time she moves her slender legs, she creates tiny%Nripples that spread.%K%P

0x430
The flickering, wavering light reflects and shines on%NHaruka's entire body.%K%P

0x43C
I slowly walk towards her, as if I'm being drawn in.%K%P

0x450
I say nothing and silently sit down next to her.%K%P

0x45C
With the exception of the sound of splashing water, we%Nare wrapped up in stillness.%K%P

0x468
Kurumi「Geez, c'mon, try and catch Kurumi!」%K%P

0x474
Izumi「Hold on Kurumi, don't shout.」%K%P

0x480
On the opposite side of the pool, the two happy sisters%Nare playing together...%K%P

0x48C
As I think, the gentle evening breeze brushes against%Nmy skin...%K%P

0x498
It's filled with the scent of spring...%K%P

0x4A4
And Haruka... her nearly transparent figure, bathed by%Nthe pale light, is beautiful.%K

0x10D0
Ask her, "Does this feel good?"

0x10DC
Say nothing, just look at Haruka's face.

0x4EC
Makoto「Does this feel good?」%K%P

0x4F8
I ask this as I glance at her tiptoes, soaked in the water.%K%P

0x504
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0x510
With that one word, my heart tightens up.%K%P

0x51C
Up until now, there hasn't been a single ounce of warmth%Nin her voice.%K%P

0x528
This might be the first time I've felt something like this%Nfrom Haruka.%K%P

0x534
... I don't know why, but my heart is filled with emotion.%K%P

0x540
When I realize my mind is in a flutter, I turn my gaze%Nacross the water's surface.%K%P

0x554
I say nothing and just look at Haruka's face.%K%P

0x560
She doesn't seem to notice I'm sitting next to her, as she%Ncontinues to dip her tiptoes in the water.%K%P

0x56C
Splash, splash...%K%P

0x578
Gazing at her face from the side, I suddenly notice%Nthere's something different in the way she's carrying%Nherself.%K%P

0x584
How do I put it in words...%K%P

0x590
It's like she's broken free of her bonds... as if she's%Nattained enlightenment...%K%P

0x59C
Those sad eyes... her pupils are like an optical illusion%Nthat I feel like I'm being sucked into.%K%P

0x5A8
Haruka「... This feels good.」%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x5C0
I am caught off-guard by her sudden statement.%K%P

0x5CC
I don't quite know how to reply. ... Well, it's more than that.%K%P

0x5D8
With those words, my heart has tightened up.%K%P

0x5E4
Up until now, there hasn't been a single echo of warmth in%Nher words.%K%P

0x5F0
This might be the first time I've seen something like this%Nfrom Haruka.%K%P

0x5FC
... I don't know why, but my heart is filled with emotion.%K%P

0x608
When I realize my mind is in a flutter, I turn my gaze%Nacross the water's surface.%K%P

0x61C
The shimmering lights dance before my eyes, blurring%Nthem.%K%P

0x628
The swaying water makes me dizzy.%K%P

0x634
The country of light... feels like it could swallow me up at%Nany time...%K%P

0x66C
My field of vision slowly begins to grow hazy...%K%P

0x678
A drifting sense of fatigue wraps up my body.%K%P

0x684
My consciousness becomes faint.%K%P

0x690
(... Just where... am I...?)%K%P

0x724
Suddenly, I come to my senses.%K%P

0x730
On the opposite side of the pool, Izumi-san and Kurumi%Nare still playing with each other.%K%P

0x73C
Izumi「Hey! If you don't cut it out, I'll get mad!」%K%P

0x748
Kurumi「Heh heh, catch Kurumi if you can!」%K%P

0x754
Kurumi stands close by the pool's edge, egging%NIzumi-san on.%K%P

0x760
Izumi-san, trying to catch Kurumi, begins to carefully%Nclose the distance between them.%K%P

0x76C
Soon enough...%K%P

0x778
Izumi「There, I've got you now!」%K%P

0x784
... Izumi-san finally grabs Kurumi by her sleeve.%K%P

0x790
―Just then, at that exact moment!%K%P

0x7D0
The ground suddenly begins to shake.%K%P

0x7DC
The calm surface of the water is disturbed by ripples%Nthat begin to violently form.%K%P

0x7E8
The bundle of light shatters into pieces as it scatters%Nout in all directions.%K%P

0x7F4
By the time I notice it, it's already too late.%K%P

0x81C
A giant sheet of water shoots up as Izumi-san falls into%Nthe pool.%K%P

0x828
Only Kurumi remains on the poolside, looking like she%Nsacrificed Izumi-san to save herself (is this what you'd%Ncall "determination"?).%K%P

0x834
Izumi-san's face, sticking out of the pool's surface, has%Nan expression like that of a scared stiff little kid...%K%P

0x88C
Suddenly, I come to my senses.%K%P

0x898
On the opposite side of the pool, Izumi-san and Kurumi%Nare playing with each other.%K%P

0x8A4
(What!?)%K%P

0x8B0
Izumi「Hey! If you don't cut it out, I'll get mad!」%K%P

0x8BC
Kurumi「Heh heh, catch Kurumi if you can!」%K%P

0x8C8
Kurumi stands close by the pool's edge, egging%NIzumi-san on.%K%P

0x8F0
(It's happening again...)%K%P

0x8FC
I understand it now.%K%P

0x908
(This is the same thing that happened earlier...)%K%P

0x914
(It's the same thing that happened when Haruka fell down%Non Moon Beach...)%K%P

0x920
As I'm thinking all of this, Izumi-san begins to carefully%Nclose the distance between her and Kurumi.%K%P

0x92C
I quickly call out to her.%K%P

0x938
Makoto「Don't do it, Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x944
Izumi-san glances in my direction.%K%P

0x950
However, soon enough, she looks back at Kurumi, her%Nlegs still in motion.%K%P

0x95C
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x968
Makoto「Kurumi!」%K%P

0x974
I try raising my voice even more, but it doesn't seem like%Neither of them can hear me.%K%P

0x9C8
This isn't working out. I have to give them a more general%Nwarning. With that, I...%K

0x10E8
"Izumi-san, an earthquake's coming!!"

0x10F4
Run over to them.

0xA08
This isn't working out. I have to give them a more general%Nwarning. With that, I...%K%P

0xA14
Makoto「Izumi-san, an earthquake's coming!!」%K%P

0xA20
... try shouting.%K%P

0xA2C
Hearing my words, Kurumi turns towards me.%K%P

0xA38
But by taking that chance...%K%P

0xA44
Izumi「There, I've got you now!」%K%P

0xA50
... Izumi-san finally... grabs Kurumi by the sleeve.%K%P

0xABC
I already know what's going to happen...%K%P

0xAC8
The ground shakes, the pool ripples, and the lights fly%Naround in random directions.%K%P

0xAD4
By now, it's too late...%K%P

0xAFC
A giant sheet of water shoots up as Izumi-san falls into%Nthe pool.%K%P

0xB08
Her face emerges from the pool... with a frightened look%Non it. Absolutely nothing has changed from what I saw...%K%P

0xB48
... Soon enough, the ground calms down...%K%N

0xB7C
... The surface of the pool is once again still.%K%P

0xB88
Izumi-san has climbed out of the pool, and is completely%Nsoaked from head to toe.%K%P

0xB94
The completely dry Kurumi, and the utterly soaked%NIzumi-san...%K%P

0xBA0
The sisters stare at each other's faces...%K%P

0xBAC
... And suddenly, they begin to laugh.%K%P

0xBC8
Their happy laughter feels like a testament of their%Nrelationship.%K%P

0xBD4
Those two continue to laugh with no signs of stopping...%K%P

0xBE0
(Haah... Oh brother...)%K%P

0xBEC
I let out a sigh, and face the other side of the pool.%K%P

0xBF8
If they continue like this, their laughter may reach the%Nsun.%K%P

0xC04
Their two voices reverberate off the wall of the hotel,%Nresounding louder and louder.%K%P

0xC10
As a result, we soon hear a security guard shouting as%Nloud as thunder...%K%P

0xC3C
I run towards them.%K%P

0xC48
I know what's going to happen. This is probably... Anyway,%NI have to save them!%K%P

0xC54
Izumi-san slowly approaches Kurumi.%K%P

0xC60
... Will I make it?%K%P

0xC6C
Makoto「Izumi-san, wait!!」%K%P

0xC78
I shout.%K%P

0xC8C
Izumi「Kurumi, prepare yourself!」%K%P

0xCA0
But Izumi-san doesn't hear me.%K%P

0xCAC
Makoto「Kurumi, an earthquake's coming! Get away from the pool%Nright now!」%K%P

0xCB8
This time, I shout at Kurumi.%K%P

0xCCC
Kurumi「Huh? What did... you say?」%K%P

0xCE0
Kurumi's attention shifts from Izumi-san to me.%K%P

0xCEC
... But, at that moment!%K%P

0xCF8
Izumi「There, I've got you now!」%K%P

0xD04
... Izumi-san finally... grabs Kurumi by the sleeve.%K%P

0xD70
I already know what's going to happen...%K%P

0xD7C
The ground shakes, the pool ripples, and the lights fly%Naround in random directions.%K%P

By now, it's too late...%K%P

0xDB0
A giant sheet of water shoots up as Izumi-san falls into%Nthe pool.%K%P

0xE30
... The surface of the pool is once again calm.%K%P

0xE3C
(Hah... Oh brother...)%K%P

0xE48
I let out a sigh, and run over to where Izumi fell.%K%P

0xEA8
Izumi-san has climbed out of the pool, and is completely%Nsoaked from head to toe.%K%P

0xEB4
The dry Kurumi, and the soaked Izumi-san...%K%P
