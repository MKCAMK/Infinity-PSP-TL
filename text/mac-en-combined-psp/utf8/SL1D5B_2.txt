Night is approaching.%K%N

0x68
Saki and I are heading towards the lodge.%K%P

0x7C
Saki「Makoto-kun, you don't think I'm obscene, do you?」%K

0x1070
"Of course... not."

0x107C
"Uhh..."

0xC4
Makoto「Of course... not.」%K%P

0xD0
I writhe this answer out of my mouth.%K%P

0xDC
Saki「Really? ... You really think that?」%K%P

0xE8
Makoto「Y-Yeah... I do. I wouldn't lie to you, Saki...」%K%P

0xF4
I bet my face looks strained. I can't make eye contact%Nwith her either.%K%P

0x108
Saki「I'm happy...」%K%P

0x114
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x120
Those unexpected words surprise me.%K%P

0x12C
It's not like Saki to speak so honestly...%K%N

0x138
Those words that came directly out of her mouth... were%Nthe feelings that came straight from the bottom of her%Nheart.%K%P

0x144
Saki「I'm happy... even if you're lying... No, you're not lying,%Nright? You're a poor liar, after all.」%K%P

0x150
Even it's only a little bit, could it be that Saki is starting%Nto trust me?%K%P

0x15C
If that's the case... then I'm the happy one.%K%P

0x178
Makoto「Uhh...」%K%P

0x184
Saki「So you really do think that?」%K%P

0x190
Saki looks at me as her eyes get damp.%K%P

0x19C
(Hold on! It's illegal to get teary-eyed on me at times like%Nthis!)%K%P

0x1A8
... Although I think that, I'm unable to say anything.%K%P

0x1B4
Saki「I know myself. I'm egotistical and selfish... that's why I'm%Nnot cute. For once, I'd just like to empty my mind...」%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「It's fine, I don't think of any of that at all... It's fine if you%Njust stay the way you are right now.」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「It just seems like everyone's misunderstanding you,%Nthat's all...」%K%P

0x1D8
Saki「...」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「... Especially... Haruka...」%K%P

0x1F0
The instant I say that...%K%P

0x214
Saki「Stop talking about Haruka!」%K%P

0x220
... Saki suddenly expresses her discomfort.%K%P

0x22C
Makoto「Why... Why do you get so worked up when it comes to%NHaruka?」%K%P

0x238
Saki「It's fine, just stop it already! I don't want to hear about%Nthat clone...」%K%P

0x244
Makoto「... Then... just tell me one thing...」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「About that bell...」%K%P

0x25C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x268
Makoto「That bell... perhaps I might have some sort of connection%Nto it as well.」%K%P

0x27C
Saki「With you? That's impossible... because it's just a%Nplaything.」%K%P

0x288
Makoto「You said it was just a plaything yesterday as well... what%Ndo you mean by that?」%K%P

0x29C
Saki「...」%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「... You can't... tell even me?」%K%P

0x2B4
Saki「... Haruka threatened me.」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「Threatened you?」%K%P

0x2CC
Saki「Right. About that bell...」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「But yesterday, Haruka definitely said 'give it back'...」%K%P

0x2E4
Saki「That's because I took it from her once. But it was when I%Ngot swallowed up by that wave...」%K%P

0x2F0
I see... So that's how their quarrel at the pier started...%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「Then the bell's already sunk into the sea?」%K%P

0x308
Saki「But this morning, she showed it to me again.」%K%P

0x314
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x320
Makoto「Which means Haruka has the bell right now?」%K%P

0x32C
Saki nods.%K%P

0x338
Makoto「Saki... You're not the one who actually has it, right?」%K%P

0x34C
Saki「Wh-Why the hell would I?!」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「No, if you don't have it, then it's fine... So you really don't%Nhave it...」%K%P

0x364
Saki「Of course. I wouldn't lie to you.」%K%P

0x370
I trust Saki's words.%K%P

0x37C
I just promised it earlier...%K%P

0x388
"No matter what happens, I'll only trust Saki."%K%P

0x3F4
While we were talking, we pass by the front of Lunabeach.%K%P

0x400
When we do, Izumi-san and Kurumi come out, having just%Nclosed up shop.%K%P

0x40C
They tell us they're heading to the lodge again to cook%Ndinner.%K%P

0x418
The four of us decide to head to the lodge together.%K%P

0x468
After walking for a while, it gets dark around us.%K%P

0x474
The dark clouds conceal the surely starry and moon-lit%Nsky.%K%P

0x480
As we ascend the silent hill road, I ask Izumi-san a%Nquestion.%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「I'm happy you're coming, but isn't it too early to close the%Nshop?」%K%P

0x4A0
Izumi「Today, the daytime hours were packed with customers%Nnonstop, a rather rare occasion. We were so busy that%Nwe got exhausted. That's why we decided to close shop%Nahead of time.」%K%P

0x4B4
Kurumi「Today, Onee-chan got ten times as many customers%Nthan usual, so she's really pleased with her earnings.%NShe's so paranoid that she's even hauling them around.」%K%P

0x4C0
I see... so that's why the handbag Izumi-san's holding%Nright now is bulging so much.%K%P

0x4D4
Izumi「Be quiet. It's because you said you were going to stay%Nover tonight.」%K%P

0x4E0
Makoto「Staying over?」%K%P

0x4F4
Izumi「Oh, I'm sorry, Makoto-kun. I called Yuka-chan about this%Nearlier, but Kurumi said she wanted to go to the lodge to%Nstay over tonight, no matter what...」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「So you're staying over as well?」%K%P

0x50C
Izumi「I'm accompanying her as her chaperone. I'm going to%Nmake sure Kurumi doesn't cause any trouble...」%K%P

0x520
Kurumi「Kurumi would be all right even if she's alone! Onee-chan,%Nit's just because you want to go yourself.」%K%P

0x534
When Kurumi says that, Izumi-san lightly pokes her on the%Nhead.%K%P

0x548
Kurumi puffs her cheeks.%K%P

0x554
Seeing this scene of the two sisters acting so intimate%Ncauses me to break out into a smile.%K%P

0x568
But...%K%P

0x58C
Saki「But without Izumi-san and Kurumi-chan, there's no one to%Nservice the shop if someone else comes.」%K%P

0x598
... Saki suddenly says this.%K%P

0x5B4
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x5C8
Kurumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x600
Saki「If today was so busy, shouldn't you have kept the shop%Nopen for a while longer?」%K%P

0x614
Saki「After all, the shop usually doesn't get customers. So it%Nmight be bad for its future if you don't keep it open%Nduring times like this... Right, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x630
Izumi「W-Well, maybe. But I'm not that greedy, so...」%K%P

0x63C
Makoto「Hey, Saki! Watch your tone!」%K%P

0x658
Saki「I'm just speaking my mind. Is that bad?」%K%P

0x664
Makoto「Of course it's bad. Who do you think you're talking to?」%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Saki... who do you think fixed your basket?」%K%P

0x68C
Izumi「Makoto-kun, it's all right...」%K

0x1088
Tell the truth.

0x1094
I still have to keep it a secret!

0x6D4
Makoto「Don't you know... that Izumi-san and Kurumi pulled an%Nall-nighter just to fix that basket!? All for you...」%K%P

0x728
Saki「That... wasn't you?」%K%P

0x734
Makoto「Y-Yeah... that's right. I... didn't fix it.」%K%P

0x748
Saki「I'm... such an idiot...」%K%P

0x754
Makoto「...Huh?」%K%P

0x760
Saki「I'm such a goddamn idiot!!」%K%P

0x774
...Crap! At that point, I finally realize it.%K%P

0x780
I got carried away and said way too much...%K%P

0x7D4
Saki「What... does that mean...?」%K%P

0x7E0
Saki shoots a glare at me.%K%P

0x7EC
Makoto「... U-Uh... umm...」%K%P

0x7F8
Saki「You weren't the one who fixed it?」%K%P

0x804
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x810
Saki's intensity causes me to falter. I feel cold sweat%Nrunning down my temples.%K%P

0x824
Saki「Could it be...」%K%P

0x830
Saki looks at both Kurumi and Izumi-san.%K%P

0x84C
Kurumi「Ahaha...」%K%P

0x858
Izumi「U-Umm...」%K%P

0x874
Saki「I see... so that was it. I see now...」%K%P

0x880
Saki「If that's how it was, you should have told me.」%K%P

0x88C
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x898
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x8A4
Makoto「Umm... Saki-」%K%P

0x8B8
Saki「Don't speak until I say so!!」%K%P

0x8CC
Her thundering voice causes me to swallow my words.%K%P

0x8D8
Saki lowers her head as her shoulders shake.%K%P

0x8EC
Saki「This is all the same, isn't it... This is the same as back%Nthen...!!」%K%P

0x8F8
"Back then"...%K%P

0x904
It can't be... is she talking about the time... where she%Nmistook Okuhiko as the one who saved her life?%K%P

0x910
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x91C
Saki「I'm... such an idiot...」%K%P

0x928
Saki「I'm such a goddamn idiot!!」%K%P

0x93C
Saki shouts that and starts running.%K%P

0x948
I stand motionless in place, stunned.%K%P

0x954
There's no way in hell that I can chase after her.%K%P

0x960
I made the same mistake Okuhiko made.%K%P

0x96C
Though I didn't have any ill intentions, I still ended up%Ndeceiving her, just like he did.%K%P

0x978
"Humans are just liars."%K%N

0x984
Saki's words weigh heavily in my heart...%K%P

0xA0C
After dinner, I isolate myself in my room.%K%P

0xA18
Sitting together in a circle cheerfully after dinner... I'm not%Nin the mood for that sort of thing.%K%P

0xA24
As I throw myself down on the bed, my thoughts blankly%Nturn to Saki.%K%P

0xA4C
At that time, my door quietly opens.%K%P

0xA58
I sit up on my bed.%K%P

0xA64
Standing over there is Haruka.%K%P

0xA78
Haruka「Why are you the only one who went back to your room?」%K%P

0xA84
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA90
Haruka「Even though... they went to the trouble of coming here.」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「You mean Kurumi and Izumi-san?」%K%P

0xAA8
Haruka「Even though we have people over here, you went back%Nto your room. It's strange.」%K%P

0xAB4
Makoto「I know...」%K%P

0xAC0
Haruka「If you know, then why don't you join us?」%K%P

0xACC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAE0
Haruka「Goodbye then...」%K%P

0xAF4
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0xB00
I call out to Haruka to stop as she tries to leave the%Nroom.%K%P

0xB0C
That's right... I have to ask her about it...%K%P

0xB20
Haruka「What?」%K%P

0xB2C
Makoto「Haruka... you have it, don't you? That bell...」%K%P

0xB38
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xB44
Haruka「I don't have it... because she took it away from me.」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「No... you're lying.」%K%P

0xB5C
Haruka「I'm not lying.」%K%P

0xB68
Makoto「Saki doesn't have it.」%K%P

0xB74
Haruka「Did you confirm that?」%K%P

0xB80
Makoto「Saki said that you had it...」%K%P

0xB8C
Haruka「I don't have it.」%K%P

0xB98
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Would you... entrust me with that bell for%Njust one day?」%K%P

0xBA4
Makoto「I can't tell you the reason why...」%K%P

0xBB0
Makoto「It's just... that bell might be something very dangerous...」%K%P

0xBC4
The instant I say that, I notice a change in Haruka's%Nbehavior.%K%P

0xBD0
Haruka slowly reaches... her hand out... to the buttons on%Nher cardigan.%K%P

0xBDC
Remaining silent, she begins to unbutton them one by%None...%K%P

0xBE8
I am dumbfounded.%K%P

0xBF4
(Haruka... what are you...?)%K%P

0xC00
When she finishes unbuttoning, Haruka begins to reach%Nfor the hook of her skirt next.%K%P

0xC0C
And then, I finally come to my senses.%K%P

0xC18
I reflexively grab Haruka's hand, stopping it from moving.%K%P

0xC24
Makoto「Wh-What are you doing!?」%K%P

0xC38
Haruka「If I let you run a strip search on me, then that'll satisfy%Nyou, right?」%K%P

0xC44
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xC50
Haruka「If you don't trust me, then it can't be helped, right...?」%K%P

0xC5C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC68
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xC74
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC80
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xC8C
Makoto「I get it... I get it, Haruka...」%K%P

0xC98
Haruka firmly stares at me.%K%P

0xCA4
But I can't look at Haruka's eyes.%K%P

0xCB0
Haruka slowly begins to button up her cardigan.%K%P

0xCBC
I can't move an inch.%K%P

0xCD0
Once she straightens out her clothes, Haruka%Nwordlessly leaves the room.%K%P

0xCDC
I flop onto the bed.%K%P

0xCE8
(So not only have I deceived people, I've also lost the%Nability to trust them. Some great person I turned out to%Nbe, huh...?)%K%P

0xCF4
But...%K%N

0xD00
But Haruka and Saki... it's not clear which one of them is%Nlying...%K%P

0xD0C
I cringe as this intense conflict rages inside of my head.%K%P

0xD18
I want to escape from this agony right away.%K%P

0xD24
I shut my eyes, and try to turn off my mind.%K%P

0xD30
I'm so distressed that it's clear that I won't be able to%Nsleep well tonight...%K%P
