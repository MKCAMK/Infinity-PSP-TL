Izumi「All right, it's ready～!」%K%P

0x9C
As Izumi-san says this, she places down many different%Ndishes. I can see just by looking that they're all of%Nsuperb quality.%K%P

0xA8
There is a charming, rich aroma coming from the steaming%Npumpkin soup...%K%P

0xB4
The Italian salad is garnished with dressing, and the%Nplates of garlic and olive oil have an amazing smell...%K%P

0xC0
There are a wide variety of fish included with the paella,%Nmany adorned with the characteristic seashore scent%Nof bouillabaisse.%K%P

0xCC
My mouth quickly begins to water like crazy as I breathe%Nin those delicious scents.%K%P

0xD8
Makoto「Let's eat!」%K%P

0xE4
I instantly begin to stuff my face with the steaming%Npumpkin soup.%K%P

0x128
Makoto「Ooooooh...!」%K

0xD28
It feels like I'm going to faint.

0xD34
Faint.

0x170
Makoto「Ooooooh...!」%K%P

0x17C
It feels like I'm going to faint.%K%N

0x188
It's too damn good...%K%P

0x194
There's a world of difference between this and the food%NYuka made for lunch (if you could call that food).%K%P

0x1A0
The difference between the two is overwhelming.%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「Izumi-san, this is amazing!」%K%P

0x1B8
I eagerly shout this.%K%P

0x21C
I'm fainting. It's too damn good...%K%P

0x228
I pass out momentarily, and before long, I wake up to the%Nsight of the others hovering over me.%K%P

0x234
Izumi「A-Are you all right, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x248
Makoto「Oh, yeah, I'm all right. It's just that your food was tastier%Nbeyond my imagination...」%K%P

0x25C
Yuka「Aren't you overreacting? It seems kinda contrived...」%K%P

0x268
Yuka looks stunned.%K%P

0x274
Well, after making me eat that crap you call food, this is%Nlike a feast cooked by the gods!%K%P

0x280
I didn't say that, but I sure as hell thought of it.%K%P

0x29C
Izumi「Oh, so that's all. I thought for certain that because I%Nused a few expired vegetables, you had gotten food%Npoisoning.」%K%P

0x2A8
...!!%K%P

0x2B4
Those words make us all shudder.%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「I... Izumi-san... Is that true?」%K%P

0x2CC
Okuhiko's face twitches with a frightened expression.%K%P

0x2E0
Izumi「N... No! I'm just kidding! Geez, it's no good if you all take me%Nseriously.」%K%P

0x2EC
Izumi-san frantically waves her hands, desperately%Ntrying to explain herself.%K%P

0x308
Yuka「Come on, don't scare me like that, Izumi-san! I even had%Nseconds!」%K%P

0x314
Well, with your iron stomach, you have nothing to fear.%K%P

0x330
Kurumi「Onee-chan, you've got a sick mind!」%K%P

0x33C
Kurumi pouts in protest.%K%P

0x350
Izumi「Geez, I know that was wrong... I'm sorry, everyone.」%K%P

0x35C
Makoto「It's fine. But this cooking is seriously the best I've ever%Nhad!」%K%P

0x368
I try to back her up.%K%P

0x38C
Izumi「I'm so glad that you like it.」%K%P

0x398
Izumi-san happily watches us eat.%K%P

0x3B4
Yuka「With this, even you can't complain, right, Saki?」%K%P

0x3C0
Yuka then speaks to Saki.%K%P

0x3DC
Saki「Hmm, well... it's not bad.」%K%P

0x3E8
As she says this, she eats seconds after seconds%Nenthusiastically.%K%N

0x3F4
Since her pizza never arrived, she might not have eaten%Nany lunch.%K%P

0x400
As Saki is eating heartily, Izumi-san is indeed satisfied.%K%P

0x41C
Diagonally from me, Haruka and Kurumi are sitting next to%Neach other.%K%P

0x428
Kurumi「Hey? Isn't Onee-chan's cooking the best?」%K%P

0x434
The smiling Kurumi asks Haruka this.%K%P

0x440
Just then...%K%P

0x45C
... Haruka suddenly stops moving,

0x484
and then quietly places the spoon in her right hand on%Ntop of the plate.%K%P

0x490
All of us fall silent...%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「What's wrong, Haruka?」%K%P

0x4A8
I ask her this, but Haruka's lips remain firmly shut and%Ndon't move.%K%P

0x4B4
Kurumi observes Haruka's expression with wonder.%K%P

0x4F0
Haruka「... I'm sorry.」%K%P

0x4FC
She says this in a quiet voice that's like a whisper.%K%P

0x528
Okuhiko「Are you not feeling well?」%K%P

0x534
Okuhiko asks this in concern.%K%P

0x540
Haruka「... Y-Yes.」%K%P

0x54C
Her face certainly looks pretty pale.%K%P

0x558
Now that I think about it, when we got here, it felt like%NHaruka was acting a little weird.%K%P

0x56C
Haruka「... I'm really... sorry about this.」%K%P

0x580
Haruka leaves her seat as she says this.%K%P

0x58C
Izumi「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x598
Worried, Izumi-san nestles over next to Haruka.%K%P

0x5A4
Haruka leans on Izumi-san's arm as she is led far away%Nfrom the table... and quietly sits down in the seat at the%Nfarthest corner of the counter.%K%P

0x5B8
Kurumi「Did... Kurumi say something wrong...?」%K%P

0x5C4
Kurumi looks puzzled, as if she doesn't know what to do.%K%P

0x5D0
Her bright, large eyes are still filled with innocence.%K%P

0x608
Yuka「Ha ha! That's not it. It's all right, Kurumi-chan, it's not your%Nfault!」%K%P

0x61C
Yuka's gentle voice dispels the gloomy atmosphere for%Nthe time being.%K%P

0x678
We returned to sitting around the huge table, fully%Nenjoying our wonderful dinner.%K%P

0x684
Haruka has also calmed down, and is now sitting in her%Noriginal seat.%K%P

0x6C8
Izumi-san clears everything away when we've finished,%Nand serves us some after-dinner black tea.%K

0xD40
"Is it all right to accept this?"

0xD4C
I have nothing in particular to say.

0x710
Izumi-san clears everything away when we've finished,%Nand serves us some after-dinner black tea.%K%P

0x72C
Makoto「Is it all right for us to accept this?」%K%P

0x738
I speak up.%K%P

0x74C
Izumi「I told you, it's fine! It's the least I could do to make up for%Nearlier.」%K%P

0x758
Izumi-san's probably talking about the pizza incident.%K%P

0x764
But while I can understand her repaying Saki, I don't think%Nwe deserve such hospitality...%K%P

0x780
Izumi「Is this enough tea?」%K%P

0x78C
Izumi-san makes sure we all have teacups.%K%P

0x798
Just then...%K%P

0x7B4
Okuhiko「I'm really sorry about all the trouble.」%K%P

0x7C0
... Okuhiko says this.%K%P

0x7CC
It doesn't seem like there's much shyness in the way he%Nsaid that...%K%P

0x7D8
Okuhiko「By the way, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x7E4
Izumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0x7F0
Okuhiko「You said this earlier, didn't you? 'When it's night time, the%Nshop is both a restaurant and a bar.'...」%K%P

0x7FC
Izumi「I did, what of it?」%K%P

0x808
Okuhiko「Then could it be that you closed the shop earlier today%Nfor us?」%K%P

0x81C
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x828
Now that he mentions it, he's right.%K%P

0x834
In the time it took us to eat, there hasn't been a single%Ncustomer...%K%P

0x840
Makoto「Then does that mean you reserved the place just for%Nus?」%K%P

0x864
Kurumi「Kyahahahaha! Wrong, wrong!」%K%P

0x870
Kurumi suddenly bursts out into laughter, holding her%Nsides.%K%P

0x87C
Kurumi「We've been completely open this whole time! This is%Nnormal for the shop!」%K%P

0x888
Kurumi「In other words, we're open, but not getting any business.」%K%P

0x89C
Izumi「Well... it is night.」%K%P

0x8B0
Kurumi「True... but we don't get many customers even during the%Nday, you know?」%K%P

0x8BC
Izumi「Well... it's off season.」%K%P

0x8C8
Izumi-san doesn't look happy to admit it.%K%P

0x8E4
Saki「But it's strange that this place doesn't get much%Nbusiness in spite of the great food...」%K%P

0x8F8
Kurumi「That's because almost everyone goes to... Tsukiya.」%K%P

0x904
Saki「'Tsukiya'?」%K%P

0x910
Kurumi「You can see it from here. It's that huge building!」%K%P

0x91C
Looking in the direction Kurumi's pointing, we can see a%Nbrightly lit white wall structure in the darkness.%K%P

0x928
Kurumi「That's Tsukiya Hotel. It's this shop's main competition.」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x940
Kurumi「It may look extravagant, but it's actually an%Neconomically priced hotel.」%K%P

0x94C
Kurumi「On the top floor is a viewpoint restaurant, which is not%Nonly cheaper than here, but the view is simply amazing...」%K%P

0x958
Saki「But it has no dignity.」%K%P

0x964
Saki boldly states this.%K%P

0x970
Saki「The scenery here is just as good. That place is nothing%Nbut gaudy...」%K%P

0x97C
Saki「All they have is what's called 'affectation'.」%K%P

0x998
Izumi「Right? That's very very very very true!」%K%P

0x9AC
Izumi「Impressive, Saki-chan. You have a good eye!」%K%P

0x9B8
Izumi-san showers Saki with praise.%K%P

0x9CC
Saki「... No, it's not like I'm defending this shop of anything.」%K%P

0x9D8
However, it's obvious she's lying.%K%P

0x9E4
She dislikes being agreed with, so she's denying it...%K%P

0x9F0
She's definitely just the kind of person who says the%Nopposite of what she means.%K%P

0xA04
Izumi-san smiles cheerfully as her hands fiddle with a%Nteaspoon.%K%P

0xA10
She seems to understand the true meaning behind%NSaki's words.%K%P

0xA2C
Kurumi「Besides, they've got a heated pool there as well!」%K%P

0xA38
Kurumi's seems to be the only serious one here.%K%P

0xA44
Immediately after hearing that random statement, we all%Nspontaneously laugh out loud...%K%P
