After we finish the delicious dinner Izumi-san cooked for%Nus... everyone goes to Moon Beach.%K%P

0x80
Kurumi also tries to follow the others and go outside, but%NI decide to grab her by the arm and pull her back.%K%P

0x94
Kurumi「Huh? What?」%K%P

0xA0
Kurumi turns around, questioning me.%K%P

0xAC
Makoto「No, I just wanted to talk...」%K%P

0xB8
Of course, I have nothing to talk about.%K%P

0xC4
I just absolutely can't let Kurumi go to Moon Beach.%K%P

0xD0
Soon, Izumi-san will probably start telling the others the%Nstory of the "Shiki no Mori Shrine."%K%P

0xDC
If possible, I want these seven days to end without%NKurumi learning about the shrine.%K%P

0xE8
What's Kurumi's connection to the shrine? ―I still%Ndon't know...%K%P

0xF4
Kurumi「Talk?」%K%P

0x100
Makoto「Umm... how do I put this... err...」%K%P

0x114
Kurumi「... Oh, got it! You're trying to talk about your prediction%Nearlier, right?」%K%P

0x120
Makoto「Ah, um... well... didn't I tell you so?」%K%P

0x12C
Kurumi「But Kurumi already figured out the trick.」%K%P

0x138
Makoto「What trick?」%K%P

0x144
Kurumi「You planned it with Yuka-san from the start, right?」%K%P

0x150
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x164
Kurumi「Geez, it's useless to play dumb, you know? It has to be%Nthat! Kurumi can't think of any other way than that!」%K%P

0x170
Makoto「... I guess you got me?」%K%P

0x17C
Kurumi「Kurumi knew it♪ That's what she thought♪」%K%P

0x190
Kurumi「Then Kurumi will head to Moon Be-」%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「Hold it!」%K%P

0x1A8
Just as Kurumi tries to go outside, I grab her arm again.%K%P

0x1B4
Izumi-san's story has probably only just begun.%K%P

0x1C0
Makoto「Hey... Kurumi, do you love scary stories?」%K%P

0x1D4
Kurumi「Yep♪ She loves them♪」%K%P

0x1E0
Makoto「Then I shall tell you a scary story!」%K%P

0x1EC
Kurumi「Sure♪ Maybe next time?」%K%P

0x1F8
Kurumi says this, and turns around.%K%P

0x204
I hold her back by the arm yet again.%K%P

0x210
Makoto「I'm telling you to wait!」%K%P

0x224
Kurumi「Geez, what is it!?」%K%P

0x230
Makoto「I can't tell you next time. If I don't tell you this time, I'll... I'll%Nforget it...」%K%P

0x244
Kurumi「Hmm... then Kurumi'll listen just for a little bit.」%K%P

0x250
Makoto「All right. Then I'll begin.」%K%P

0x264
Kurumi「Okay.」%K%P

0x270
Makoto「I heard this from my friend...」%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「There's this mountain trail on a pass... with this loooong%Ntunnel-」%K%P

0x290
Kurumi「Oh, Kurumi's heard that one already...」%K%P

0x29C
With that, Kurumi turns around.%K%P

0x2A8
I reach out to hold her back...%K%N

0x2B4
... but I miss.%K%P

0x2C0
Kurumi evades my grasp, and rushes out the door...%K%P

0x2CC
(C-Crap...!)%K%P

0x334
I run after her, but by the time I get there...%K%P

0x364
Kurumi「Hey, what were you talking about?」%K%P

0x378
Saki「There's a shrine nearby.」%K%P

0x394
Okuhiko「Izumi-san was in the middle of telling us a rumor about%Nthat shrine.」%K%P

0x3A0
Kurumi「Hmm...」%K%P

0x3AC
Okuhiko「Kurumi-chan, you've never heard of that shrine before?」%K%P

0x3B8
Kurumi「Nope. First time Kurumi's ever heard of it!」%K%P

0x3C4
Okuhiko「Well then, isn't that exciting?」%K%P

0x3D0
It isn't exciting at all...%K%P

0x3EC
Saki「Well then, Izumi-san, will you continue?」%K%P

0x408
Izumi「Y-Yes...」%K%P

0x414
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x420
Saki「Izumi... san?」%K%P

0x42C
Izumi「Umm...」%K%P

0x438
Izumi「Where was I?」%K%P

0x444
Saki「You were up to the part where you initially thought it was%Nnothing more than a myth.」%K%P

0x450
Izumi「I see... Yes, that's right. When I first heard that story, I%Nwas also doubtful. But then...」%K%P

0x4D4
Haah...%K%N

0x4E0
But there's nothing more that can be done here,%Nanyway...%K%N

0x4EC
Just because Kurumi's heard the story of the shrine%Nnow doesn't necessarily mean that history will repeat%Nitself..%K%N

0x4F8
This is only the trigger for that incident...%K%N

0x504
No, it might not actually be the trigger in the first place.%K%P

0x518
What really caused it was Kurumi overhearing my%Nconversation with Izumi-san.%K%N

0x524
If it hadn't happened, then that incident would never%Nhave happened.%K%N

0x530
That means that if I can prevent that conversation, then%NI can avert that tragedy.%K%N

0x53C
I can't do anything about events that have already%Noccurred, after all.%K%P

0x548
―Anyway, I've got to think positively!%W%W%N%N

0x554
I immediately pull myself together.%K%P

0x5B4
Izumi「No way! Absolutely not!」%K%P

0x5C0
Izumi-san's shout abruptly brings me back to reality.%K%P

0x5D4
Kurumi「Huh, why not?」%K%P

0x5E0
Izumi「'Why not'!?」%K%P

0x5EC
Izumi「Weren't you listening, Kurumi? That story I told you just%Nnow wasn't a joke. Do you understand that?」%K%P

0x5F8
Kurumi「Kurumi understands... But... if we only look at it from a%Ndistance, then...」%K%P

0x604
Izumi「See, you don't understand. You don't understand at all!」%K%P

0x610
Kurumi「But...」%K%P

0x61C
Izumi「No buts! No means no!」%K%P

0x628
Izumi「All right? Do you understand?」%K%P

0x63C
Kurumi「Boo...」%K%P

0x6B0
Yuka「Well then, goodnight, Izumi-san, Kurumi-chan.」%K%P

0x6CC
Izumi「Goodnight. Please be careful on your way back, okay?」%K%P

0x6D8
Kurumi「Bye bye♪」%K%P

0x6E4
Once everyone finishes saying their goodbyes, the two%Nsisters disappear into the shop.%K%P

0x6F8
Or so I think...%K%P

0x704
Kurumi「Oh!! Almost forgot!」%K%P

0x734
Kurumi comes out again, throwing open the door with all%Nher might...%K%P

0x740
(Huh? This is strange...)%K%P

0x74C
Didn't Kurumi come back out last time because she had%Nforgotten to deliver Saki's message?%K%P

0x758
But this time, nothing happened to Saki...%K%P

0x764
Kurumi「You know what? Kurumi remembered there's something%Nshe had to tell you!」%K%P

0x770
Everyone「???」%K%P

0x77C
Kurumi「From now on, Kurumi has decided to call Okuhiko-kun%N'Okkun'♪」%K%P

0x788
Okuhiko「... Huh?」%K%P

0x794
Kurumi「And she's decided to call Makoto-kun 'Onii-chan'♪」%K%P

0x7A0
Okuhiko「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x7AC
Yuka「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x7B8
Haruka「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x7C4
Kurumi「Is that all right, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x7D0
Makoto「Yeah, it's all right.」%K%P

0x7DC
I answer positively.%K%P

0x7E8
"Onii-chan"...%K%N

0x7F4
I've missed being called that.%K%N

0x800
Those words soothe my heart...%K%P

0x814
Kurumi「Eheh♪ That's good♪」%K%P

0x820
Kurumi「Well then, goodnight everyone♪」%K%P

0x82C
Kurumi goes back into Lunabeach while waving her hand%Nwidely.%K%P

0x838
So she came out here just to tell us that...%K%P

0x844
I instinctively break out into a grin.%K%P

0x8AC
When we return to the lodge, I take a bath, brush my%Nteeth, change into my nightclothes, and lie down on the%Nbed.%K%P

0x8B8
Makoto「Aaah...」%K%P

0x8C4
As I yawn...%K%P

0x8EC
... I hear a knock on the door.%K%P

0x8F8
Makoto「Yes, come in.」%K%P

0x934
Haruka「Um...」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「Haruka? What's wrong?」%K%P

0x94C
Haruka「Makoto... can you fish?」%K%P

0x968
Makoto「Fish?」%K%P

0x974
Ah, now that I think about it, tomorrow is the day Haruka%Nand I went fishing...%K%P

0x980
Makoto「Yeah! I'm great at fishing!」%K%P

0x98C
I answer cheerfully.%K%P

0x998
Haruka「Then... will you teach me tomorrow?」%K%P

0x9A4
Makoto「Of course!」%K%P

0x9B0
Haruka「Really?」%K%P

0x9BC
Makoto「Really!」%K%P

0x9C8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x9D4
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x9E8
Haruka「Thank you.」%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「No, no... I haven't even taught you yet...」%K%P

0xA00
Makoto「Isn't it too early to be thanking me?」%K%P

0xA0C
Haruka「Yes... but... thank you.」%K%P

0xA18
Makoto「... Well then, tomorrow?」%K%P

0xA24
Haruka「Yes.」%K%P

0xA38
Haruka leaves the room.%K%P

0xA44
I look back on my previous thoughts...%K%P

0xA50
"The next seven days will be happy ones."%K%P

0xA5C
"I will guide them to happiness..."%K%P

0xA68
... That's my other important duty.%K%P

0xA74
I didn't even hesitate to accept Haruka's offer to go%Nfishing...%K%P
