I pursue Izumi-san in the intense rain.%K%P

0xC8
For some reason, I feel strangely uneasy.%K%P

0xD4
(I have to hurry!) ―I urge myself onwards.%K%P

0x118
I arrive out on the coastline road, and look around.%K%P

0x124
―Found her!%K%P

0x130
I see Izumi-san's small, retreating figure.%K%N

0x13C
She's running to the west.%K%P

0x148
I run after her with all my strength, kicking off the wet%Nasphalt...%K%P

0x19C
Even when I enter the forest path, Izumi-san's speed still%Nhasn't dropped a bit.%K%P

0x1A8
I run up the hill road as fast as I can.%K%P

0x1B4
Izumi-san hasn't looked back once.%K%P

0x1C0
Despite that, she desperately runs, as if she knows I'm%Nchasing her.%K%P

0x1CC
I'm unable to close the distance between us.%K%P

0x210
Izumi-san finally stops just as she arrives in the vicinity%Nof the lodge.%K%P

0x224
Izumi「Stay away!」%K%P

0x230
When she notices me, Izumi-san shouts.%K%P

0x254
And once again, she goes running off...%K%P

0x260
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x298
Izumi-san pushes through the deep thicket while%Nretreating deep into the forest.%K%P

0x2A4
But as a natural result, her speed drops.%K%P

0x2B0
I use this opportunity to quickly catch up to her and%Ngrab her arm.%K%P

0x2BC
Makoto「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x2C8
I tug her arm, forcing her to turn around.%K%P

0x2EC
Izumi「... Why did you chase after me?」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x304
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x31C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x328
Makoto「I'm sorry... I went way too far earlier.」%K%P

0x334
When I mutter these words, Izumi-san shakes her head.%K%P

0x340
Izumi「Makoto-kun, it was reasonable for you to blame me.」%K%P

0x34C
Izumi「It's only natural that you said those things.」%K%P

0x358
Izumi「I don't care how badly you think about me.」%K%P

0x364
Izumi「... But... I want you...」%K%P

0x370
Izumi「I want you to believe this, if nothing else...」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x388
Izumi「The one thing I couldn't lie about... were my feelings...」%K%P

0x39C
Izumi「I love you, Makoto-kun, so if nothing else, I want you%Nbelieve my feelings!」%K%P

0x3C4
I stare into Izumi-san's eyes.%K%P

0x3D0
Izumi-san is also looking straight into my eyes.%K%P

0x3DC
I can't feel anything that makes it seem like she's lying in%Nthat serious gaze of hers.%K%P

0x3F4
Makoto「... Then why...?」%K%P

0x400
Makoto「Why did you team up to do all these ridiculous things?」%K%P

0x414
Izumi「That's because of...」%K%P

0x428
Izumi「That's because of...」%K%P

0x454
Izumi「... Cur▲...」%K%P

0x460
Then, just as Izumi-san says this...%K%P

0x46C
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x478
Yuka「Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x484
... I can hear Okuhiko and the others' voices from behind.%K%P

0x498
I turn around.%K%P

0x4A4
In that instant, my attention slips from Izumi-san to the%Nothers.%K%P

0x4B0
At that time, Izumi-san shakes off my grip.%K%P

0x4C4
Izumi「I'm so sorry...」%K%P

0x4D8
Izumi-san takes off again.%K%P

0x4E4
Makoto「WAIT!!」%K%P

0x4F0
I pursue her.%K%P

0x4FC
Izumi-san steadily advances through the forest.%K%P

0x508
She pushes her way through the plants while heading%Ntowards a treetop that's sticking out...%K%P

0x514
―But in the blink of an eye!%K%P

0x520
Izumi「!!!」%K%P

0x52C
Izumi-san...%K%N

0x538
... disappears.%K%P

0x544
It's so sudden... as if she was spirited away...%K%P

0x550
Makoto「I... Izumi-san!?」%K%P

0x55C
I rush over there and then...%K%N

0x568
I see...%K%P

0x5C0
―Izumi-san!!!%K%P

0x5E8
I instantly stretch out my hand.%K%P

0x5F4
Izumi-san has fallen off a steep cliff at the farthest end%Nof the forest...%K%P

0x600
She barely managed to grab a protruding tree root with%Nher left hand.%K%P

0x60C
With all my strength, I reach my arm out, and touch her%Nhand.%K%P

0x620
I bend myself forward far as I can in order to grab her%Nwrist.%K%P

0x62C
I look down, and see the black, wet ground...%K%P

0x638
My eyes get disoriented from the staggering height.%K%P

0x644
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x650
Her eyes are filled with fear.%K%P

0x65C
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x668
I don't answer.%K%P

0x674
I have no time to answer.%K%P

0x680
I'm lying on my stomach so I can reach her, but all of the%Nsudden, my body begins to slip forward.%K%P

0x68C
I've nothing supporting me, since I've put all my strength%Ninto pulling her up.%K%P

0x698
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0x6A4
Izumi「Let go...」%K%P

0x6B0
(―!?)%K%P

0x6BC
Izumi「At this rate...」%K%P

0x6C8
Izumi「Even you will...」%K%P

0x6D4
(―What are you saying!?)%K%P

0x6E0
(―Why are you saying something so ridiculous?!!)%K%P

0x6EC
I'm gripping her thin wrist as tightly as possible.%K%P

0x6F8
I grind my molars so hard that it feels like they could%Nbreak.%K%P

0x704
I'm reaching my limit.%K%P

0x710
I feel Izumi-san's arm begin to rapidly lose strength.%K%P

0x72C
―And, right after that!%K%P

0x740
Whoosh! She pulls my arm with ferocious strength,%Npropelling me forward.%K%P

0x74C
I feel like I'm gently floating...%K%P

0x758
I don't know what just happened...%K%N

0x764
... I just see the black sky...%K%P

0x770
...%K%N

0x77C
...%K%N

0x788
...%K%P

0x7B8
Slam!%K%P

0x820
Izumi-san's cold body is stretched out in the soaking%Nwet mud...%K%P

0x82C
(... Ah... Aah...)%K%P

0x838
(... I need to hurry...)%K%P

0x844
(... and save Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x850
I try to stand up, but for some reason, my body can't%Nmove.%K%P

0x85C
I can't put any strength into it.%K%P

0x868
Suddenly, I feel intense nausea...%K%P

0x874
With a loud gurgle, I throw everything up.%K%P

0x880
(... It's blood...)%K%P

0x88C
My bright red blood begins to dissolve into the water...%K%P

0x898
(... Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x8A4
(... What...)%K%P

0x8B0
(... What... should I do...?)%K%P

0x8BC
Even though my body feels like it's been smashed into%Npieces, I force power into it.%K%P

0x8C8
I do my best to painfully crawl across the mud until I'm%Nbeside Izumi-san.%K%P

0x8D4
Izumi「... Makoto... kun...」%K%P

0x8E0
I hear a small, faint voice come from her mouth.%K%P

0x8EC
Izumi「I wanted...」%K%P

0x8F8
Izumi「... to see...」%K%P

0x904
Izumi「the stars with you...」%K%P

0x910
Izumi「... just one more time...」%K%P

0x92C
Izumi-san slowly begins to close her eyes...%K%P

0x938
(―Izumi-san!)%K%P

0x944
I try to scream this out...%K%N

0x950
... But instead of words coming out of my mouth...%Noverflowing blood comes out instead.%K%P

0x95C
I embrace Izumi-san's body while covered in rain, mud,%Nand blood.%K%P

0x984
(Hey...)%K%P

0x990
(... Wake up...)%K%P

0x99C
(Wake up... Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x9A8
(... The stars...)%K%P

0x9B4
(I want to see...)%K%P

0x9C0
(The stars with you, Izumi-san!!)%K%P

0x9CC
I embrace her tighter than I've ever held anything ever%Nbefore, as I am assaulted with intense pain that feels%Nlike it's splitting me apart.%K%P

0x9E4
However...%K%P

0x9F8
... Izumi-san has already stopped moving.%K%P

0xA04
Her heavily dangling palm is clutching onto a small%Nfragment of light.%K%P

0xA10
―The bell.%K%N

0xA1C
It's that "bell"...%K%P

0xA28
Before long, the bell begins to quietly slip out of her%Npalm...%K%P

0xA34
... It then...%K%P

0xA80
... slips out and falls.%K%P

0xA8C
I tearfully cling to Izumi-san's back as the trembling of my%Nbody gradually intensifies.%K%P

0xA98
In my arms, I can feel her cold, wet skin...%K%P

0xAA4
Looking at her ghastly pale, almost transparent cheeks,%NI feel like she might shatter into a thousand pieces if I%Ntouched her cheek.%K%P

0xAB0
As if she were a doll made of glass...%K%P

0xAC4
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xAD0
Izumi「I...」%K%P

0xADC
Izumi「I...」%K%P

0xAE8
Izumi「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xAF4
Izumi「I love you...」%K%P

0xB24
At Viewpoint Park...%K%N

0xB30
Under the starry sky...%K%N

0xB3C
Izumi-san told me that.%K%P

0xB48
(... Even so... I...)%K%P

0xB54
(... I wasn't able... to tell her...)%K%P

0xB60
(... that I also felt the same for her...)%K%P

0xB6C
(... Even though...)%K%P

0xB78
(... I loved her...)%K%P

0xB84
Why... didn't I tell her!?%K%P

0xB90
Makoto「Why...」%K%P

0xB9C
My hoarse voice alone fills this empty void.%K%P

0xBA8
My sadness and self-loathing rapidly become more and%Nmore profound.%K%P

0xBB4
This hot rage overwhelms me and brutally snatches%Naway my sense of reasoning.%K%P

0xBC0
I feel as if I've lost my sense of self.%K%P

0xBCC
In the middle of the pelting rain...%K%P

0xBD8
... I soon...%K%N

0xBF4
... Lose... consciousness...%K%P
