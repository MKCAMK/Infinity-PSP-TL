Suddenly... I wake up.%K%P

0x160
It's not that I had a nightmare, or heard a loud sound.%K%P

0x16C
I just somehow woke up for no reason...%K%P

0x178
I take a look at my watch, which I'd placed on my bedside.%K%P

0x184
"2:50 A.M."%K%P

0x190
It hasn't even been an hour since I went to sleep.%K%P

0x19C
But I don't feel sleepy at all.%K%P

0x1A8
My mind is surprisingly wide awake, so I try to do%Nmultiplication tables in my mind to help me go back to%Nsleep.%K%P

0x1B4
I try this countless times...%K%P

0x1C0
It's no use- I'm too alert.%K%P

0x1CC
I give up and get out of bed.%K%P

0x1D8
I'm sure that there's several leftover beer cans from%Ntoday in the fridge.%K%P

0x1E4
After drinking a can, my sleepiness will surely return.%K%P

0x1F0
With that thought, I quietly open the door to my room...%K%P

0x26C
Of course, there's no one in the living room.%K%P

0x278
I let out a sigh in the quiet, empty room.%K%P

0x284
I can hear Okuhiko snoring from up in the loft.%K%P

0x290
Okuhiko「Hey! Wait!」%K%P

0x29C
Okuhiko suddenly shouts in a roaring voice.%K%P

0x2A8
When I look up in surprise...%K%P

0x324
Okuhiko「This is bad... I... don't have... enough... energy...... Zzz...」%K%P

0x338
Okuhiko「Neutrino Energy, Power On! ... Trans～form! ... There! ...%NZzz...」%K%P

0x34C
Okuhiko「You've shown yourself, Mysterious Hi-Tech Vacuum%NCleaner Man... Ugh... He's... sucking... me in... ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x360
Okuhiko「Good work... Zzz...」%K%P

0x374
Okuhiko「Hey! ... Kid! ... Get off of the stage! ... Hey, stop it! ... Don't...%Nlower... that zipper! ... Zzz...」%K%P

0x388
... It seems he's just sleeptalking.%K%P

0x394
(Whew... man, what kind of dream is he having anyway...?)%K%P

0x3A0
I sigh, and start to reach out for the handle to the fridge.%K%P

0x3AC
Just then...%K%P

0x3D4
... I hear a sound.%K%P

0x3E0
It came from the terrace.%K%P

0x3EC
I take my hand off the fridge, and walk straight to the%Nfront door.%K%P

0x468
I put on a pair of sandals, open the door, and go outside.%K%P

0x474
―???%K%P

0x480
There is a dark figure sitting in the corner of the terrace.%K%P

0x48C
A dark figure?%K%P

0x498
No, that's...%K%P

0x4A4
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0x4EC
Yuka「Ah, Makoto...」%K%P

0x4F8
Yuka「Good morning♪」%K%P

0x504
Makoto「Good morning...?」%K%P

0x510
Makoto「What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?」%K%P

0x51C
Yuka「Hmm? Ah... I was just looking at the stars...」%K%P

0x540
The stars??%K%P

0x54C
When I hear that, I look up.%K%P

0x560
Makoto「...!!」%K%P

0x56C
... I can't... speak...%K%P

0x578
The whole sky is engulfed by a glimmering sea of stars.%K%P

0x584
No, that's lame. This isn't something that can be%Ndescribed with such clich▲d lines!%K%P

0x590
There are an infinite amount of shining stars all over the%Nvast sky, packed densely together.%K%P

0x59C
It's a tempest of stardust.%K%P

0x5A8
It feels like if I reached out, I could grab them... but in%Nspite of that, their mysterious shine makes me realize%Njust how far away they are and how they'd take an%Neternity to reach.%K%P

0x5B4
Before I realize it, the miraculous scene in front of me%Nhas left me breathless.%K%P

0x5C0
Yuka「Hey, over here!」%K%P

0x5CC
When I turn to that voice, I see Yuka is now sitting in the%Nmiddle of the short staircase that leads to the ground.%K%P

0x5D8
She lightly beckons me.%K%P

0x610
Accepting Yuka's invitation, I go down the stairs and sit%Ndown next to her.%K%P

0x61C
I look up at the starry sky again.%K%P

0x630
Yuka「Hey? Aren't the stars pretty...?」%K%P

0x63C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x648
I'm so distracted by the tempest of stardust that Yuka's%Nvoice barely registers...%K%P

0x654
Yuka「Wouldn't you say that looking at such a beautiful scene%Njust 'cleanses your heart'?」%K%P

0x660
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x66C
Yuka「Doesn't it?」%K%P

0x678
Yuka「It feels like any depression locked away in your heart is%Njust sucked away and banished to some far-off place.」%K%P

0x684
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x690
Yuka「Now that I think about it, it's the same feeling as when I%Nsaw those cherry blossoms...」%K%P

0x69C
―Cherry blossoms?%K%P

0x6A8
Those words bring me back to reality.%K%P

0x6B4
That's right... when we saw those cherry blossoms... I%Nhave to ask her about "that".%K%P

0x6C0
―Why did she know about the "bell"?%K%P

0x6CC
―Why did she have to take back the "bell" from that%Ngirl?%K%P

0x6D8
―And... does she have that "bell" even now?%K%P

0x6E4
I've been waiting for the chance for the two of us to be%Nall alone.%K%P

0x6F0
Now is my best shot!%K%P

0x704
Makoto「Say, Yuka?」%K%P

0x720
I look at Yuka's face...%K%P

0x750
Yuka「Hmm?」%K%P

0x75C
Yuka's eyes are brimming with tears.%K%P

0x768
Why...!?%K%P

0x774
It feels like my heart is being gripped tightly.%K%P

0x780
I lose sight of my own words...%K%P

0x78C
No, they're stolen... by Yuka's very anguished eyes...%K%P

0x798
Makoto「It's... nothing.」%K%P

0x7A4
I say that by sheer force of will.%K%P

0x7B0
Yuka「Then... I'd like to ask a question... okay?」%K%P

0x7BC
I merely nod quietly while hiding my unrest.%K%P

0x7C8
Yuka「Makoto... why did you chase after me earlier?」%K%P

0x7D4
Makoto「... Earlier?」%K%P

0x7E0
Yuka「When we were at the shrine, looking for Kurumi-chan...」%K%P

0x7EC
Yuka「Even though I insisted that you shouldn't go...」%K%P

0x7F8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x804
Yuka「Why?」%K%P

0x810
Makoto「... That's...」%K%P

0x81C
Makoto「... Because it was the obvious thing to do, right?」%K%P

0x828
Yuka「Why?」%K%P

0x834
Makoto「What do you mean, why?」%K%P

0x840
Yuka「Didn't you think it was dangerous?」%K%P

0x84C
Makoto「... Yeah.」%K%P

0x858
Makoto「It's not like I believed all of Izumi-san's story, but... either%Nway, it still didn't change the fact that it felt like a place%Nno one should approach.」%K%P

0x864
Makoto「At that time, there was no way the man in me could just%Nsilently watch from the sidelines as you went in there by%Nyourself, you know?」%K%P

0x870
Yuka「The man in me, huh...」%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「Wh-What's with that tone...」%K%P

0x888
Yuka「... No.」%K%P

0x894
Yuka「It's just... I thought it sounded... rather old-fashioned...」%K%P

0x8A0
Makoto「It... It may sound old-fashioned, but I really believe in that.」%K%P

0x8AC
Makoto「Men ought to try their best to protect women- that's the%Nway it's been for ages!」%K%P

0x8B8
Yuka「Well then, are you saying you'll try to protect me?」%K%P

0x8C4
Makoto「... That's right.」%K%P

0x8D0
Yuka「That's just stupid...」%K%P

0x8DC
Makoto「It's not stupid!」%K%P

0x8E8
Makoto「From now on, I will definitely protect you!」%K%P

0x8F4
Yuka「... Are you... serious?」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「If this were a joke, it'd be a pretty crappy one, wouldn't%Nit?」%K%P

0x90C
Makoto「I'm serious. I swear on this starry sky that I'm serious!」%K%P

0x918
Even I don't understand why I'm saying these things.%K%P

0x924
Have these brilliant stars bewitched me without me%Nnoticing??%K%P

0x930
I feel a little embarrassed.%K%P

0x93C
Yuka「Hee hee.」%K%P

0x948
Yuka laughs.%K%P

0x954
Despite her cheerful facade, the shine of the stars%Nreflecting in her eyes suggest loneliness in them.%K%P

0x960
Yuka「You're kind...」%K%P

0x96C
Makoto「... Kind?」%K%P

0x978
Yuka「You're the spitting image of him in that regard.」%K%P

0x984
Spitting image...%K%P

0x990
Could that be...?%K%P

0x99C
Makoto「Your ex-boyfriend?」%K%P

0x9A8
Yuka「I told you, he wasn't my boyfriend.」%K%P

0x9B4
Yuka「I said it was an unrequited love, didn't I?」%K%P

0x9C0
She forces a smile.%K%P

0x9CC
It's like she's giving everything she's got to repress%Nemotions that want to burst out of her...%K%P

0x9D8
Yuka「But honestly...」%K%P

0x9E4
Yuka「Honestly... It might not have been like that...」%K%P

0x9F0
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x9FC
Yuka「'It's a completely unrequited love'... I was always under%Nthat impression, but...」%K%P

0xA08
Makoto「???」%K%P

0xA14
Yuka「One time... that boy told me...」%K%P

0xA20
Yuka「He told me he loved me.」%K%P

0xA2C
Makoto「Then that means he really...」%K%P

0xA38
Yuka「No...」%K%P

0xA44
Yuka「An unrequited love is an unrequited love...」%K%P

0xA50
Yuka「That love... is an eternally unrequited one...」%K%P

0xA5C
When she mutters this, Yuka slowly stands up.%K%P

0xA70
I immediately try to call out to her...%K%P

0xA7C
... But give up on it.%K%P

0xA88
Is that turned back of hers trying to hide something from%Nme?%K%P

0xA94
But I don't miss it.%K%P

0xAA0
I don't miss seeing the single teardrop that falls from%NYuka's eyes...%K%P

0xAAC
Yuka「Good night, Makoto...」%K%P

0xAB8
While walking to the terrace, she says this without%Nturning around.%K%P

0xAE0
Before long, I hear the sound of the door closing...%K%P

0xAEC
Left alone, I try touching the wooden plank that Yuka sat%Non.%K%P

0xAF8
The remnants of her tear feel cold on my finger.%K%P

0xB04
(An eternally unrequited love, huh...)%K%P

0xB10
The night wears on.%K%P

0xB1C
The stardust above my head quietly continues to turn%Nwith time...%K%P
