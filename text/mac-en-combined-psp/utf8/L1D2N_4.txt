When I return to the lodge, I take a bath, and once I'm out,%NI decide to try inviting Haruka to my room so I can%Ndirectly ask her about what happened between her and%NSaki.%K%P

0x78
I think asking her straight will be the best way.%K%P

0x84
If I tell her that I saw her and Saki arguing at the pier,%Nthen I can settle this right away.%K%P

0xB4
Makoto「What were you talking to Saki about?」%K%P

0xC0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xCC
Makoto「... It's fine if you don't want to tell me...」%K%P

0xE0
Haruka「I thought she could teach me how to fish... but she%Nwouldn't teach me.」%K%P

0xEC
That's not true.%K%N

0xF8
I clearly understand that. Even so, the words that come%Nout of my mouth are...%K%P

0x104
Makoto「Talk about a spoiled rich girl.」%K%P

0x110
Even though that's not the problem here...%K%P

0x124
Haruka「It's fine... Because I'm different...」%K%P

0x130
Makoto「How so?」%K%P

0x13C
Haruka「Because I have... no heart...」%K%P

0x148
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x154
Haruka「It's fine if I can't fish...」%K

0x4E8
"I-I'll teach you."

0x4F4
"You have no... heart?"

0x19C
Makoto「I-I'll teach you.」%K%P

0x1B8
Haruka「... Really?」%K%P

0x1C4
I give her a nod.%K%N

0x1D0
Now that I think about it, up until now, I've never really%Ntried to learn about Haruka.%K%P

0x1DC
If she wants to learn how to fish, then I'll give her all the%Nhelp she needs.%K%P

0x1E8
I want to get to know her better and%Nstart to understand her feelings.%K%P

0x1F4
I want to understand the depths of the emotions of this%Ngirl who says she has no "heart". After that, won't it be%Nall right to ask her about Saki?%K%P

0x200
That's what I think.%K%P

0x214
Makoto「You have no... heart?」%K%P

0x220
Haruka「... None.」%K%P

0x22C
She "doesn't have a heart"... Just what does that mean?%K%P

0x238
Haruka seems to be dwelling on something by herself.%K%N

0x244
Haruka has never opened her heart to us. Is it because%Nshe really thinks she has no heart? Well then, if that's%Nthe case...%K%P

0x250
Makoto「I'll teach you.」%K%P

0x264
Haruka「... Huh?」%K%P

0x270
Haruka「How to fish. You wanted to learn how to fish, right?」%K%P

0x27C
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x298
Haruka「Will you really teach me?」%K%P

0x2A4
This time, I'm the one to nod. Now that I think about it, up%Nuntil now, I've never really tried to learn about Haruka.%K%P

0x2B0
If she wants to learn how to fish, then I'll give her all the%Nhelp she needs.%K%P

0x2BC
I want to get to know her better and start to understand%Nher feelings.%K%P

0x2C8
I want to understand the depths of the emotions of this%Ngirl who says she has no "heart".%K%P

0x2C8
After that, won't it be all right to ask her about Saki?%NThat's what I think.%K%P

0x2D4
Makoto「Tomorrow, the two of us will go fishing.」%K%P

0x2E0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2EC
Makoto「Right? It's a promise.」%K%P

0x2F8
Haruka「A promise...」%K%P

0x304
Makoto「That's right, a promise.」%K%P

0x310
Haruka「How can we make something like a promise?」%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x328
Haruka「You don't know what will happen tomorrow... right?」%K%P

0x334
Makoto「We'll go tomorrow, no matter what happens. That's what%Nwe've decided.」%K%P

0x340
Haruka「How can you decide that?」%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「That's... because I trust you.」%K%P

0x358
Haruka「Trust...」%K%P

0x364
Makoto「And you trust me too.」%K%P

0x370
Haruka「I trust you too...」%K%P

0x37C
Makoto「That's right. Without mutual trust, a promise means%Nnothing.」%K%P

0x388
Haruka「Mutual trust...」%K%P

0x394
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x3A0
Haruka「So then, you... and I... can trust each other?」%K%P

0x3AC
Makoto「That's right.」%K%P

0x3B8
Makoto「When tomorrow comes, don't forget this promise. Keep it,%Nno matter what happens. All right?」%K%P

0x3CC
Haruka slowly nods.%K%N

0x3D8
It looks like she wanted to say something.%K%P

0x3E4
Like this, she'll learn more and more. Slowly, but surely,%Nher "heart" will be born. Even Haruka should be able to%Nrealize that.%K%P

0x3F0
That's what I think...%K%P
