As I wake up, I kick the covers off the bed with all my%Nstrength.%K%P

0x80
Still half asleep, I blankly stare at the ceiling.%K%P

0x8C
The ceiling looks unfamiliar...%K%N

0x98
It's slanted and made up of several polished wooden%Nboards that are stuck together and equally spaced.%K%P

0xA4
These boards were probably built with no space%Nbetween them. The faint scent of the wood lingers in the%Nair.%K%P

0xB0
I realize I'm freezing, my body soaked with sweat all over.%K%P

0xBC
I take a deep breath and slowly exhale.%K%N

0xC8
The warm scent of wood goes through my nose and fills%Nmy head.%K%P

0xD4
It takes me three more breaths until I reach the point%Nwhere I can realize where I am.%K%P

0xE0
(That's right... I'm at the camp...)%K%P

0x210
I slowly sit up by my bedside.%K%P

0x21C
The sheets that I kicked off are now on the floor.%K%P

0x228
I should pick them up, but I don't have the strength to do%Nso.%K%P

0x234
My whole body feels sluggish.%K%N

0x240
My parched throat begs for water... It feels like I'm waking%Nup with a hangover.%K%P

0x24C
Despite my body's protests, I raise my left arm to check%Nthe time on my watch.%K%P

0x258
The digital reading says...%K%N

0x264
(1 MON 9:17 A.M.) on its display.%K%P

0x270
I lower my arm...%K%N

0x27C
(Whew...)%K%N

0x288
... And take in another deep breath.%K%P

0x294
(What an awful nightmare...)%K%P

0x2A0
―Huh?%K%P

0x2AC
Suddenly, I start to feel a bit worried.%K%P

0x2B8
But why?%K%N

0x2C4
It was just a dream.%K%P

0x2D0
I shouldn't get shaken over some dream!%K%N

0x2DC
Still, deep down, I can't help but feel a little disturbed.%K%P

0x2E8
(... A dream.)%K%P

0x2F4
(But was it really just that...?)%K%P

0x300
(Saturday, April 6th.)%K%P

0x30C
(In five days, huh...)%K%P

0x318
Unconsciously, I start counting the number of days up%Nuntil Saturday on my right hand.%K%P

0x324
(Pffft, what the hell am I doing? I must still be half asleep.)%K%P

0x330
I coldly smirk, mocking myself.%K%P

0x33C
―But, just then!%K%P

0x374
The door to my room is violently thrown open with enough%Nforce to break it.%K%P

0x3C4
Standing in the doorway, I see...%K%N

0x3D0
I see...%K%P

0x3DC
... Um, who is she again?%K%P

0x3E8
All of a sudden, she says something.%K%P

0x3F4
??「Wh... What's going on!?」%K%P

0x400
She sounds like she's frantically chasing after%Nsomething.%K%P

0x40C
??「Why...!?」%K%P

0x418
The girl repeats herself.%K%N

0x424
Obviously, I have no clue what she's talking about.%K%P

0x430
Makoto「... C-Come again?」%K%P

0x43C
I think I sound really stupid, but it's too late to take my%Nwords back.%K%N

0x448
The girl is startled by my reply and takes in a deep%Nbreath.%K%P

0x454
She says nothing, but instead stares directly into my%Neyes.%K%P

0x460
... This is kind of awkward.%K%P

0x46C
It's almost like this one time at the grocery store when a%Nlittle girl I didn't know tightly clinged to my leg while saying "Daddy～♪"...%K%PYeah, this situation feels the same.%K

0xDA8
Try giving her a comforting smile.

0xDB4
Calmly ask her "Did something happen?"

0x4AC
I give her the same comforting smile that I gave to the%Nlittle girl.%K%P

0x4B8
Just then...%K%P

0x4E0
??「Huh...? Is... that it...? So it... was just... that...?」%K%P

0x4EC
Judging by the tone of her voice, I think she's only%Naddressing herself.%K%P

0x4F8
Either way, I still don't know what the hell is going on.%K%P

0x504
??「Then, that was... that was...」%K%P

0x510
Oh, now I get it.%K%P

0x51C
It's so obvious. She's probably still half asleep.%K%P

0x528
When she woke up this morning, she was in a completely%Ndifferent bed with a completely different smell... and a%Ncompletely different lighting...%K%P

0x534
She probably felt like she was still dreaming.%K%P

0x540
It happens a lot when you sleep in a new environment.%K%N

0x54C
After all, I had the same delusion just now...%K%P

0x558
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x564
I ask this, still smiling.%K%P

0x5A4
??「A-Ah... Um...」%K%P

0x5B8
??「... Yes. I'm fine.」%K%P

0x5C4
Makoto「Are you sure? You don't look too well to me.」%K%P

0x5D0
??「You... think so?」%K%P

0x5DC
Makoto「Yeah, your face is really pale.」%K%P

0x5F0
??「Huh?」%K%P

0x5FC
She immediately draws her hand towards her cheek...%K%N

0x610
... But then she unexpectedly bursts into laughter.%K%P

0x61C
??「You say that, Makoto, but looking at your face, you'd%Nthink you just came crawling out from the bottom of a%Ngrave!」%K%P

0x628
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x634
I instantly raise a hand to my cheek, mimicking the girl's%Nprevious action.%K%P

0x640
―Wait, hold on!%K%N

0x64C
I almost missed it.%K%P

0x658
"Makoto".%K%N

0x664
She definitely said that just now. Saying 'Makoto' just%Nlike that...%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Hey, you know...」%K%P

0x684
??「No, it's okay...」%K%P

0x690
The girl interrupts me and continues.%K%P

0x69C
??「Really, it was nothing, so don't worry about it!」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「No, I'm not talking about-」%K%P

0x6BC
??「I'm sorry for suddenly intruding on you like that.」%K%P

0x6C8
??「It's just... how do I put it... I guess you could say I just%Nmade a misunderstanding...」%K%P

0x6DC
??「Right. Well, anyway, please forget that this ever%Nhappened.」%K%P

0x6E8
Makoto「Forget about it?」%K%P

0x6F4
??「If you don't mind. Well then, I'll see you later.」%K%P

0x708
Makoto「W-wait a se-」%K%P

0x76C
But before I could finish, she has already left and%Nclosed the door.%K%P

0x778
Makoto「Hmph... Geez...」%K%P

0x784
Still, doesn't she think she's being a little too familiar with%Nme?%K%P

0x790
"Makoto"... don't go addressing people you barely know%Nwithout a "-kun" or something!%K%P

0x79C
Isn't that really rude? We just met yesterday...%K%P

0x7C0
Makoto「Did something happen?」%K%P

0x7CC
It's at times like this when it's important to stay calm.%K%N

0x7D8
I don't want the situation to get any more awkward...%K%P

0x7E4
Just then...%K%P

0x80C
??「Huh? Was that... it...?」%K%P

0x818
??「Then, in other words, that was...」%K%P

0x824
As she speaks, her eyes wander around the room. She%Nlooks really confused.%K%P

0x830
??「It was just a... 'dream'?」%K%P

0x83C
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x848
Makoto「You're still half asleep, aren't you?」%K%P

0x854
I say this as I give her a sympathetic grin.%K%P

0x894
??「Half asleep...」%K%P

0x8A8
??「... Yeah. That might be it. It seems that way.」%K%P

0x8B4
Although she says that, it looks like she hasn't yet%Ngrasped that this is reality.%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「What kind of dream was it?」%K%P

0x8CC
I ask her this.%K%P

0x8D8
??「Huh?」%K%P

0x8E4
She seems surprised, so I ask again.%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「Your dream. What was it about?」%K%P

0x904
??「R-Right. It was... Well, I don't really remember it all that well.」%K%P

0x910
??「It's weird, though. I felt like I could remember it when I woke%Nup...」%K%P

0x91C
She thoughtfully taps her cheek with her index finger.%K%P

0x928
Makoto「I know what you mean...」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Like when you wake up from a dream cracking up, but%Nthen can't remember what was so funny... or something%Nlike that.」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「All that would be left behind would be a vague, pleasant%Nfeeling...」%K%P

0x954
??「Right, kind of like that. Except, in my case, it wasn't a%Nvery happy one...」%K%P

0x960
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x974
??「... I think it was... hopelessness.」%K%P

0x980
At that moment, her expression becomes dim.%K%P

0x98C
("Hopelessness"...)%K%P

0x998
Now that she mentions it, I also woke up this morning from%Na rather grim "dream"...%K%P

0x9AC
??「But I'm glad.」%K%P

0x9B8
Suddenly, she begins to smile widely.%K%P

0x9C4
??「I'm really glad it was just a dream.」%K%P

0x9D0
Makoto「Huh? But didn't you say you don't remember what%Nhappened in it?」%K%P

0x9DC
??「No, that's not it... How do I put this? I mean that I'm glad%Nthat the dream's finally over...」%K%P

0x9E8
??「Even though I don't remember it, I'm sure it was the worst%Nnightmare I ever had.」%K%P

0x9F4
Looking closely at her, I realize that her entire body is%Nsoaked with sweat.%K%P

0xA00
She looks like a patient who just escaped from a%Nhospital.%K%N

0xA0C
Her face is pale too...%K%P

0xA20
??「Anyway, sorry for suddenly intruding on you.」%K%P

0xA2C
Makoto「No, I don't mind. I myself just woke up as well.」%K%P

0xA40
??「I'm a little embarrassed right now, after spouting all of%Nthat gibberish out of the blue... It's like I was a%Nsleepwalker.」%K%P

0xA4C
She gives me a flustered grin as she tries to comb her%Nmessy bed hair with her right hand.%K%P

0xA58
In return, I smile back.%K%P

0xA6C
??「Let's just say this never happened, okay? This is a%Nsecret between you and me, Makoto.」%K%P

0xA78
After I give a slight nod in agreement, she leaves the%Nroom.%K%P

0xAC4
... ...%N

0xAEC
... Wait, hold on!%K%P

0xAF8
I almost missed it.%K%P

0xB04
"Makoto".%K She definitely said that just now.%K Like we're%Nbest friends, or something...%K%P

0xB10
We only just met yesterday; why are you calling me that%Nwithout a "-kun" or something!?%K%P

0xB38
(Meh, whatever.)%K%P

0xB44
(Maybe she's just that kind of girl...)%K%P

0xB50
(The really friendly type...)%K%P

0xB5C
(Though she seems all right.)%K%P

0xB68
... I stretch, stand up, and begin thinking.%K%P

0xB74
(Um, what did she say her name was again..?)%K%P

0xB80
I definitely think that it started with a "Yu"...%K%N

0xB8C
Yuriko... Yukie... Yumi... Yue... Yuka...%K%P

0xB98
―Yuka...?%K%N

0xBA4
Yeah, that's right! It was "Yuka".%K%P

0xBB0
I remember now.%K%N

0xBBC
She said so when she introduced herself last night.%K%P

0xBC8
And her last name was... "Kawashima"... wasn't it?%K%P

0xBD4
Yuka Kawashima, huh...%K%P

0xBE0
...%K%P

0xBEC
Makoto「Well then...」%K%P

0xBF8
Muttering those words, I head out to the living room.%K%P
