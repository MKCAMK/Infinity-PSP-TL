We pass the time in Viewpoint Park idly.%K%P

0x4C
One person admires the cherry blossoms in full bloom...%NAnother's thoughts turn to what lies beyond the sea...%K%P

0x58
... and yet another person frolics like an innocent child%Nwhile trying to claw their way up the lighthouse...%K%P

0x64
This is the first time I've experienced this "past".%K%P

0x70
A new reality has been born in this time.%K%P

0x7C
History seems to be in the process of steadily changing.%K%P

0x88
In the end, Saki didn't fall into the ocean, and no one%Nlearned about the existence of the Shiki no Mori Shrine.%K%P

0x94
If things continue at this rate, that horrible event will%Nabsolutely never repeat itself.%K%P

0xA0
The future does not advance towards one%Npredetermined course.%K%P

0xAC
It's possible that Izumi-san and I are changing the%Ncourse of history with our intentions.%K%P

0xB8
And in five days, we'll finally escape from this...%K%P

0xC4
From this abominable... infinite loop...%K%P

0x14C
(... From this... infinite loop...)%K%P

0x158
(... Huh?)%K%P

0x164
Suddenly, I feel something bugging me.%K%P

0x170
On the way back to Lunabeach from Viewpoint Park, I%Npurposely slow my pace.%K%P

0x17C
As everyone's retreating figures become smaller, I%Nfreely think to myself.%K%P

0x210
"Infinite loop."%K%N

0x21C
If I think about the situation up until now, that conjecture%Ncertainly seems right.%K%N

0x228
I've been infinitely repeating the days from April 1st to%NApril 6th.%K%N

0x234
That's why all my premonitions during the last loop were%Ncorrect.%K%N

0x240
It's because I had experienced everything before...%K%N

0x24C
I had memories of all of them deep in the nooks of my%Nmind...%K%P

0x260
However, they were all miniscule parts hidden within%Nthose nooks.%K%N

0x26C
In short, the memories I had in the last loop were very%Nfaint fragments.%K%N

0x278
Though I sometimes vaguely recalled things right before%Nthey happened, those moments were rare; it was as if I%Nhad forgotten everything else.%K%N

0x284
—Then why is it that the current me has such%N"complete memories"?%K%N

0x290
...%K%P

0x2A4
In the first place, just what is "memory"?%K%N

0x2B0
What we call a "memory" is something that's etched into%Nyour brain, isn't it?%K%N

0x2BC
If that's the case, then that means my current brain is%Nthe same as my brain just before I time traveled.%K%N

0x2C8
If that weren't it, then I couldn't remember the events of%Nthe last loop.%K%P

0x2DC
To put it simply, me and Izumi's brains were somehow%Ntransported through space-time into our respective%Nskulls...%K%N

0x2E8
... When I think of it like that, I deride myself for having%Nsuch ridiculous thoughts.%K%N%N

0x2F4
(I need to be more serious!)%K%N

0x300
(That wouldn't even make a funny joke!)%K%N%N

0x30C
Although I'm admonishing myself, I try to brainstorm some%Nmore...%K%P

0x320
... But from then on, I just keep repeating the same%Nquestion.%K%N%N

0x32C
(Then why does the current me have "complete%Nmemories"?)%K%N

0x338
(Just where did these clear "memories" come from?)%K%N

0x344
(Haah...)%K%N%N

0x350
No matter how hard I try, I can't even find the thread end%Nof the solution.%K%P

0x3C8
The rest of the group is walking in front of me, the setting%Nsun dying them red.%K%P

0x3D4
I can clearly see the five of them innocently frolicking.%K%P

0x3E0
... Huh? Five of them?%K%P

0x3EC
Now that I think about it, Izumi-san's...%K%P

0x400
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「I-Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x43C
Izumi「Geez, there's no need to be so surprised, is there?」%K%P

0x448
Makoto「... How long... have you been here?」%K%P

0x45C
Izumi「All this time...」%K%P

0x468
Izumi「You didn't notice?」%K%P

0x474
Makoto「N-No... not at all...」%K%P

0x480
Makoto「I was just doing some deep thinking...」%K%P

0x494
Izumi「'Deep thinking'?」%K%P

0x4A0
Makoto「U-Um... err...」%K%P

0x4AC
Makoto「I was thinking about 'memories'...」%K%P

0x4C0
Izumi「Memories?」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「Right, memories.」%K%P

0x4D8
Makoto「I was thinking about how this is probably an infinite loop...」%K%P

0x4E4
Izumi「...?」%K%P

0x4F0
Makoto「Oh, whoops...」%K%P

0x4FC
Makoto「There's no way you'd understand if I said something like%Nthat so suddenly, would you?」%K%P

0x508
Makoto「Umm... hmm... How do I explain this...?」%K%P

0x514
When I think about it, I realize that we haven't really had a%Ndirect conversation since our talk in the car.%K%P

0x520
I have many things I still want to ask her, but there's%Nbeen no chances for us to talk alone yet.%K%P

0x52C
That's why I haven't talked to Izumi-san about the time%Ntravel or the infinite loop...%K%P

0x540
Izumi「Yes, I see.」%K%P

0x54C
Izumi「It's all right... You don't have explain anything. I think I%Nknow what you want to say.」%K%P

0x558
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x56C
Izumi「In other words, it's like this, right?」%K%P

0x578
Izumi「In the last history, your correct premonitions were%Nmemories of events that would occur in the future.」%K%P

0x584
Izumi「The things you remembered were experiences you had%Nfrom the first time you time traveled, so this isn't the first%Ntime you've time traveled.」%K%P

0x590
Izumi「If you begin to think this way, perhaps you've been%Nrepeating the days from April 1st through April 6th for an%Neternity.」%K%P

0x59C
Izumi「In short, this isn't merely time travel...」%K%P

0x5A8
Izumi「... It's an infinite loop.」%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「Right! That's it!」%K%P

0x5C0
Makoto「But I can't explain it with that alone...」%K%P

0x5CC
Izumi「By 'it', you mean 'memories'?」%K%P

0x5D8
Makoto「Yes...」%K%P

0x5E4
Makoto「Even though when I time traveled this time, I had clear%Nmemories of what happened in the past, the time before%Nthat, I forgot about nearly everything...」%K%P

0x5F8
Izumi「And you've been thinking about the reason why this%Nwhole time?」%K%P

0x604
Makoto「... Yes.」%K%P

0x610
Izumi-san's expression has changed suddenly%Ncompared to yesterday. That is to say, it's much clearer.%K%P

0x61C
Her face is so serene, as if she's broken through%Nsomething, or has severed ties with her thoughts...%K%P

0x628
(How can Izumi-san be this calm?)%K%P

0x634
...%K%P

0x640
... Come to think of it, aren't I incredibly calm myself?!%K%P

0x64C
Makoto「Hey, Izumi-san?」%K%P

0x660
Izumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0x66C
Makoto「Is it all right... for us to be like this?」%K%P

0x678
Izumi「Huh?」%K%P

0x684
Makoto「Is it really all right for us to stay this carefree?」%K%P

0x690
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x69C
Makoto「For now, history is changing the way we want it, so if we%Nkeep going at this rate, it feels like this Seminar Camp%Ncan end safely...」%K%P

0x6A8
Makoto「However, in actuality, we don't know a single thing about%Nthe fundamental problem, do we?」%K%P

0x6B4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x6C0
Makoto「First of all, is it all right for us to assume that we can%Nbreak free from this infinite loop, even though we don't%Neven know the cause of time travel?」%K%P

0x6CC
Makoto「If we hadn't fallen from that cliff, then we could never%Nhave time traveled.」%K%P

0x6D8
Makoto「We've always thought this way up until now, but when you%Nthink about it really carefully, we have no guarantee that%Nit's true.」%K%P

0x6E4
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x6F0
Makoto「Yes, that's right... we have no guarantee.」%K%P

0x6FC
Makoto「For all we know, we could time travel again on the 6th at%Nthat time even if we're sleeping in our beds...」%K%P

0x708
Makoto「Nevertheless, in the end, no one knows if we will or won't%Ntime travel.」%K%P

0x71C
Izumi「... Yes, that's right... It might be exactly as you say.」%K%P

0x728
Makoto「Then wouldn't it be best for us to determine the cause of%Nthe time travel as soon as possible?」%K%P

0x734
Makoto「If we don't, then we may never be able to escape from%Nthe infinite loop for all of eternity.」%K%P

0x740
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x74C
Izumi-san stays silent.%K%P

0x758
It's as if she's having trouble finding the right words to%Nsay.%K%P

0x764
Or could it be something else...?%K%P

0x770
Izumi「... Yes... I understand very well what you're saying,%NMakoto-kun.」%K%P

0x784
Izumi「But you know... Hmm... How should I put this...?」%K%P

0x790
Izumi「Anyway, there's two things I have to tell you.」%K%P

0x79C
Makoto「???」%K%P

0x7B0
Izumi「#1:」%K%P

0x7BC
Izumi「About the infinite loop...」%K%P

0x7C8
Izumi「That might be the case for you, Makoto-kun... but what%Nabout me?」%K%P

0x7D4
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x7E0
Izumi「In the last history, I never had any premonitions.」%K%P

0x7EC
Izumi「That's because I didn't have any memories like that%Nwithin me...」%K%P

0x7F8
Izumi「In other words, to me, this is the first time...」%K%P

0x804
Izumi「This is the first time I've time traveled...」%K%P

0x810
Makoto「... When you put it that way... that certainly... seems true...」%K%P

0x81C
Izumi「#2:」%K%P

0x828
Izumi「Makoto-kun, you said that it would be best if we%Ndetermined the cause of the time travel... That's what%Nyou think, right?」%K%P

0x834
Makoto「Yes...」%K%P

0x848
Izumi「But you know what? There's no need to do that.」%K%P

0x854
Makoto「... W-Why not!?」%K%P

0x860
Izumi「Because...」%K%P

0x87C
Izumi「... I've already determined it.」%K%P

0x888
Makoto「Wh... What!?」%K%P

0x894
Izumi「When I was thinking about it last night, I finally found the%Nanswer.」%K%P

0x8A0
Izumi「Of course, I had considered it was a possibility before%Nthat...」%K%P

0x8B4
Izumi「It was on the night of the 5th... Remember how I tried to%Ntalk to you about your premonitions?」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x8D4
Izumi「But that alone couldn't explain everything about the%Ntime travel.」%K%P

0x8E0
Izumi「For example, the 'memories' you were talking about%Nearlier.」%K%P

0x8EC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x8F8
Izumi「But now I feel like I somehow understand it...」%K%P

0x904
Izumi「And when this morning came, I was finally able to explain%Nall of the mysteries.」%K%P

0x910
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x924
Izumi「The cause of the time travel...」%K%P

0x930
Izumi「It's...」%K%P

0x93C
I instinctively take a deep breath.%K%P

0x948
I'm preparing my body for every single word that%NIzumi-san is going to say.%K%P

0x954
A tense moment arrives... Even my heart has stopped.%K%P

0x960
—However!%K%P

0x96C
Yuka「Heey!」%K%P

0x978
Yuka「Izumi-san! Makoto!」%K%P

0x9A0
We can hear Yuka's voice from far away, on the other%Nside of the road...%K%P

0x9AC
It seems she's running this way.%K%P

0x9B8
Makoto「Dammit! Why at such an important time!?」%K%P

0x9C4
Yuka「Hey! Izumi-san!」%K%P

0x9D8
Izumi「It can't be helped...」%K%P

0x9E4
Izumi「We'll just have to continue this conversation later...」%K%P

0x9F8
Just then, Yuka appears from the other side of a sharp%Nturn.%K%P

0xA0C
Yuka「Geez, you two are walking so slow!」%K%P

0xA28
Izumi「That's not it.」%K%P

0xA34
Izumi「You're just too fast.」%K%P

0xA48
Yuka「Huh, really?」%K%P

0xA5C
Yuka「Wait, that doesn't matter!」%K%P

0xA68
Yuka「Anyway, hurry up and come this way♪」%K%P

0xA98
With that, Yuka grabs Izumi-san's hand, and begins to%Nbreak off into a run again.%K%P

0xAA4
Yuka「Hey, Makoto, you hurry up too!」%K%P

0xAB0
Izumi「H-Hold on... What is it, Yuka-chan?」%K%P

0xABC
Yuka「It's amazing♪ It's so amazing♪」%K%P

0xAC8
Izumi「'Amazing'... what's amazing?」%K%P

0xAD4
Yuka「They're leaping♪ There's so many of them♪」%K%P

0xAE0
Izumi「What? I can't guess it from that.」%K%P

0xAEC
Yuka「It's fine, it's fine♪ You'll know when you see it♪」%K%P

0xAF8
Izumi「Oh geez...」%K%P

0xB20
Before long...%K%N

0xB2C
... Izumi-san and Yuka disappear down the curved road.%K%P

0xB38
I've been left behind...%K%P

0xB44
Suddenly, when I look down at my feet, I see the%N"fragment of concrete" lying in a corner of the road.%K%P

0xB50
It's the piece that I used last night to destroy (well, tried%Nto destroy) the bell.%K%P

0xB6C
(Now that I think about it... where...)%K%P

0xB78
(Where is that bell... right now?)%K%P

0xB84
(Is it related to the cause of the time travel?)%K%P

0xB90
"Time travel."%K

0xB9C
"The infinite loop."%K%N

0xBA8
"The mystery of our memories."%K

0xBB4
"The true nature of the bell."%K%P

0xBC0
The mysteries just keep intensifying the more I mull over%Nthem.%K%P

0xBCC
(I wonder what's on Izumi-san's mind right now.)%K%P

0xBD8
(Has she really found the key to solving all of these%Nmysteries?)%K%P

0xBE4
The serenity that I felt just a short time ago vanishes%Ninto thin air, as if it never existed.%K%P

0xBF0
Illuminated by the setting sun, a slick movement on the%Neastern ocean catches my eye.%K%P

0xBFC
The black waves repeatedly surge forward, headed%Ntowards the shore.%K%P

0xC24
Several dozen dolphin's heads bob out of the waves...%K%P

0xC30
Seeing the dolphins playing around in the waves makes%Nme feel somewhat jealous...%K%P

0xC78
... ... ...%K%P
