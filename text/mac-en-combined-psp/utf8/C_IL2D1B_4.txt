After that...%K%N

Yuka and I go shopping for rice.%K%P

0x11C
Haruka and I go shopping for rice.%K%P

0x130
Saki and I go shopping for rice.%K%P

After we finish Izumi-san's meal, we go to the pool at%NTsukiya Hotel, where an earthquake happens, just like%Nthe last 1st.%K%N

0x148
Of course, Izumi-san avoids falling into the pool this time,%Nbut we end up being chased around by the security%Nguard again anyway.%K%P

0x15C
When we return to Lunabeach from Tsukiya Hotel, we tell%Neach other stories, tell each other stupid jokes, and%Nbefore we know it, we're all chatting like the best of%Nfriends despite it only being our first meeting.%K%N

0x168
No... now that I think about it, it might only be natural.%K%N

0x174
After all, to Izumi-san and I, this isn't our first meeting.%K%N

0x180
Before long...%K%P

0x194
「"... Oh! If that's the case, then I've got an idea!」%K%N

0x1A0
「"Why don't we try going to the pool tomorrow?」%K%N%N

0x1AC
We promise to go to the pool tomorrow, and leave%NLunabeach...%K%N

0x1B8
... ... ...%K%P

0x1C4
In the end, I've decided to do everything I can to try%Nletting these six days pass by without changing much.%K%N

0x1D0
Still, there are a few things I want to interfere with.%K%N

0x1DC
There are some events that I don't want to happen%Ntwice... For example, Saki getting swallowed by that%Nmonstrous wave, Saki and Haruka's fight... I have no%Nintention of letting things like that happen again.%K%P

0x1F0
There's also that one horrific event that I don't ever%Nwant to happen again...%K%N

0x1FC
―I must prevent that terrible conclusion no matter%Nwhat, if nothing else!%K%N%N

0x208
But this is something that doesn't concern the others.%K%N

0x214
This is me and Izumi-san's problem alone...%K%N

0x220
That's why I can't get the others involved.%K%P

0x234
If Izumi-san and I cooperate, then it should be nearly%Nimpossible for that horrible event to happen again.%K%N%N

0x240
Judging from Izumi-san's state today, it seems she's%Nprobably thinking the same thing I am.%K%P

0x254
Now that we've confirmed that we "time traveled", we%Nknow that getting flustered won't help anything.%K%N%N

0x260
We were suddenly thrown into this incomprehensible,%Nstrange world, but nevertheless, nothing will be solved if%Nall we do is hesitate and worry.%K%P

0x274
Anyway, I've got to try to stay positive.%K%N%N

0x280
"The reason for the time travel" and "the cause me%Ngetting stuck in the infinite loop"...%K%N%N

0x28C
There's still a lot of mysteries left, but at least, there's a%Nlot less compared to the number I had this morning.%K%N

0x298
If I continue to move forward carefully one step at a time,%Nthen, sooner or later, all the mysteries will probably be%Nunravelled.%K%P

0x2AC
Though I've no basis for this theory, I'm starting to%Nbelieve that it's true; as it is, I'm stumped about the%Ncurrent state of affairs.%K%N

0x2B8
Still, I ought to keep my mind open to other possibilities...%K%P

0x430
The next day...%K%N

0x43C
As promised, we go to the pool.%K%P

0x458
Like last time, only Kurumi stays behind at Lunabeach,%Npretending to be sick.%K%P

0x46C
Like last time, only Kurumi stays behind at Lunabeach,%Nsaying she has a headache.%K%P

0x478
At the pool, despite me and Izumi-san's efforts, Yuka%Ndrinks a lot of beer.%K%P

0x484
Naturally, when we get back to the shop, Yuka...%K%P

0x490
Yuka「To... To... To...」%K%P

0x49C
Yuka「Toro.」%K%P

0x4A8
Yuka「Eye wanna eat toro...」%K%P

0x4B4
Yuka「I wanna eat shum toro!!」%K%P

0x4C0
... turns into a nearly uncontrollable, intoxicated%Ndrunkard...%K%P

0x4CC
However, in spite of that, there's no way we can go along%Nwith Yuka's selfish request.%K%P

0x4D8
If we did that, then Saki might nearly drown again.%K%P

0x4E4
Izumi-san and I manage to talk her out of it, and we invite%Neveryone to go see the cherry blossoms instead.%K%P

0x500
