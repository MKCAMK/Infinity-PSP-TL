Makoto「Well then... now we can talk all we want, right?」%K%P

0x68
Yuka and I are sitting down on the bench at the tennis%Ncourt.%K%P

0x74
Makoto「Is it all right if I ask you something?」%K%P

0x80
Makoto「Why can't we tell the others? You must have some sort%Nof reason that means we need to keep it a secret...」%K%P

0x94
Yuka「Yes... But before that, I think it'd be best if we first%Nstraightened several things out.」%K%P

0xA0
Yuka「I have a feeling that there are lots and lots of things%Nthat we still misunderstand or don't comprehend at all,%Nlike...」%K%P

0xAC
Yuka「'Just what did we experience, and what are we%Nthinking?'...」%K%P

0xB8
Yuka「If we don't reach a mutual understanding first, our%Nconversations will clash, and then we'll have no idea%Nwhat the other's saying, right?」%K%P

0xC4
Well... she might be right.%K%P

0xD0
I give Yuka a deep nod, and wait for her to start off...%K%P

0xDC
Yuka「All right then. First off, let's confirm what we do know,%Nokay?」%K%P

0xE8
Makoto「Yeah.」%K%P

0xF4
Yuka「I think there's three things that we can definitely say for%Nsure.」%K%P

0x15C
Yuka「#1—You and I share the same memories from April 1st%Nto the 6th...」%K%P

0x19C
Yuka「#2—Today's date is definitely Monday, April 1st...」%K%P

0x1D4
Yuka「#3—On the last April 1st, we had the same dream...」%K%P

0x21C
Makoto「Hey, Yuka? Don't make this more complicated than it%Nactually is.」%K%P

0x228
Makoto「In short, this is what you want to say, right?」%K%P

0x234
Makoto「On Saturday, April 6th, we time traveled at that shrine to%NMonday, April 1st... in other words, to today...」%K%P

0x240
Yuka「Mmm... time travel, huh...」%K%P

0x24C
Makoto「... You don't think it's something else, do you?」%K%P

0x28C
Yuka「No, there's no way that it's something else...」%K%P

0x298
Yuka「It's just, do you really think that this is a simple problem%Nthat can be explained by those two words...?」%K%P

0x2A4
Makoto「Hmm?」%K%P

0x2B0
Yuka「The three facts we know right now... if all we knew were #1%Nand #2, then it'd probably be all right just to say that it%Nwas 'time travel', but...」%K%P

0x2BC
Yuka「The most important one is #3...」%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「That we had the same dream on the last April 1st?」%K%P

0x2D4
Yuka「Yes... And if I had to say my thoughts on why, then my%Nanswer would be...」%K%P

0x2E8
Yuka「To us, this wasn't the first time we've experienced time%Ntravel... that's the truth of the matter, right?」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x300
Yuka「In other words, we've time traveled before, haven't we?」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x318
Yuka「Which means that this should be the third time we've%Nexperienced today, the day known as 'Monday, April 1st',%Ncorrect?」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「'The last April 1st' and 'today'... and the 'forgotten April%N1st' that happened before our dream...」%K%P

0x340
Yuka「Yeah... That's what I thought, but...」%K%P

0x34C
Yuka「... Makoto, what day do you think it was before that%N'forgotten April 1st'?」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「That'd be March 31st, obviously...」%K%P

0x364
Yuka「You think so?」%K%P

0x370
Makoto「?」%K%P

0x37C
Yuka「You really think so?」%K%P

0x388
Makoto「What do you want to say?」%K%P

0x3D4
Yuka「I think that the day before the 'forgotten April 1st' was%Nactually the '6th'.」%K%P

0x3E0
Makoto「Huh???」%K%P

0x3EC
Yuka「Truthfully, we have no clue how many times we've been%Nthrough today, 'April 1st'.」%K%P

0x448
Yuka「Even though this is at least the third time, this might%Nactually be the 300th time, or the 300 millionth time...」%K%P

0x454
Yuka「So trying to count the number of times itself might be%Npointless...」%K%P

0x460
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0x46C
Yuka「Perhaps... we've been repeating the days from April 1st%Nthrough the 6th countless times for all eternity.」%K%P

0x478
Yuka「If there's no beginning, then there's no end—this is%Ndefinitely a part of an infinite loop!」%K%P

0x48C
An infinite loop...%K%P

0x498
I'm having a hard time taking it in.%K%P

0x4A4
An infinite loop...%K%P

0x4B0
The word repeats itself in my head.%K%P

0x4BC
If that's the case...%K%P

0x4C8
If that's the case... then does that mean we're doomed to%Nrepeat the last six days for all eternity?%K%P

0x4D4
We'll continue living in this world for our whole lives...%K%P

0x4E0
No, that's not an accurate way of putting it.%K%P

0x4EC
It's not like our physical bodies traveled through time%Nwith us.%K%P

0x4F8
Only our consciousnesses have returned to the%Nmorning of the 1st.%K%P

0x504
Which means that it's completely impossible for our%Nbodies to age.%K%P

0x510
If we can't age, then our bodies will never rot away.%K%P

0x51C
In other words, we... won't die?%K%P

0x528
—That's wrong!%K%P

0x570
—We CAN'T die!%K%P

0x57C
Suddenly, I'm hit with a sense of intense despair.%K%P

0x588
It's a dark world without even a single ray of light.%K%P

0x594
Time will continue to repeat itself...%K%P

0x5A0
Are you saying that I have to continue living on%Nendlessly for all eternity in this world, in this time!?%K%P

0x5AC
Something like that... is nothing short of despair!%K%P

0x5B8
What will happen to my future!?%K%P

0x5C4
My prospects!?%K%N

0x5D0
My dreams!?%K%N

0x5DC
My hopes!?%K%P

0x5E8
It's like I'm stuck in a prison!%K%P

0x5F4
I'm chained down in this small cell where everything%Nrepeats without change.%K%P

0x600
Where everything repeats without change.%K%N

0x60C
Where everything repeats without change.%K%N

0x618
Where everything repeats without change.%K%P

0x624
Where day after day continues monotonously...%K%P

0x630
And then...%K%P

0x660
...I feel a pain that could gouge out my heart.%K%P

0x66C
I can't escape... from this pain.%K%P

0x678
I've failed to save her thousands, if not tens of%Nthousands, of times...%K%P

0x684
I broke my promise.%K%P

0x690
All because I hesitated for that one moment...%K%P

0x69C
That's right...! At that time, it happened because I thought%Nof "that"!%K%P

0x6A8
I thought of myself first!%K%P

0x6B4
It's because I held my own life dear!%K%P

0x6C0
So the one...%K%P

0x6CC
—The one who killed Yuka was me!%K%P

0x6D8
I've killed her thousands, if not tens of thousands, of%Ntimes!!%K%P

0x6E4
And from this point onwards, I will continue to kill her%Ncountless times for all eternity!!%K%P

0x6F0
I will continue to shed blood!!%K%P

0x6FC
That's...%K%P

0x708
That's... simply...%K%P

0x740
I gnash my teeth with a grinding noise.%K%P

0x74C
The pain in my chest seems to burst open.%K%P

0x758
Everything... all of these memories... I want to erase them%Nand be rid of them...%K%P

0x764
All of them...%K%P

0x770
(Isn't that just escaping?)%K%P

0x77C
(Am I really planning to run away like that?)%K%P

0x788
(I'm such... a goddamn coward...)%K%P

0x794
"If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid."%K%P

0x7A0
—I'll fight!%K%P

0x7AC
Even if it's a predetermined fate...%K%P

0x7B8
... I'll just shatter it into pieces!%K%P

0x7C4
I'll destroy such a ridiculous fate!%K%P

0x7D0
—I'll break out!%K%N

0x7DC
—I'll break out from this hellish cell!%K%P

0x7E8
—From within the darkness of this infinite loop!%K%N

0x7F4
—I'll tear off these chains!%K%P

0x800
I'll never repeat this again!%K%P

0x80C
"I will definitely protect Yuka."%K%P

0x818
I can't... break that oath... ever again...%K%P

0x864
I firmly grab Yuka's arm.%K%P

0x870
And like that, I keep pulling her arm as I begin to walk...%K%P

0x87C
Yuka「H-Hold on... Where are we going?」%K%P

0x888
Makoto「We're running away...」%K%P

0x894
Yuka「R-Running away...? Where to?」%K%P

0x8A0
Makoto「That's obvious, isn't it...?」%K%P

0x8AC
Yuka「???」%K%P

0x8B8
Makoto「To the free world...」%K%P

0x910
Yuka「Huh? ... The harbor?」%K%P

0x91C
Yuka「Wait, do you mean...?」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「That's right. We're going home.」%K%P

0x934
Yuka「H-How?」%K%P

0x940
Makoto「We'll take the ferry... Isn't that obvious?」%K%P

0x954
Yuka「But Makoto—」%K%P

0x960
Makoto「I'll buy us tickets, so wait here for a bit!」%K%P

0x974
I leave Yuka, and run towards the ferry boarding area...%K%P

0x9A8
I go to the ticket booth window.%K%P

0x9B4
A notice set up against it quickly catches my eye.%K%P

0x9C0
"Today, ferry service has been suspended due to bad%Nweather."%K%P

0x9CC
Makoto「Bad weather?? But it's so nice right now. What's going%Non??」%K%P

0x9D8
I peek into the office next to the window.%K%P

0x9E4
No one's inside...%K%P

0x9F0
Makoto「Damn.」%K%P

0x9FC
I click my tongue, and run over to a nearby docked%Nfishing boat.%K%P

0xA30
There is a lone fisherman on the boat's deck, performing%Nmaintenance...%K%P

0xA3C
I call out in an eager voice.%K%P

0xA48
Makoto「Excuse me! Please let me borrow that boat!」%K%P

0xA54
Fisherman「Huh!? What're yah sayin'!?」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「No, umm... I want to go out on the fishing boat just once!」%K%P

0xA6C
Fisherman「What, yah goin' fishing?」%K%P

0xA78
Makoto「No, that's not it... I... I want to return to the mainland!」%K%P

0xA84
Fisherman「Oh, yah got some business yah got tah do on the%Nmainland, huh?」%K%P

0xA90
Makoto「W-Well, something like that. That's why—」%K%P

0xA9C
Fisherman「Ah... but that's too bad.」%K%P

0xAA8
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xAB4
Fisherman「Long story short, there's gonna be some bad weather%Nrollin' in.」%K%P

0xAC0
Makoto「Bad weather...? Even though it's so clear?」%K%P

0xACC
Fisherman「Right. A bad trop's comin' in from the open sea.」%K%P

0xAD8
Makoto「'Trop'?」%K%P

0xAE4
Fisherman「I mean a tropical cyclone.」%K%P

0xAF0
Fisherman「After all, this is the season for one of those.」%K%P

0xAFC
Fisherman「Umm... what's it called... El, El, El...」%K%P

0xB08
Makoto「...?」%K%P

0xB14
Fisherman「Right! It's cuz of the El Nyo Nyo.」%K%P

0xB20
Makoto「El Nino...」%K%P

0xB2C
Fisherman「Oh! That's right... the Ero Ninyo, right?」%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「It's El Nino...」%K%P

0xB44
Fisherman「En Nyo Nyoro?」%K%P

0xB50
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xB5C
Fisherman「Well, whatever the name is, it doesn't really matter...」%K%P

0xB68
Fisherman「Anyway, it's because of it that we're gettin' bad weather%Nfrom the ocean.」%K%P

0xB74
Makoto「But...」%K%P

0xB80
Fisherman「Huh? That face... yah don't believe what I said, do yah?」%K%P

0xB8C
Makoto「It's not that I don't believe you... It's just...」%K%P

0xB98
Fisherman「Just what?」%K%P

0xBA4
Makoto「If it's just a little bit of bad weather, then it doesn't seem%Nlike it's impossible to go...」%K%P

0xBB0
Fisherman「D-Dumbass!!!」%K%P

0xBBC
The fisherman shouts with an absurdly loud voice.%K%P

0xBC8
Fisherman「Don't... don't underestimate the ocean!」%K%P

0xBD4
Fisherman「Yah know nothin' about the ocean, so don't get so%Nconceited...」%K%P

0xBE0
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xBEC
Fisherman「Well, when tomorrow comes, yah can see fer yerself.」%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「Tomorrow...?」%K%P

0xC04
Fisherman「Right. Tomorrow, yah can see that there'll be some huge%Nwaves comin'.」%K%P

0xC10
Tomorrow — April 2nd.%K%P

0xC1C
That was the day Saki was swallowed by that large wave.%K%P

0xC28
This fisherman is right.%K%P

0xC34
Fisherman「Come on, yah're gettin' in the way of mah work! If yah've%Ngot no business with me, then scram!」%K%P

0xC40
The fisherman seems to have been angered by my%Nthoughtless words.%K%P

0xC4C
It feels... like I should apologize to him.%K%P

0xC58
Makoto「S-Sorry...」%K%P

0xC64
I give the fisherman a deep bow, then turn away...%K%P
