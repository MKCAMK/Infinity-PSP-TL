Everyone quietly cleans up, and carries the tools back%Nto Lunabeach.%K%P

0x78
The four of us split up with Izumi-san and Kurumi at%NLunabeach, and decide to return to the lodge.%K%P

0x84
On the way back... Yuka suddenly whispers into my ear.%K%P

0x98
Yuka「Hey, hey.」%K%P

0xA4
Yuka「I want to talk to you for a bit.」%K%P

0xB0
Makoto「Huh? S-Sure...」%K%P

0xC4
Yuka「It'd be better if we were alone.」%K%P

0xD8
Yuka「Sorry! Okuhiko-kun, Haruka-chan, could you go on%Nahead?」%K%P

0xE4
It seems as if Okuhiko has presumed something after%Nwatching us talk, as he quickly obliges and escorts%NHaruka away.%K%P

0x108
... ... ...%K%P

0x11C
Yuka「It got pretty bad back there, didn't it?」%K%P

0x128
Makoto「You're right...」%K%P

0x134
Yuka「I wonder if I shouldn't have gotten so drunk?」%K%P

0x140
Makoto「You probably would have anyway, since that's normal%Nfor you.」%K%P

0x154
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x160
Makoto「By the way, what did you want to talk about?」%K%P

0x174
Yuka「Right, the truth is... I was thinking of going to go see the%Ncherry blossoms...」%K%P

0x180
Makoto「Didn't you say you went this morning?」%K%P

0x18C
Yuka「But it's boring to go by yourself...」%K%P

0x198
Yuka「So I thought I'd ask you and see if you wanted to come%Nalong...」%K%P

0x1A4
Makoto「What... so in the end, you never went?」%K%P

0x1B0
Yuka「Right.」%K%P

0x1BC
Makoto「Well, it's still pretty gloomy here, so a change of scenery%Nwould be nice.」%K%P

0x1D0
Yuka「Really? Then let's go♪」%K%P

0x230
It's the very picture of a wide, blue sky.%K%P

0x23C
The springtime haze is hanging in the air all across the%Nsea, making a yacht traveling across the water seem%Nlike an illusion as it creates whitecaps.%K%P

0x248
The fluttering balmy breeze sways Yuka's hair.%K%P

0x254
The sight of her mussed up hair brushing her cheeks is%Nrather attractive.%K%P

0x260
We continue walking by the cool morning coastline%Ntowards the cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0x26C
Makoto「Say, Yuka? You said that we'd all be gathering at 5:00,%Ndidn't you...?」%K%P

0x280
Yuka「Yes.」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「... Sounds like there's some sort of plan.」%K%P

0x2A0
Yuka「Hmm...」%K%P

0x2B4
Yuka「... That's a S-E-C-R-E-T♪」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「Huh? Seriously, what is it?」%K%P

0x2CC
Yuka「Hee hee... do you want me to tell you?」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「Dumbass! Why else would I be asking!?」%K%P

0x2EC
Yuka「Ah! I'm not liking this attitude of yours...」%K%P

0x2F8
Makoto「Fine then. It's not like I really wanted to hear it anyway.」%K%P

0x30C
Yuka「Wow, you're starting to pout again.」%K%P

0x318
Makoto「I'm not pouting!」%K%P

0x32C
Yuka「Yes you are!」%K%P

0x340
Yuka「The Second Law of Professor Yuka's Love Formula:%N'Audacity is essential for guys'.」%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「That again...」%K%P

0x360
Yuka「If you give up immediately and pout like that, your long%Nawaited chance that's just one step away will escape%Nfrom you!」%K%P

0x36C
Makoto「But Yuka, didn't you say that the 'First Law of your Love%NFormula' was to 'dislike persistent men'?」%K%P

0x380
Yuka「That was that! This is this!」%K%P

0x394
Yuka「In times when you should push through, push through%Nuntil the end, and in times when you should back off,%Nback off quickly... that's what it means! Got it?」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Yeah, yeah...」%K%P

0x3AC
Makoto「So then, what are we planning to do when we gather at%N5:00?」%K%P

0x3C0
Yuka「Hee hee... do you want me to tell you?」%K%P

0x3CC
Makoto「Yes! I've been saying all day that I... ............ would%Nappreciate it if you would so kindly tell me.」%K%P

0x3D8
I try to keep my frustration at bay.%K%P

0x3EC
Yuka「Very well. Since you've gone this far to say it, I shall tell%Nyou.」%K%P

0x400
Yuka「The truth is, we'd thought we'd try having a barbecue on%NPrincess Beach tonight.」%K%P

0x40C
Makoto「Huh? A barbecue?」%K%P

0x418
Yuka「Yep♪」%K%P

0x424
Makoto「T-That's it?」%K%P

0x438
Yuka「That's it.」%K%P

0x444
Makoto「Geez, that's not something you needed to go that far to%Nhide, did you!?」%K%P

0x450
Yuka「Right, it wasn't.」%K%P

0x45C
Makoto「Then why!?」%K%P

0x470
Yuka「Well, because you're so easy to tease. I just wanted to%Ntry lording it over you for a bit.」%K%P

0x47C
Makoto「Y-You...」%K%P

0x490
Yuka「Besides, Makoto, you were so cute♪」%K%P

0x49C
Makoto「Cute!?」%K%P

0x4B0
Yuka「Yeah. It was really cute how desperate you looked♪」%K%P

0x4C4
Yuka「It was kinda... like a newborn puppy!」%K%P

0x4E8
Haah... the teasing never seems to cease...%K%P

0x4F4
As she walks next to me, an expression that can only%Nbe described as bliss starts to rise to her face...%K%P

0x5EC
In an instant, her blissful smile somehow melts away all of%Nmy irritation.%K%P

0x5F8
At the same time, we've arrived here... in other words, at%Nthe row of cherry blossom trees.%K%P

0x604
Countless petals flutter down and scatter...%K%P

0x610
The gentle breeze blowing through the tree lined street%Nis faintly dyed pink.%K%P

0x61C
As if trying to ascertain something, Yuka slowly takes%Ntwo steps and stands on a pile of petals.%K%P

0x628
She remains silent, and it's as if she's completely%Nforgotten my existence, even though I'm standing next%Nto her...%K%P

0x634
Just what is Yuka looking at in the blizzard of cherry%Nblossoms that have completely engulfed her?%K%P

0x640
Somehow, I feel it would be inappropriate for me to call%Nout to her right here, right now, so I remain silent and walk%Nup next to her.%K%P

0x64C
I cough because of the rich fragrance of the cherry%Nblossoms wafting around me...%K%P

0x680
Yuka「Hey, Makoto...?」%K%P

0x68C
While gazing at the petals flowing in the wind, Yuka%Nsuddenly asks me a question.%K%P

0x698
Yuka「... When was your first love?」%K

0x2F08
A long time ago.

0x2F14
In middle school.

0x2F20
In high school.

0x6E8
Makoto「A long time ago... I think I was still in elementary school.」%K%P

0x6F4
Makoto「So... I don't really remember it that well.」%K%P

0x700
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x70C
Makoto「What about you, Yuka? When was your first love?」%K%P

0x718
Yuka「Mine...」%K%P

0x724
Yuka「Mine was... in middle school...」%K%P

0x730
Yuka「Even now, I can't forget it...」%K%P

0x73C
Yuka「I met my first love in spring, when I was in 9th grade...」%K%P

0x750
Makoto「I think it was in middle school? I don't really remember it%Nthat well, but...」%K%P

0x75C
I give her a vague answer.%K%P

0x768
Truth is, I do remember, but it's not really something I want%Nto talk about...%K%P

0x774
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x780
Makoto「What about you, Yuka? When was your first love?」%K%P

0x78C
Yuka「Same...」%K%P

0x798
Yuka「Mine was also... when I was in middle school...」%K%P

0x7A4
Yuka「But even now, I still remember it quite well.」%K%P

0x7B0
Yuka「I met my first love in spring, when I was in 9th grade...」%K%P

0x7C4
Makoto「It was in high school. I was kind of a late bloomer, huh...?」%K%P

0x7D0
I say this with an embarrassed grin.%K%P

0x7DC
But it can't be helped. It's the truth...%K%P

0x7E8
It wasn't until then that I began to discover what "having%Nfeelings for someone" really meant.%K%P

0x7F4
I suppose I had cases of "puppy love" once or twice%Nbefore, but that was it.%K%P

0x800
Yuka「I see...」%K%P

0x80C
Makoto「What about you, Yuka? When was your first love?」%K%P

0x818
Yuka「Mine...」%K%P

0x824
Yuka「Mine was... in middle school...」%K%P

0x830
Yuka「It was just a little earlier than you, but I think compared%Nto the others around me, it was much later.」%K%P

0x83C
Yuka「It started in the spring, when I was in 9th grade...」%K%P

0x860
Yuka「It was the day of the opening ceremony in April, when the%Nnew semester started...」%K%P

0x86C
Yuka takes in a deep breath...%K%P

0x878
... and lets out a long sigh.%K%P

0x884
Before long, she begins to talk about that incident in%Nspring...%K%P

0x8D4
Yuka「I think it was the same everywhere, but the entire school%Nwas in a completely blissful state all day in anticipation%Nof a new beginning.」%K%P

0x8E0
Yuka「My class changed, with a new homeroom teacher going%Naround...」%K%P

0x8EC
Yuka「The freshmen wearing their brand new, baggy uniforms%Nwere looking around the school restlessly.」%K%P

0x8F8
Yuka「Even when morning classes ended, it was like no one%Neven thought about going home.」%K%P

0x904
Yuka「They would wander around the school, looking for their%Nfriends who had been assigned to other classes, and%Ncheerfully tried to get the shy and quiet kids to%Nsocialize...」%K%P

0x910
Yuka「You know what I mean, right? The day of the opening%Nceremony, that is...」%K%P

0x91C
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x928
Yuka「But you know what? For some reason, I just couldn't get%Ninto the same mood everyone else was in.」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Was something on your mind?」%K%P

0x940
Yuka「No. That wasn't it...」%K%P

0x94C
Yuka「It's just... how do I put it... while everyone else were all in%Nhigh spirits, I was melancholic for no real reason, I%Nguess?」%K%P

0x958
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x964
Yuka「That's what I thought.」%K%P

0x970
Yuka「But it might have been because I was a little depressed%Nabout entering my final year of middle school.」%K%P

0x97C
Makoto「I see...」%K%P

0x988
Yuka「Because I felt that way, when homeroom activities%Nended, I immediately said goodbye to everyone, and%Nheaded for the usual place.」%K%P

0x994
Makoto「'The usual place'?」%K%P

0x9A0
Yuka「... The art room.」%K%P

0x9AC
Yuka「It's not like I was a member of the art club or anything like%Nthat...」%K%P

0x9B8
Yuka「But anyway... I loved that place...」%K%P

0x9C4
Yuka「I would go to that place and draw pictures...」%K%P

0x9D0
Makoto「Draw...?」%K%P

0x9DC
Yuka「Yeah. I forgot exactly when, but when I felt like it, I went to%Nthe art room and started drawing pictures.」%K%P

0x9E8
Yuka「Up until I entered middle school, I'd never drawn before,%Nbut when I started going to the art room like that, for%Nsome reason, I got this desire to draw a lot of pictures...」%K%P

0x9F4
Yuka「No matter what time it was, it was always so silent and%Nstill in there...」%K%P

0xA00
Yuka「Sketching pictures in that silent and empty place%Nsoothed me for some reason.」%K%P

0xA0C
Yuka「Usually, I almost never get that calm, do I?」%K%P

0xA18
Yuka「But quietly drawing pictures like that might have been me%Nresetting my heart...」%K%P

0xA24
Resetting, huh...?%K%P

0xA30
―The image of an empty art room, save for Yuka%Ndrawing pictures in a corner.%K%P

0xA3C
I can't imagine that very well.%K%P

0xA48
It doesn't seem like something she would naturally do.%K%P

0xA54
Yuka「And so, I went to the art room on that day as well, and%Ndrew a rough sketch in my sketchbook.」%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「What did you draw?」%K%P

0xA6C
Yuka「...」%K%P

0xA78
Yuka hesitates for a moment before continuing.%K%P

0xA84
Yuka「A picture of a cuckoo clock...」%K%P

0xA90
Yuka「I'm sure I told you earlier, didn't I? That the last time I saw%Na cuckoo clock was in middle school...」%K%P

0xA9C
Makoto「And that cuckoo clock had two doves that you thought%Nwere a male and female pair.」%K%P

0xAA8
Yuka「That's right... That cuckoo clock was fixed above the%Nblackboard in the art room.」%K%P

0xAB4
Yuka「Every hour, the two doves would alternate in coming out%Nto announce the time.」%K%P

0xAC0
Yuka「At 1:00, the right dove would chirp once, and at 2:00, only%Nthe left bird would chirp twice...」%K%P

0xACC
Yuka「But at only 12:00 were both doves able to come out%Nsimultaneously and chirp together.」%K%P

0xAD8
Yuka「But don't you think that's a little too sad?」%K%P

0xAE4
Yuka「It's only twice a day... and even when they come%Ntogether, they can only meet for 24 seconds!」%K%P

0xAF0
I nod, beckoning her to continue.%K%P

0xAFC
Yuka「So you know what? I thought that even though it would%Njust be in a picture, I could at least try to grant their wish.」%K%P

0xB08
Yuka「It was a picture with the dove on the right stopping the%Nclock's hand by stretching out one of its wings with all%Nits might... the hands were pointing exactly at 12:00...」%K%P

0xB14
Yuka「The dove on the left tried to nestle close to the dove on%Nthe right, its heavy eyelids closed...」%K%P

0xB20
Yuka「It was like a fantasy-esque illustration straight out of a%Nmanga... all from that art room.」%K%P

0xB2C
I try to picture that drawing in my head as she%Ndescribes it.%K%P

0xB38
The right dove stopping time, and the left dove nestling%Nclose to it...%K%P

0xB44
Hmm... it doesn't sound right to me.%K%P

0xB50
It might be because it's a little narrow-minded.%K%P

0xB5C
I wouldn't be able to look at it without feeling a%Nheat-pounding restlessness―all I'm getting is an%Nuneasy impression.%K%P

0xB68
That clock hand pinned down by the bird's wing sounds%Nlike it'll slip free at any moment...%K%P

0xB74
In that instant, time will start moving again, won't it...?%K%P

0xB80
―However, indifferent to my thoughts, Yuka continues%Nfrom where she left off.%K%P

0xB8C
Yuka「And then, all of the sudden, a certain student I%Nrecognized came in.」%K%P

0xB98
Yuka「It was a boy...」%K%P

0xBA4
Yuka「I only knew him by face. We'd never talked, and I didn't%Neven know his name...」%K%P

0xBB0
Yuka「In the class change that day, he was the boy who sat in%Nthe seat adjacent to mine in our classroom.」%K%P

0xBBC
Yuka「...When he entered the art room, he silently paced%Naimlessly around the room.」%K%P

0xBC8
Yuka「Even though our eyes met, neither of us said a word, with%Nonly time slowly passing...」%K%P

0xBD4
Yuka「But you know what? Before long, he looked at the%Nsketchbook standing upon and open in front of me, and%Nsaid one thing... one thing only.」%K%P

0xBE0
Yuka「'This is no good.'」%K%P

0xBEC
Yuka「I automatically got offended, and when I came to my%Nsenses, I had angrily retored, 'What part of it is no%Ngood!?'」%K%P

0xBF8
Yuka「I thought at that time that he was an idiot and didn't know%Nanything.」%K%P

0xC04
Yuka「Of course, I thought I was the only one who knew about%Nthe cuckoo clock...」%K%P

0xC10
Yuka「But then, that boy countered with an unexpected%Nanswer...」%K%P

0xCA0
... ...%K%P

0xCAC
Boy「You're just being narrow-minded, aren't you?」%K%P

0xCB8
Boy「A bird's a bird because it can fly in the air. Because it%Ncan fly in the air, it's free.」%K%P

0xCC4
Boy「Let me have that!」%K%P

0xCD0
As soon as he said that, he took the pencil and eraser%Nout of my hands and began to recklessly destroy the%Nclock in the sketchbook.%K%P

0xCDC
Dumbfounded and at a loss for words, I was captivated%Nby the picture he was drawing.%K%P

0xCE8
As for the finished drawing, he had drawn the pair of%Ndoves flying away towards outside the window.%K%P

0xCF4
The wall of the art room in the picture had the clock%Ndangling at a messed-up angle, broken and with its%Nsprings protruding from it.%K%P

0xD00
Boy「If you want to stop time, then it's all right to destroy time.」%K%P

0xD0C
Boy「If you want to escape from time, it's all right to flap your%Nwings.」%K%P

0xD18
Boy「If you stay tied down, you can't be free.」%K%P

0xD24
Boy「If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid.」%K%P

0xD30
He said that, tore the picture out of the sketch book,%Nthen crumpled the picture he had just drawn into a ball%Nand threw it in the garbage can.%K%P

0xD3C
He threw it... that was all.%K%P

0xD48
After that, he never spoke another word, and left the art%Nroom, just like that.%K%P

0xD7C
The cherry blossoms outside of the open window were in%Nfull bloom...%K%P

0xD88
Sometimes, a cherry blossom pettle would flutter and go%Nastray, landing on top of a desk.%K%P

0xD94
I was so dumbstruck that I remained paralyzed in that%Nplace for a couple of hours...%K%P

0xDE0
... ...%K%P

0xE70
Yuka「That was how I fell in love...」%K%P

0xE7C
Makoto「... I see...」%K%P

0xE88
I gulp down on my saliva, and barely manage to say%Nthese words.%K%P

0xE94
For some reason, my chest is hot.%K%P

0xEA0
A gloomy lump throbs in my stomach.%K%P

0xEAC
("If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid,"...%Nsuch a pretentious line.)%K%P

0xEB8
(If it were me, I would have said something more direct...)%K%P

0xEC4
Yuka said that was when she had "fallen in love".%K%P

0xED0
Fallen in love... then does that mean even now, she's%Nstill...?%K%P

0xEDC
Makoto「Say, Yuka? Did it go well with that boy?」%K%P

0xEE8
Yuka「Huh? Mmm...」%K%P

0xEF4
Yuka hangs her head down.%K%P

0xF00
It seems like she's trying to search for the right words%Nto say.%K%P

0xF0C
Only meaningless time passes...%K%P

0xF18
Does Yuka plan on not answering at this rate?%K%P

0xF24
But...%K%P

0xF30
Yuka「No. Because my love was unrequited...」%K%P

0xF3C
... she finally answers.%K%P

0xF48
She then whispers in a small voice.%K%P

0xF54
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0xF60
Yuka「But even now, I can't forget him.」%K%P

0xF6C
―My breath is instinctively taken away.%K%P

0xF78
My body feels shocked numb, as if I had been struck by%Nlightning.%K%P

0xF84
Makoto「Well then, can't you just confess to him?」%K%P

0xF90
I say the opposite of what I'm feeling.%K%P

0xF9C
But... Yuka doesn't answer.%K%P

0xFA8
She doesn't even show signs that she'll answer.%K%P

0xFB4
Only a sad smile rises to her face as she absently%Nstares at the drifting petals...%K%P

0xFC0
Yuka「... Well then, shall we go?」%K%P

0xFCC
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0xFD8
Yuka「Sorry for telling you such a trivial story...」%K%P

0xFE4
Her tone's the same as always...%K%P

0xFF0
Is she saying there's some reason for why she doesn't%Nwant to answer?%K%P

0xFFC
Yuka「The cherry blossom... they're pretty, aren't they? ... The%Ncherry blossoms...」%K%P

0x1008
With those words, I finally understand.%K%P

0x1014
She doesn't want me to pry any further.%K%P

0x1020
So...%K%P

0x102C
Makoto「Yeah, you're right.」%K%P

0x1038
... I'll respectfully back off.%K%P

0x1044
The cherry blossom petals fall endlessly.%K%P

0x1050
The cherry blossom trees stretch out front and back,%Ncovered in flowers like a forest is with leaves.%K%P

0x105C
It's as if they might go on forever, endlessly.%K%P

0x1068
I take a deep breath, filling my chest with the scent of%Nthe cherry blossoms hanging over and around me, which%Nalmost causes my muscles to stiffen and coil up.%K%P

0x1074
Makoto「Well then, shall we go?」%K%P

0x1080
I cheerfully say this, suggesting we return now, and turn%Naround to head back.%K%P

0x108C
But...%K%P

0x1098
Yuka「He was...」%K%P

0x10A4
Yuka faces me as I turn around, and suddenly adds this.%K%P

0x10B0
Yuka「He was very similar...」%K%P

0x10DC
Yuka「To you, Makoto...」%K%P

0x1114
"He was very similar..."%K%P

0x1120
"To you, Makoto..."%K%P

0x112C
Yuka mutters this, and instead of the direction I'm trying%Nto turn towards, she starts walking towards the tip of%Nthe cape.%K%P

0x1138
I immediately follow after Yuka, a little shocked by those%Nunexpected words.%K%P

0x11B8
When we leave the cherry blossom road and arrive at%Nthe wide, picturesque scenery of Viewpoint Park, I can't%Neven wring out my voice.%K%P

0x11C4
Yuka said she can't forget her first love, even now...%K%P

0x11D0
And that that guy is similar to me...%K%P

0x11DC
My emotions and thoughts are all scrambled in a chaotic%Nmess.%K%P

0x11E8
I don't even know where to begin to sort them out.%K%P

0x11F4
"How are we similar?"%K%P

0x1200
... I keep telling myself to ask her countless times, but%Nevery time I get the opportunity, I somehow can't bring%Nmyself to do it.%K%P

0x120C
(What was her agenda in telling me those things...?)%K%P

0x1218
Right now, she's blankly gazing out at the ocean, acting%Ncalmly as if nothing happened.%K%P

0x1224
And so, for a while, we remain silent and surrender%Nourselves to the flow of time...%K%P

0x1278
Yuka「Ah...!」%K%P

0x129C
That voice brings me back.%K%P

0x12A8
I don't know if something happened, but when I look%Ntowards Yuka, her posture has been destroyed, as%Nshe's staggering forwards.%K%P

0x12B4
(... Did she trip on the pavement?)%K%P

0x12C0
Yuka almost falls over, but she grabs the handrail in%Nfront of her, putting her whole strength into it...%K%P

0x12CC
―At that time, I hear a small sound...%K%P

0x1328
Yuka「Ah...」%K%P

0x1334
Suddenly, Yuka speaks.%K%P

0x1340
Yuka「... An earthquake.」%K%P

0x134C
Makoto「An earthquake!?」%K%P

0x1358
I'm taken aback, as I had let my gaze wander aimlessly,%Nso I'm now checking for the signs of one.%K%P

0x1364
It's shaking.%K%P

0x1370
The core of my body has certainly been ensnared by%Nthe delicate shaking of the ground.%K%P

0x137C
The tourists here and there in the area also have%Nsensed this subtle, unexpected change, and nervously%Npay attention to their surroundings.%K%P

0x1388
Makoto「You're right...」%K%P

0x1394
And in the instant I mutter this!%K%P

0x13E4
―Rumble!%K%P

0x13F0
The tremors arrive together with shock waves that feel%Nlike they're pushing up.%K%P

0x13FC
These are the main tremors that come after the%Npreliminary ones...%K%P

0x1408
This is the second earthquake since we came here!%K%P

0x1414
It feels stronger than the one on the 1st.%K%P

0x1420
Can it only be felt on the tip of this cape?%K%P

0x142C
Yuka grabs the fence with both of her hands, and bends%Ndown a bit, waiting for the tremors to calm down.%K%P

0x1438
I also grasp the fence with one hand, and with both of my%Nfeet, I step firmly on the ground that's shaking like the%Nbelly of a beast.%K%P

0x1450
―In the midst of this, I hear a small sound...%K%P

0x1478
It's a certain high-pitched metallic sound I know I've%Nheard before...%K%P

0x14A0
(I-Impossible...)%K%P

0x14AC
In the twinkling of an eye, goosebumps begin to spread%Nover my whole body.%K%P

0x14C8
My shaking knees are not due to the earthquake.%K%P

0x14D4
I reflexively search for the source of the sound.%K%P

0x14E0
The ringing sound is in the direction of... Yuka's feet...%K%P

0x14EC
I squint and stare at the ground's surface.%K%P

0x14F8
―A sparkling light.%K%P

0x1504
The sharp light pierces both of my eyes.%K%P

0x1510
Makoto「That's... impossible...」%K%P

0x1540
Damp, unpleasant sweat rises to my forehead.%K%P

0x154C
The shaking in my knees still hasn't stopped.%K%P

0x1558
While I'm pinned down by the pounding of my heart,%Nbeating as loud as an alarm bell, I slowly crouch down...%K%P

0x1564
... I nervously stretch out my hand...%K%P

0x1578
"A bell..."%K%P

0x1584
It's a bell that shines a cold, silver light, and feels frozen%Nto the touch...%K%P

0x1590
It has a light crimson string...%K%P

0x159C
There's no mistaking it. It's definitely that "bell".%K%P

0x15A8
But... why is it here...?%K%P

0x15B4
Why... is it at Yuka's feet...?%K%P

0x15EC
―It's the sound of the bell I heard earlier.%K%P

0x15F8
There's no mistaking that it was the sound of the bell%Nstriking the ground.%K%P

0x1604
In other words... the bell fell.%K%P

0x1610
From where?%K%P

0x161C
I don't even have to think about that, do I!?%K%P

0x166C
Makoto「Hey, Yuka!」%K%P

0x16A0
Yuka「Hey, Makoto!」%K%P

0x16AC
Makoto「This bell...」%K%P

0x16B8
Yuka「... What's going on!?」%K%P

0x16C4
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x16D0
Yuka「Huh?」%K%P

0x16DC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x16E8
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x16F4
Makoto「Why did you have this!?」%K%P

0x1700
Yuka「Why do you have that!?」%K%P

0x170C
Our voices neatly overlap.%K%P

0x1740
Yuka「Hey!? Why do you have that!?」%K%P

0x174C
Makoto「You're wrong! I never had this!」%K%P

0x1758
Yuka「But you're holding it now, right!」%K%P

0x1764
Makoto「That's because you dropped it, and just I picked it up...」%K%P

0x1770
Yuka「Me!? ... I didn't drop it!」%K%P

0x1784
... What's the meaning of this?%K%P

0x1790
It doesn't feel like our conversation's smoothly in gear...%K%P

0x179C
(Furthermore...)%K%P

0x17A8
(Furthermore... why does Yuka know about this bell!?)%K%P

0x17B4
...%K%P

0x17C0
... We wait for the other to continue this unproductive%Nconversation.%K%P

0x17CC
Suddenly, before we can speak, a little girl totters over%Nto us.%K%P

0x17D8
She seems to be about five or six... well, anyway, she%Nfeels like a girl who's only just started elementary%Nschool.%K%P

0x17E4
When that little girl stands slightly in front of us, she%Nsays a mere three words.%K%P

0x17F0
Girl「Give it back!」%K%P

0x17FC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1808
Yuka「...」%K%P

0x1814
Yuka and I instinctively exchange glances.%K%P

0x1820
Girl「Give it back!!」%K%P

0x182C
The girl sticks out her palm again and again.%K%P

0x1838
Makoto「'Give it back'... give... what back?」%K%P

0x1844
Girl「That!」%K%P

0x1850
The girl points her short white index finger at my closed%Nfist.%K%P

0x1884
Yuka「Huh? ... By 'that', do you mean... this?」%K%P

0x1890
Yuka grabs my wrist with a jerk and gives me a glare that%NI know is demanding me to open my fist.%K%P

0x189C
I calmly obey her.%K%P

0x18A8
Obviously, in my palm is that "bell".%K%P

0x18B4
Just then...%K%P

0x18C0
... the girl suddenly snatches the bell from my palm.%K%P

0x18CC
I wouldn't have guessed it since she's so young, but the%Ngirl is as fast as lightning...%K%P

0x18D8
Girl「Thanks♪」%K%P

0x18E4
Before she even finishes thanking us, the girl turns%Naround and gets ready to run.%K%P

0x1918
Yuka「Ah! Wait a minute!」%K%P

0x192C
Yuka springs like a bullet and cuts around in front of the%Ngirl.%K%P

0x1938
The girl stops...%K%P

0x1944
Yuka bends over until she's at eye level with the girl.%K%P

0x1978
Yuka「Um... Hey, there's something I'd like to ask you...」%K%P

0x1984
Girl「???」%K%P

0x1990
Yuka「What happened to that bell? Would you tell me?」%K%P

0x199C
Girl「I tied it up to that pole over there.」%K%P

0x19A8
Girl「That way, if it fell, I wouldn't lose it.」%K%P

0x19B4
Girl「So... So it's mine!」%K%P

0x19C0
I see, so that's how it is...%K%P

0x19DC
The bell's string was tied to the fence, but because of%NYuka, it fell to the ground...%K%P

0x19F0
The bell's string was tied to the fence, but because of%Nthe earthquake, it fell to the ground...%K%P

0x19FC
It may have been because I was thinking about other%Nthings, but I hadn't noticed the bell when it was tied there%Nat all...%K%P

0x1A30
Yuka「No. That's not what I meant...」%K%P

0x1A3C
Yuka shakes her head, and gives the girl a sweet smile.%K%P

0x1A48
Yuka「I mean why do you have that bell in the first place...?」%K%P

0x1A54
Girl「??」%K%P

0x1A60
Yuka「Did someone give it to you?」%K%P

0x1A6C
Girl「???」%K%P

0x1A78
Yuka「Or did you pick it up somewhere?」%K%P

0x1A84
Girl「Yeah, that's right... I picked it up last night.」%K%P

0x1AB8
Yuka「D-Do you remember where you picked it up?」%K%P

0x1AC4
Girl「Yeah, I do.」%K%P

0x1AD0
Yuka「Where?」%K%P

0x1AE4
Girl「Umm...」%K%P

0x1AF0
Girl「... The moon!」%K%P

0x1AFC
Girl「I picked it up on that sandy beach shaped like a%Ncrescent moon!」%K%P

0x1B08
―Moon Beach!!%K%P

0x1B14
I am astonished...%K%P

0x1B20
I even feel lightheaded and dizzy.%K%P

0x1B2C
(How could this be...?)%K%P

0x1B38
The bell I threw into the ocean on the night of the 1st%Nwashed back up on shore through the waves!%K%P

0x1B44
(Maybe if I'd thrown it farther...)%K%P

0x1B50
―No, that's wrong!%K%P

0x1B5C
(Maybe if I'd smashed it with a rock or something...)%K%P

0x1B68
―That's not it!%K%P

0x1B74
That's not it!%K%P

0x1B80
I picked up the bell because I was fated to.%K%P

0x1B8C
It will continue to follow me everywhere until that time%Ncomes.%K%P

0x1B98
I can feel an unbelievably overwhelming "power".%K%P

0x1BA4
I suddenly feel as if it's tugging the back of my neck,%Ntrying to drag me to a far-away world... it's that kind of%Nfeeling.%K%P

0x1BB0
... There's nothing I can do... I can't even scream...%K%P

0x1BBC
But...%K%P

0x1BC8
While that may be true, it's impossible for me to just%Nstand still, right?!%K%P

0x1BD4
Even if... it seems to be a useless struggle!%K

0x2F2C
Take the bell from the girl by force.

0x2F38
Persuade the girl to give the bell back.

0x1C14
When I run over to the girl, I wrap my palm around her small%Nfist.%K%P

0x1C20
Makoto「Listen carefully!」%K%P

0x1C2C
Makoto「This bell is a very dangerous thing!」%K%P

0x1C38
Makoto「If you have it, incredibly terrible things may happen to%Nyou!」%K%P

0x1C44
Makoto「So... give that bell to...!」%K%P

0x1C50
Girl「Um, sir... are you a weirdo?」%K%P

0x1C5C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x1C68
Girl「You're a weirdo too, aren't you, ma'am?」%K%P

0x1C74
The girl looks back and forth between Yuka and I%Nrestlessly.%K%P

0x1C80
And then, all of the sudden, she lets out a loud, shrill%Nscream.%K%P

0x1C8C
Girl「MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0x1C98
Surprised, I come to my senses.%K%P

0x1CA4
The girl waves my hand off of her, and runs over to the%Nentrance of the park with noisy, faltering steps.%K%P

0x1CB8
When I run over to the girl, I bend over just like Yuka.%K%P

0x1CC4
Makoto「U-Um? Will you listen carefully to what I have to say?」%K%P

0x1CD0
Girl「??」%K%P

0x1CDC
Makoto「The truth is, that bell is a very scary thing!」%K%P

0x1CE8
Makoto「There is a ghost sealed into it that comes out in the%Nmiddle of the night.」%K%P

0x1CF4
Girl「??」%K%P

0x1D00
Makoto「And then it drains the souls of all the humans in the area%Nand gobbles on them!」%K%P

0x1D0C
Girl「...」%K%P

0x1D18
Makoto「S-So, give that bell to me for safe keeping...」%K%P

0x1D24
Girl「Um, sir... are you a weirdo?」%K%P

0x1D30
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x1D3C
Girl「You're a weirdo too, aren't you, ma'am?」%K%P

0x1D48
The girl looks back and forth between Yuka and I%Nrestlessly.%K%P

0x1D54
Her eyes are just overflowing with tears... she's%Ncompletely frightened.%K%P

0x1D60
Makoto「Y-You're wrong. That's not it at―」%K%P

0x1D6C
Girl「PAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!」%K%P

0x1D78
―Suddenly, my ears are shattered by the girl's loud,%Nshrill scream.%K%P

0x1D84
I wince at this unexpected development.%K%P

0x1D90
It's not that I didn't know how I should have coped with it,%Nit's that I was just so frantic that I wasn't thinking clearly.%K%P

0x1D9C
While this is happening, the girl slips out between Yuka%Nand I, and with faltering steps, runs towards the%Nentrance of the park.%K%P

0x1DA8
A married couple looks at us with a suspicious glance.%K%P

0x1DB4
Naturally, we can't chase them.%K%P

0x1DC0
Right now... that bell... is still being held by that girl...%K%P

0x1DCC
(What should I do...?)%K%P

0x1DD8
(First, what should I think to do...?)%K%P

0x1DE4
I don't even know that, leaving me bewildered.%K%P

0x1E00
... I glance over towards Yuka.%K%P

0x1E0C
For some reason, Yuka's eyes are muddy and glazed.%K%P

0x1E18
Her artificial smile twitches, and her cheeks turn pale.%K%P

0x1E4C
Yuka「Moon... Beach...」%K%P

0x1E60
Yuka mutters this to herself...%K%P

0x1E6C
Makoto「Moon Beach!?」%K%P

0x1EA0
Yuka「Ah... no... it's nothing, nothing.」%K%P

0x1EAC
Makoto「How can you say it's nothing? Your face is completely%Npale!」%K%P

0x1EE0
Yuka「It's really... nothing...」%K%P

0x1EEC
Yuka looks downwards, avoiding eye contact.%K%P

0x1EF8
Makoto「... Say, Yuka? There's something I want to ask you.」%K%P

0x1F04
Yuka「Huh? ... Mmm...」%K%P

0x1F10
Makoto「It's very important.」%K%P

0x1F1C
Yuka「R-Right... Maybe next time?」%K%P

0x1F28
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0x1F5C
Yuka「There's... something... I have to do no matter what right%Nnow!」%K%P

0x1F68
Yuka「No. It's not really that big of a deal, but...」%K%P

0x1F74
Yuka「So I've... I've got to go.」%K%P

0x1F80
Makoto「Hey! Wait a minute, Yuka!」%K%P

0x1FA4
Yuka「Well then, go on back ahead of me...」%K%P

0x1FC0
Yuka「Well then, see you later...」%K%P

0x1FCC
Yuka「5:00 at Lunabeach... don't forget, okay?」%K%P

0x1FE0
Leaving with those words, Yuka runs away.%K%P

0x1FEC
She shoots me a glance that shuts down any thoughts I%Nhad of chasing her.%K%P

0x1FF8
Yuka's hiding something―that's for certain.%K%P

0x2004
But I have the feeling that asking her anything right now%Nwould be useless...%K%P

0x2010
All I can do at the moment is wait.%K%P

0x201C
Just a little bit, until she's calm again...%K%P

0x20A0
I close my eyes and let the sea breeze blow by me.%K%N%N

0x20AC
I need to still the confusion in my mind...%K%N%N

0x20B8
I can't hear the wind.%K%N

0x20C4
The only sound I can hear is that of my own excessively%Nloud breathing.%K%N

0x20D0
It feels like I've crawled under the bottom of the deep%Nocean...%K%P

0x20E4
... In this loneliness, my thoughts return to where I had left%Noff before.%K%N%N

0x20F0
About Yuka... and the bell...%K%P

0x20FC
Though Yuka spoke to that girl kindly, she was pressing%Nher persistently about the bell.%K%N

0x2108
And even earlier than that... Yuka said this when she saw%Nthe bell I picked up.%K%N%N

0x2114
「"Why do you have that!?」%K%N%N

0x2120
In other words, Yuka recognized it... that "bell"...%K%P

0x2134
―Why?%K%N

0x2140
―Why does Yuka know about that "bell"!?%K%N%N

0x214C
But the truth... is in a deep darkness...%K%N

0x2158
It'll remain there until I can get the truth from Yuka's own%Nlips...%K%N

0x2164
...%K%P

0x2178
And there's one more, much more important problem%Nthat's coiling around my head.%K%N

0x2184
―The fact that that "bell" has appeared before me%Nonce again.%K%N

0x2190
There's no mistake that it's the "bell" from my dream.%K%N

0x219C
If that's the case... If that's the case... then is that%Ndream...?%K%P

0x21B0
No, there's no way that could be possible, right!?%K%N

0x21BC
What the hell am I saying...?%K%N

0x21C8
Something like this is nothing more than a simple%Ncoincidence.%K%N%N

0x21D4
("A simple coincidence!?"―That old excuse again?)%K%N

0x21E0
(Can all these strange incidents over the past few days%Nbe explained by those three simple words?)%K%P

0x21F4
I don't know... I have absolutely no clue what's what.%K%N

0x2200
I can't find one thing that I can declare I have%Nconfidence in.%K%N

0x220C
No matter how many times I surrender myself to the sea%Nbreeze, I can't solve the confusion in my mind.%K%N

0x2218
Rather, the chaos gets excessively and complexly%Nentangled in proportion to the time passing, to the point%Nwhere now, I can't even find the origin of all of it.%K%P

0x222C
... I feel like I'm at the bottom of the sea.%K%N

0x2238
If I look in a random direction, can I crawl up?%K%N

0x2244
If this is the bottom of the ocean where no light reaches,%Nthen even the distinction between heaven and earth%Ndoesn't reach here.%K%N

0x2250
My head is throbbing with pain, and my stomach is%Nturning inside out.%K%N%N

0x225C
(Then... what should I do?)%K%P

0x2270
Rather, what's the first thing I should do?%K%N

0x227C
All I can do is untie the tangled threads until I can catch%Nhold of that clue.%K%N

0x2288
―The "bell"... I have to find that "bell".%K%N

0x2294
I can worry about Yuka later.%K%P

0x22A8
Anyway, for now, my first priority is finding the little girl%Nwho has the bell.%K%N

0x22B4
"The anxiety that comes from doing nothing is worse%Nthan any danger you might face," as they say.%K%N

0x22C0
With my mind made up, I calmly open my eyes...%K%P

0x2350
This was the first place I could think of... Tsukiya Hotel.%K%P

0x235C
Judging from her appearance, that girl is definitely a%Ntourist on a family vacation.%K%P

0x2368
(If that's the case, then they must be staying at this%Nhotel...)%K%P

0x2374
I approach the hotel's automatic doors.%K%P

0x2380
Before I can reach them, they suddenly open up.%K%P

0x238C
And the one who comes outside is...%K%P

0x2398
―that girl!!%K%P

0x23CC
I've looked high and low for that girl for several hours,%Nbut in the end, I couldn't find her...%K%P

0x23D8
I've ended up arriving here, at this pier...%K%P

0x23E4
There's only half an hour left until I'm supposed to be at%NLunabeach.%K%P

0x23F0
(Is... all I can do just give up for today...?)%K%P

0x23FC
Dropping my shoulders, I turn around.%K%P

0x2408
Just then... Right in front of the fish market, playing with a%Npushcart...%K%P

0x2414
―is that girl!!%K%P

0x2420
I start fiercely running over towards the fish market...%K%P

0x2458
I rush to go talk to her.%K%P

0x2480
Makoto「A-About that bell...」%K%P

0x248C
Girl「Oh... you're that...」%K%P

0x2498
Makoto「Listen, I want that bell back, no matter...」%K%P

0x24A4
Girl「I gave it away♪」%K%P

0x24B0
Makoto「Gave it away? Gave it away... to who?」%K%P

0x24BC
Girl「Hey, look, look, isn't it cute?」%K%P

0x24C8
The girl ignores my question, and slowly pulls something%Nout of her pocket.%K%P

0x24DC
On top of her small palm... is a keychain that I recognize.%K%P

0x24E8
Attached to the keychain is that fat cat mascot%Ncharacter.%K%P

0x24F4
―It's Yuka's!%K%P

0x2500
There's no doubt about it, this is the keychain Yuka said%Nshe bought from the souvenir shop!%K%P

0x2534
Girl「We traded them♪」%K%P

0x2540
Makoto「... You traded with Yuka!?」%K%P

0x254C
Girl「Yuka???」%K%P

0x2558
Girl「Is Yuka the name of this cat?」%K%P

0x2564
Makoto「That's not it... did the girl who was with me at Viewpoint%NPark give this to you?」%K%P

0x2570
Girl「Yeah, that's right. That lady traded it with me.」%K%P

0x257C
(I knew it...)%K%P

0x2588
Makoto「I see... Thanks for telling me.」%K%P

0x2594
I pat the girl on the head, and start running.%K%P

0x25A0
However...%K%P

0x25AC
Makoto「Oh, that's right!」%K%P

0x25B8
... I suddenly realize something. I turn around, and tell her%Nthis.%K%P

0x25C4
Makoto「It seems that cat's name is 'Nin-Nin Neko Pyon'.」%K%P

0x25D0
Makoto「Isn't it cute?」%K%P

0x25DC
Girl「???」%K%P

0x2608
As I leave, I hear a voice coming from the hotel lobby.%K%P

0x2614
Announcer「Hey! I told you not to go outside on your own, right?!」%K%P

0x2620
Announcer「... Yue-chan!」%K%P

0x2674
Right now, I am turning face up on the bed, staring%Nblankly at the ceiling.%K%P

0x2680
Of course, when I returned to the lodge, I immediately%Nlooked for Yuka.%K%P

0x268C
But Haruka told me she went to the hot springs, so I%Nstopped there and decided to wait in my room on%Nstandby.%K%P

0x2698
As I look at the ceiling, I think of the bell.%K%P

I think about it, but I can't think of any sort of answer...%K%P

0x26B0
...%K%P

0x26BC
I realize that I'm both physically and mentally exhausted.%K%P

0x26C8
Against my will, I am suddenly dragged into an intense%Ndrowsiness that's consuming me.%K%P

0x26D4
(No... I can't fall asleep... now...)%K%P

0x26E0
(... I've got to ask Yuka... about the bell... I've got to... ask...%Nher...)%K%P

0x26EC
Despite my efforts, I lose consciousness in the blink of%Nan eye...%K%P

0x2700
As I leave, I hear a voice from the market.%K%P

0x270C
Announcer「Come on, we're done buying souvenirs, so let's go!」%K%P

0x2718
Announcer「... Yue-chan!」%K%P

0x2768
*Tap, tap, tap, tap*...%K%P

0x2774
I quickly arrive at Lunabeach...%K%P

0x2780
I forcefully thrust the door open.%K%P

0x27EC
Makoto「Sorry I'm late!」%K%P

0x2828
Yuka「You're late! You're twelve minutes late!」%K%P

0x2834
Yuka「As promised, you must pay a fine of 1200 yen.」%K%P

0x2840
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x284C
I'm at a loss for words.%K%P

0x2858
It's not because she's demanding that I fulfill a promise%Nthat I clearly never made... it's not like that.%K%P

0x2864
―Yuka's back to her normal self.%K%P

0x2870
That has left me dumbfounded.%K%P

0x2894
Yuka「That's what I want to say, but because I'm forgiving%Ntoday, I'll lighten it to 'baggage carrier'!」%K%P

0x28A0
Makoto「Yuka...?」%K%P

0x28AC
Yuka「?」%K%P

0x28B8
I've failed to ask her... I thought about questioning her%Nabout the "bell", but...%K%P

0x28C4
... Everyone else has already gathered inside the shop.%K%P

0x28D0
I can't ask her now.%K%P

0x28DC
All I can do is wait afterwards for a time when we're all%Nalone.%K%P

0x28F0
Yuka「Whaaat? Do you have any complaints?」%K%P

0x28FC
Makoto「N-No...」%K%P

0x2908
Makoto「Nothing... in particular.」%K%P

0x291C
Yuka「All right! Then it's settled! Shall we start preparing at%Nonce?」%K%P

0x296C
A barbecue set and the charcoal... they made me carry%Nall the heavy stuff.%K%P

0x2978
The others are walking in front, each one carrying a%Ndifferent set of ingredients.%K%P

0x2984
(Anyway, why does Yuka know about the bell?)%K%P

0x2990
(Why did she take the bell from that girl?)%K%P

0x299C
Suddenly, I hear Yuka's shrill laughter from ahead of me.%K%P

0x29A8
Right now, Yuka definitely has the bell.%K%P

0x29B4
Why is Yuka in such a good mood right now?%K%P

0x29C0
I can't understand why, but anyway, the atmosphere%Naround Yuka makes it feel like nothing bad happened.%K%P

0x29CC
(Was it really just a coincidence after all?)%K%P

0x29D8
(Am I just thinking too much into this?)%K%P

0x29E4
Yeah.. it's gotta be that!%K%P

0x29F0
Everyone in front of me is having fun...%K%P

0x29FC
Perhaps it's because I've been influenced by that%Npleasant sight, but before I know it, my mind has%Nregained its calm.%K%P

0x2A08
... The sun slowly begins to sink behind the ridges of the%Nwestern mountains.%K%P

0x2A14
Because I didn't have lunch, I feel famished.%K%P

0x2A20
I'm really looking forward to this barbecue...%K%P
