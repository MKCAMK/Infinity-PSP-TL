I return to my room, and think about Haruka.%K%P

0x70
Yuka's words are bothering me.%K%N

0x7C
Haruka's under the impression that she's a special%Nbeing?%K%N

0x88
That's ridiculous!%K%P

0xB0
At that time, I hear someone knock on the door.%K%P

0xD8
When I let out a flat "it's open", Izumi-san opens the door.%K%P

0x120
Izumi「Can I come in?」%K%P

0x12C
Makoto「Yeah, go ahead... What is it?」%K%P

0x138
Izumi「I heard the story from Yuka-chan about Haruka...」%K%P

0x154
Makoto「Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore... We were just a little%Nshocked to hear the truth about Haruka... No, I think that%NHaruka is Haruka.」%K%P

0x160
Izumi「Do you want to think that there's no difference between%Nhumans and clones?」%K%P

0x16C
Makoto「Do you think there's a difference?」%K%P

0x178
Izumi「No, but there was a time where people clearly thought%Ndifferently.」%K%P

0x184
Makoto「No, but...!」%K%P

0x190
Izumi「Makoto-kun, do you know what the trigger was that made%Nclone fertilization legal?」%K%P

0x19C
Makoto「No...」%K%P

0x1A8
Izumi「Even though the Clone Control Law was still in effect, a%Nscientist made a clone of his son, who died in an%Naccident. He just wanted to see his son again, no matter%Nthe cost...」%K%P

0x1B4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1C0
Izumi「But when his secret leaked out, he was put on trial. He%Nwas sentenced to life imprisonment. That much was%Nconsidered to be an extremely serious crime...」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「No way...」%K%P

0x1D8
Izumi「However, when the contents of the cloned boy's%Ntestimony was reported, there was a complete turnover%Nof public opinion, which grew powerful enough to lead to%Nthe amendment of the law.」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「What did that cloned boy say?」%K%P

0x1F0
Izumi「'Papa didn't do anything wrong. I'm so grateful to Papa.%NBecause Papa is the one who gave me this life...'」%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「That was nine years ago... Izumi-san, you remember this%Nquite well.」%K%P

0x208
Izumi「My father is currently the authority on genetic%Nengineering. I'm... I'm just repeating what he told me.」%K%P

0x234
(Her father is the authority on genetic engineering...?)%K%P

0x240
... Morino...%K%N

0x24C
... Morino...%K%N

0x258
... Morino... no way...%K%P

0x264
Izumi-san's father is...%K%N

0x270
—Dr. Shigezo Morino!?%K%P

0x27C
If I'm not mistaken, several decades ago, Dr. Morino%Nparticipated in the Human Genome Project, and was the%None who discovered the ground breaking analysis for%Nthe DNA sequence, right?%K%P

0x288
I guess it's a small world after all... wait, I have no time to%Nthink about that! I need to get back on topic...%K%P

0x294
Makoto「But aren't we past that era already? It's all in the past,%Nisn't it? They've been freed. Human or clone, there's%Nnothing we need to worry about anymore.」%K%P

0x2A0
Izumi「That... might not quite be right.」%K%P

0x2AC
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x2B8
Izumi「My friend was also a clone. Her name was Yumemi-chan,%Nbut I called her Yume-chan... When she confessed the%Ntruth to me, she was quite solemn...」%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「Makes sense.」%K%P

0x2D0
Izumi「That's why I told Yume-chan not to worry about it, that%NYume-chan was Yume-chan. That's really what I thought.%NWhen I did that, Yume-chan's face grew a little sad.」%K%P

0x2DC
Makoto「Why?」%K%P

0x2E8
Izumi「Now, I think it's probably... because Yume-chan felt like%Nshe had lost herself somehow.」%K%P

0x2F4
Makoto「I don't get it...」%K%P

0x300
Izumi「Because she'd given up. The law said it was all right, but%Npeople's feelings don't change that simply...」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「Then would it have been better to give her special%Ntreatment?」%K%P

0x318
Izumi「I don't think it was like that, but... Hmm, maybe I should%Nhave done so?」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「Even if you ask me...」%K%P

0x330
Izumi「Right... But to Yume-chan, as clone, being told that it%Ndidn't matter may have been an even bigger shock.」%K%P

0x344
I'm at a loss for words. Once again, Haruka appears in my%Nmind.%K%P

0x350
So back then, did Haruka lie when she said she was%Nhappy?%K%P
