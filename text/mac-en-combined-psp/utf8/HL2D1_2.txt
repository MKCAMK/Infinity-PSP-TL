I brush past the perplexed Yuka and head into the living%Nroom with an uneasy suspicion.%K%P

0x4C
I think I ought to confirm the facts...%K%P

0x58
The living room is empty...%K%P

0x80
Before long, the door slowly opens.%K%N

0xBC
A girl passes by me without stopping.%K%N

0xC8
I can only silently stare at her as she walks away, her%Nback faced to me.%K%P

0xEC
(Is this... actually reality...?)%K%P

0xF8
(Perhaps I'm still dreaming...?)%K%P

0x104
I stare at the girl's back, my breath having been taken%Naway.%K%P

0x110
... It's Haruka.%K%P

0x11C
Haruka...%K%N

0x128
Right now, Haruka is here, right in front of me.%K%N

0x134
She's warm and breathing— Haruka, who shouldn't be%Nalive, is a short distance away!%K%P

0x140
My heart is filled to the brim with a surge of happiness.%K%N

0x14C
Heat spreads throughout my body as my heart dances%Nwildly.%K%P

0x158
Wrapped up in an entrancing sense of ecstasy, I%Nstagger to my feet and head over towards Haruka...%K%P

0x1A8
I stand next to Haruka, who's in front of the kitchen sink,%Nand blankly stare at her.%K%P

0x1D0
Without a word, she turns the sink faucet, filling her glass%Ncup with water. With a tiny sound, she drinks the entire%Ncup in one large gulp.%K%P

0x1E8
Makoto「Haruka... you're... alive...」%K%P

0x1F4
These words instinctively come out of my mouth...%K%P

0x200
Haruka「'Alive'?」%K%P

0x21C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x228
I clam up.%K%N

0x234
I don't know how I should answer her.%K%P

0x240
My mind is still in chaos.%K%N

0x24C
I'm unable to fully grasp the reality before me.%K%P

0x258
"'Alive?'" —Haruka doesn't bother to turn towards me%Nas she asks this.%K%P

0x264
Instead, she blankly stares at the dripping faucet.%K%P

0x270
This is exactly the same as that scene from that day%Nthat's been deeply carved into my memories.%K%P

0x27C
Makoto「Haruka... Haruka...」%K%P

0x288
I don't know what I want to tell her.%K%N

0x294
All I want is to say her name...%K%P

0x2A0
Haruka「It's meaningless.」%K%P

0x2AC
Haruka says this quite suddenly.%K%P

0x2B8
Haruka「I have nothing to gain from that.」%K%P

0x2C4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2D0
Haruka「Because I...」%K%P

0x2DC
Haruka「Because I... am nothing...」%K%P

0x2E8
Such painful words.%K%N

0x2F4
It feels like everything we've worked towards has%Ncrumbled up into dust...%K%P

0x300
Haruka has lost sight of it once again...%K%N

0x30C
Her "heart"...%K%P

0x344
Haruka slips right by me and returns to the living room.%K%P

0x350
I go after her while sorting things out in my head.%K%P

0x394
... It's at that point that "he" shows up, entering the living%Nroom while rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.%K%P

0x3DC
Okuhiko「Hey!」%K%P

0x3E8
He says that in such a gaudy voice that it causes me to%Nshiver repulsively.%K%P

0x40C
Okuhiko「Huh? I'm not... interrupting something, am I?」%K%P

0x418
He asks Haruka this as he ignores my presence.%K%P

0x42C
Okuhiko「... Nah, there's no way it's like that. Ha ha ha!」%K%P

0x440
While laughing, he glares at me again. His eyes are filled%Nwith scorn...%K%P

0x454
(It's the same...)%K%P

0x460
(Everything's exactly the same!)%K%P

0x46C
(Which means that today really is the 1st...)%K%P

0x478
(No, wait. It's too early to be jumping to conclusions,%Nright?)%K%P

0x484
(... All right. I'll try to confirm if today really is the 1st...)%K%P

0x490
Anyway, Haruka's alive...%K%N

0x49C
Reaffirming that fact allows me to calm down a bit.%K%P

0x618
I decide to try my best to let this day go by as I%Nremember it.%K%N%N

0x624
Yuka's terrible breakfast. My conversation with Kurumi,%Nwho accidentally delivered the pizza to us instead of%NSaki.%K%N

0x630
After that, we leave to go play tennis...%K%P

0x6B8
If I remember correctly, this is when Okuhiko goes with%NHaruka to see the ocean.%K%N

0x6C4
I stayed here with Yuka to play tennis, but...%K%P

0x6D0
(... Why don't I try to change things up this time?)%K%P

0x6DC
Makoto「I also want to go with Haruka to the ocean...」%K%P

0x740
Yuka「Huuh? Even you're saying that... Geez, what am I%Nsupposed to do by myself!?」%K%P

0x74C
When she says that, Yuka begins to wildly swing the%Nracket in her hand around.%K%N

0x758
She looks quite offended.%K%P

0x764
Makoto「Look out!」%K%P

0x770
By the time I shout this, it's already too late.%K%P

0x7BC
A thick sound rings out...%K%P

0x7C8
Okuhiko「☆○◎×...!」%K%P

0x7DC
Yuka「Ah...」%K%P

0x7E8
Yuka's racket smashes into the back of Okuhiko's head.%K%P

0x818
Okuhiko collapses to the ground in a daze.%K%P

0x82C
Panicking, Yuka crouches down and shakes his body...%NHe's been knocked out.%K%P

0x840
Yuka「Wh-What should I do...」%K%P

0x84C
Yuka desperately turn towards me for aid.%K%P

0x858
But you know, there's probably no need to worry about%NOkuhiko.%K%N

0x864
He's not that fragile of a guy.%K%P

0x870
More importantly...%K%P

0x87C
Makoto「... Huh? ... Where's Haruka?」%K%P

0x8A4
... I've lost sight of her. I wildly look around my%Nsurroundings... Found her. She's left the tennis court and%Nis briskly walking down the forest path.%K%P

0x8B0
Makoto「Sorry Yuka, but I'll leave this to you.」%K%P

0x8BC
Yuka「Wha... don't just go acting rashly!」%K%P

0x8C8
Makoto「I'm going to go STOP her from acting rashly!」%K%P

0x8F0
I shout this over my shoulder before chasing after%NHaruka. She begins to disappear as she goes around%Nthe street's corner...%K%P

0x954
... Just like the last April 1st, I follow after Haruka.%K%P

0x9C0
Haruka is on top of the wrecked ship washed up on the%Nshore.%K%P

0xA08
It's just like back then. She's sitting on the bow of the%Nship, firmly staring at the ocean. Her soft hair sways in%Nthe sea breeze.%K%P

0xA1C
She suddenly looks my way. Our eyes meet.%K%P

0xA38
Haruka「... Why?」%K%P

0xA44
Haruka mutters this.%K%P

0xA50
Haruka「Why are you here?」%K%P

0xA5C
Makoto「I... followed you here.」%K%P

0xA68
Haruka「Why?」%K%P

0xA74
Makoto「... Because I was worried about you.」%K%P

0xA80
Haruka「You don't really need to worry about me...」%K%P

0xA8C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xA98
Haruka「Because I'm different...」%K%P

0xAA4
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0xAB0
Haruka「Because I'm different, it's fine...」%K%P

0xABC
Makoto「Haruka...%K don't say that...%K If you stay like this, then in five%Ndays...」%K%P

0xAC8
At that time...%K%P

0xAD4
Yuka「Makoto! Haruka! Where are you...!?」%K%P

0xAE0
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan...!」%K%P

0xAEC
... I hear Yuka and Okuhiko's voices in the distance.%K%P

0xAF8
I turn around to find small human figures walking down the%Ncoastline road.%K%P

0xB04
Haruka also seems to have noticed them.%K%N

0xB10
She quickly hides in the shade of the ship...%K%P

0xB24
I follow her lead and hide behind the boat.%K%P

0xB5C
... ... ...%K%P

0xB68
Several minutes later... Yuka and Okuhiko's voices%Ndisappear.%K%P

0xB7C
Haruka「It seems they've gone.」%K%P

0xB88
Haruka places her hand on my shoulder.%K%P

0xB9C
When I nod, she steps out from her hiding place, and%Nstarts walking towards the beach.%K%P

0xBD4
As she walks on the sand, she takes off her shoes and%Nsocks.%K%P

0xBE0
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0xBF4
Haruka「What?」%K%P

0xC00
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xC0C
Haruka「Did you think I was going to strip naked?」%K%P

0xC18
Makoto「N-No...」%K%P

0xC50
Haruka nonchalantly soaks her bare feet into the%Nocean. Her eyes are fixed on the faraway horizon.%K%P

0xC5C
Makoto「... I just have something I want to say...」%K%P

0xC68
Haruka「?」%K%P

0xC74
Makoto「The words you said earlier... sounded kinda lonely...」%K%P

0xC80
Haruka「Lonely? What is?」%K%P

0xC8C
Makoto「'Because I'm different'. ... You said that earlier, didn't you?」%K%P

0xC98
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xCA4
Makoto「And this morning, you also said this. 'Because I am%Nnothing'...」%K%P

0xCB0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xCBC
Makoto「'I have no heart'... that's the way you think, right?」%K%P

0xCC8
I say this.%K%N

0xCD4
Taken aback, Haruka turns to face me.%K%N

0xCE0
A distinctly disturbed expression rises to her face.%K%P

0xCEC
Haruka「That's right... I have no...」%K%P

0xCF8
Haruka hesitates midspeech.%K%P

0xD04
Haruka「How?」%K%P

0xD10
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0xD1C
Haruka「How did you...?」%K%P

0xD28
Makoto「I knew. I know a lot about you...」%K%P

0xD34
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xD50
Haruka firmly stares at me.%K%P

0xD90
I spontaneously embrace Haruka. I wrap my arms tightly%Naround her, holding her close...%K%P

0xD9C
Haruka「... That hurts.」%K%P

0xDA8
I frantically loosen my embrace at those words.%K%P

0xDBC
Makoto「S-Sorry... I was just so...」%K%P

0xDC8
Haruka「'So'... What's the rest?」%K%P

0xDD4
Makoto「... happy. So happy... that I got to see you again.」%K%P

0xDE0
Haruka「What do you mean?」%K%P

0xDEC
Makoto「No... I doubt you'd believe me even if I told you...」%K%P

0xDF8
Makoto「The reason doesn't matter. Anyway, it's because I'm%Nhappy...」%K%P

0xE04
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xE2C
Haruka's stare almost feels like it hurts.%K%N

0xE38
Her eyes are filled with curiosity.%K%N

0xE44
Complex feelings of bafflement mixed with expectation%Nappear in those eyes.%K%P

0xE50
And then, Haruka suddenly speaks.%K%P

0xE5C
Haruka「Have you ever kissed someone?」%K%P

0xE68
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xE74
Haruka「Have you?」%K%P

0xE80
(What's going on!? This is definitely... definitely...)%K%P

0xE8C
I become flustered from Haruka's unexpected question.%K%P

0xE98
The answer that comes out of my mouth is...%K

0x1A28
"Of course."

0x1A34
"O-Once..."

0xEE0
Makoto「Of course.」%K%P

0xEF4
Makoto「O-Once...」%K%P

0xF00
... That's my answer.%K%N

0xF0C
I certainly did kiss her on the forehead back then.%K%N

0xF18
On that afternoon... on the day Haruka and I went fishing%Ntogether...%K%P

0xF24
Makoto「But you know, you shouldn't really ask something like%Nthat.」%K%P

0xF30
Haruka「Is... that right?」%K%P

0xF3C
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0xF48
Haruka「Then why do people kiss?」%K%P

0xF54
Makoto「It's to demonstrate their love and confirm their feelings%Nfor each other.」%K%P

0xF60
Haruka「Confirm...?」%K%P

0xF6C
Makoto「That's right...」%K%P

0xF78
Haruka「Then... let's kiss.」%K%P

0xF84
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xF90
Haruka「Let's kiss.」%K%P

0xFC8
Haruka draws her face close to mine. Her expression%Nbegins to overwhelm my senses.%K%P

0xFD4
For some reason, the event that was supposed to%Nhappen in two days is starting now...%K%P

0xFE0
Makoto「B-But... I can't kiss you for a reason like that.」%K%P

0xFEC
I repeat the same words as last time.%K%P

0xFF8
Haruka「Then does that mean you don't feel any affection for me,%NMakoto...?」%K%P

0x1004
Makoto「No! That's not it!」%K%P

0x1010
I vigorously declare this.%K%N

0x101C
The feelings of affection I have towards Haruka now are%Nso much greater than they were at our last kiss that%Nthere's no way to compare the difference between them.%K%P

0x1028
Haruka「... Well then...」%K%P

0x1044
Makoto「All right, I understand. Well then, close your eyes.」%K%P

0x1058
Haruka quietly shuts her eyes.%K%P

0x1064
I stare at her face.%K Haruka's cheeks quiver like jelly from%Nnervousness.%K Her beckoning small lips glisten.%K%P

0x1070
I gently kiss Haruka on the forehead.%K It was just a peck%Nand lasted for only an moment.%K%P

0x107C
For some reason, I feel embarrassed, and quickly draw%Nback.%K%P

0x1090
Haruka's eyes snap open as she stares at me.%K%P

0x10C0
Haruka「This is...?」%K%P

0x10CC
When I return Haruka's gaze, a faint blush appears on%Nher cheeks.%K%P

0x10D8
I am completely captivated by her eyes.%K%P

0x1100
The cold waves loudly splash against our feet.%K%P

0x110C
Haruka's cheeks are bathed in sunlight.%K%N

0x1118
The sea breeze begins to gently blow in the space%Nbetween us...%K%P

0x1124
—I wonder how long I've been watching Haruka like%Nthis.%K%P

0x1130
(For Haruka's sake alone, I will live through these next%Nsix days.)%K%P

0x113C
I think this over and over again.%K%P

0x1148
I will never let Haruka say she has "no heart" ever again.%K%N

0x1154
Because Haruka is her own person...%K%P

0x11E8
... Afterwards, I once again decide to let everything%Nhappen exactly the way it did before.%K%N%N

0x11F4
Our meeting with Kurumi, Izumi-san, and Saki...%K%N

0x1200
Buying the rice...%K%N

0x120C
Our dinner of paella...%K%N

0x1218
Going to the pool late at night...%K%N

0x1224
And the earthquake...%K%P

0x1230
Every single thing is a repeat of the events I%Nexperienced in the past.%K%P

0x1244
It's like watching a scene from a recording replay in front%Nof me... it's rather surreal.%K%N%N

0x1250
It's not just the events... I think I'm unconsciously%Nrepeating my own actions too.%K%P

0x12D4
Right now, I'm on the open terrace in Lunabeach.%K%N

0x12E0
We're all excited after the pool incident, discussing%Nwhether or not to go to the pool tomorrow.%K%P

0x12EC
Since I already know what the final verdict is going to be,%NI stare off into space as I tune out of the conversation.%K%P

0x12F8
Just... what am I?%K%N

0x1304
Even though I have memories of the future, everything%Nelse is exactly the way it was from the past, including my%Nbody and surroundings.%K%P

0x1310
I think as hard as I can, but I can't figure out how it's%Npossible.%K Maybe I've just gone nuts...%K%P

0x1334
Yuka「Diving?」%K%P

0x1340
I hear Yuka's conspicuously high voice.%K%N

0x134C
I stop thinking and focus on the conversation.%K%P

0x1360
Okuhiko「Yeah. There seems to be a place in the shopping district%Nwhere you can rent scuba gear...」%K%P

0x137C
Izumi「You can't, Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0x1390
Okuhiko「Huh, why not? I've already got my license, if that's what%Nyou're worried about.」%K%P

0x139C
Izumi「That's not it. It's because there'll be high waves%Ntomorrow.」%K%P

0x13B0
Okuhiko「Waves?」%K%P

0x13C4
Izumi「Right. There's an unseasonable tropical cyclone coming%Nin from the south, so it seems the waves will be high%Ntomorrow.」%K%P

0x13D0
Izumi「I heard about it from Gen-san, the fisherman, so there's%Nno doubt about it.」%K%P

0x13DC
Izumi「He complained that he wouldn't be able to go out to sea%Nand fish because of the storm.」%K%P

0x13E8
Izumi「Also, because this cyclone's migration velocity is slow,%Nit'll be like this for about a week.」%K%P

0x1410
Makoto「!!!」%K%P

0x141C
... This is horrible.%K%N

0x1428
I can't believe I forgot about something so important.%K%P

0x1434
Taking Haruka and escaping the island...%K%N

0x1440
That was supposed to be my last resort.%K%P

0x144C
Makoto「Izumi-san... if that's true, then does that mean the ferry%Nwon't go...?」%K%P

0x1460
Izumi「That's only natural. Until the sea calms down, service will%Nbe suspended.」%K%P

0x146C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1488
Yuka「What's wrong, Makoto?」%K%P

0x149C
Yuka「Geez, it's all right♪ If it's only for about a week, then it%Nshould be up and running again by the time the Camp%Nends, right?」%K%P

0x14A8
Makoto「Y-Yeah... you're right...」%K%P

0x14C4
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x14D8
Okuhiko「What's wrong, Haruka-chan?」%K%P

0x14E4
Haruka「He's acting strange...」%K%P

0x14F8
Okuhiko「Huh? ... You mean Ishihara? Don't worry about him. He's%Nalways strange...」%K%P

0x150C
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x1518
Haruka looks at me with concern. I return it with a%Nreassuring smile.%K%P

0x1534
(Yes, I'm all right... Even if I can't leave the island, I'll get%Nthrough this somehow! Because this time, I have my%Nmemories!)%K%P

0x1540
(So don't worry, Haruka... You have nothing to worry%Nabout...)%K%P

0x15B4
Before long, the time has come for us to return to the%Nlodge.%K%N

0x15C0
We walk down Moon Beach.%K Like last time, we've decided%Nto return by walking down the beach.%K%P

0x15F4
... Suddenly, I stop walking.%K%N

0x1600
I've just remembered something.%K%P

0x160C
(That's right... it was definitely around here that I found%Nthat "bell"...)%K%P

0x1634
I check my surroundings.%K%N

0x1640
At the beach, there's a group of lights coming from sea%Nfireflies.%K%P

0x164C
But unlike that time, I can't find it... That radiance lying in%Nthe beach...%K%PThat cold, stinging light.%K%P

0x1658
(Is it not here? No, that's impossible.)%K%P

0x1664
(Then can history change...?)%K%P

0x1670
... The changes are slight, but I feel as if this history is a%Nlittle different than the last one.%K%N

0x167C
For example, Haruka and I kissed two days earlier than%Nexpected...%K%P

0x1688
But thanks to that, I'm able to feel a sense of security.%K%P

0x1694
That small change will mutate into a large alteration of%Nhistory...%K%P

0x16A0
(Because I never found the bell, I never threw it away.%NThat means that Haruka also shouldn't be able to get it!)%K%P

0x16AC
I no longer feel hesitant...%K%P
