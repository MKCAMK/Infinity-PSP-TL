0x340
Kurumi「... Huh?」%K%P

0x34C
Makoto「The ocean's water is the moon's tears. That's why it's so%Nsalty...」%K%P

0x358
Makoto「Because the moon was all alone, it was lonely, and would%Ncry during the night. 'Sob, sob... sob, sob'...」%K%P

0x364

0x40C
Kurumi「... How...? Onii-chan, how did...?」%K%P

0x418
I spread open my palm.%K%P

0x424
In there is the soaking wet "me".%K%P

0x430
And then, I carefully unfold it so that I don't rip it... and%Nrestore it to its original square form.%K%P

0x43C
I crouch down at Kurumi's feet, and begin to fold it.%K%P

0x448
The paper and the ground are wet, so it's very hard to%Ndo.%K%P

0x454
But I become determined and keep folding it with all I've%Ngot.%K%P

0x460
Eventually, I finish folding, and then... I very carefully...%Nhold it up between my fingertips...%K%P

0x580
Kurumi「Onii-chan...」%K%P

0x5EC
Kurumi and I kiss each other on the lips.%K%N

0x5F8
Her lips are light and supple...%K%P

0x604
The tip of her small tongue touches mine.%K%N

0x610
The cold, wet sensation is transferred into me.%K%P

0x61C
Kurumi's lively breath was overflowing from her lips.%K%P

0x628
Raindrops flowing down our cheeks melted into our%Nmouths.%K%P

0x634
Smooth liquid... Spreading, flowing...%K%P

0x640
... The tip of my nose grazes her soft cheek.%K%N

0x64C
A childish scent is emitted from that cheek.%K%P

0x658
Her pure, innocent scent is brimming with life.%K%P

0x664
(Kurumi... is alive right here, right now...)%K%P

0x670
... Before long, our lips gently part.%K%N

0x67C
And then, we embrace each other as hard as we can.%K%P

0x688
Kurumi buries her face in my chest, trembling as she%Ncries.%K%P

0x694
Her scar warms my palm up.%K%P

0x6A0
Kurumi「Same... here.」%K%P

0x6DC
Kurumi「Onii-chan, your chest is...」%K%P

0x6E8
Kurumi「Very warm...」%K%P

0x6F4
As we are soaked by the rain, Kurumi and I become one.%K%P

0x700
Our bodies press together as if they're melting into%Neach other.%K%P

0x70C
The pelting rain continues to strike us.%K%P

0x718
We're not bothered by its chill.%K%P

0x724
Our bodies are burning up like a sun...%K%P

0x77C
Even if I go to the shrine right now, Kurumi probably won't%Nbe there.%N

0x788
She's definitely somewhere else.%K%P

0x794
I've got to find Kurumi by any means necessary before%Nshe arrives at the shrine...%K%P

0x7A0
There's no hesitation within me.%K%P

0x7AC
(I will definitely change history...)%K%P

0x7B8
I endure the pain, and begin to walk, dragging my legs%Nalong...%K%P

0x860
Before I know it, the drizzle becomes a constant rain.%K%P

0x86C
I desperately continue to walk as the rain hits me.%K%P

0x878
I look for Kurumi...%K%P

0x934
In my dim consciousness, I hear Kurumi's voice out of%Nnowhere...%K%P

0x940
Kurumi「Ready! ... Go!」%K%P

0x94C
Kurumi「Go, go!」%K%P

0x958
Kurumi「GOOOOO～～!」%K%P

0x964
Kurumi「Ring out! Sumo Crab wins～♪」%K%P

0x970
I want to look at it forever...%K%P

0x97C
I want to forever... watch over that angelic smile...%K%P

0x9BC
Kurumi「Cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die If-you-lie...♪」%K%P

0x9C8
Kurumi「Ah... what should we do if you lie?」%K%P

0x9D4
Kurumi「Let's see...」%K%P

0x9E0
Kurumi「If you lie, kiss Kurumi on the cheek... okay?」%K%P

0xA20
Kurumi「And she's decided to call Makoto-kun 'Onii-chan'♪」%K%P

0xA2C
Kurumi「Is that all right, Onii-chan?」%K%P
