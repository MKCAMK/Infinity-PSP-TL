Makoto「Sorry, guys!」%K%P

0xCC
... I suddenly speak up.%K%P

0xD8

0x218
Kurumi「Really...?」%K%P

0x224
Makoto「Yeah...」%K%P

0x230
Looking rather bored, Kurumi turns her gaze back to the%NTV.%K%P

0x23C
I can't shake the feeling that she didn't intend to stay%Nhere and watch "Oedo Gatten".%K%P

0x248
Then what's her reason for not wanting to go to the hot%Nsprings...?%K%P

0x254
As I think, I am taken aback as I realize something.%K%P

0x270
Now that I think about it, this is just like yesterday, when%NKurumi lied about having a headache so she didn't have%Nto go to the pool...%K%P

0x27C
Could it be that she's worried about her figure again?%K%P

0x290
Now that I think about it, this is just like yesterday, Kurumi%Nstayed behind alone at Lunabeach when we all went to%Nthe pool, right?%K%P

0x29C
At that time, she said it was because she had a%Nheadache, but...%K%P

0x2E8
Kurumi「Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x2F4
Suddenly, Kurumi asks me a question.%K%P

0x300
Kurumi「Wanna go see an interesting place?」%K%P

0x30C
Makoto「'An interesting place'?」%K%P

0x318
Kurumi「Yep, since today's 'Oedo Gatten' is boring.」%K%P

0x324
Kurumi picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and stands%Nup.%K%P

0x330
Makoto「Where is this 'interesting place'?」%K%P

0x33C
Kurumi「You'll see♪ Come with Kurumi♪」%K%P

0x350
Kurumi quickly runs out the front door, leaving with those%Nwords.%K%P

0x35C
Makoto「Hey, wait, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x368
I immediately go after her...%K%P

0x3EC
When we go out to the forest path, Kurumi grabs my hand.%K%P

0x3F8
While leading me by the hand, she steadily plunges%Nthrough the darkness.%K%P

0x404
The sensation and warmth of Kurumi's small hand%Npermeates through my own.%K%P

0x410
Her skin feels as soft as a baby's.%K%P

0x41C
Makoto「All right, that's enough. Can't you tell me where we're%Ngoing now?」%K%P

0x428
I ask her this.%K%P

0x434
Kurumi「Like Kurumi said, to an interesting place!」%K%P

0x440
Makoto「I know that... Then I'll change the question. How%Ninteresting is this place?」%K%P

0x44C
Kurumi「Hmm... let's see...」%K%P

0x460
Kurumi「Your heart goes pit-a-pat, pounds like a jackhammer,%Ngets all restless, and pumps you up... maybe that kind of%Nfeeling?」%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「That makes no sense at all...」%K%P

0x478
Kurumi「But it's something that can't really be put in words♪」%K%P

0x484
Haah... oh well, whatever...%K%P

0x490
I'll just be quiet and follow her...%K%P

0x4D8
We get on the coastline road, and just walk down it for a%Nlittle while...%K%N

0x500
... Kurumi abruptly leads me into a thicket.%K%P

0x538
Makoto「H-Hey, Kurumi!」%K%P

0x560
Kurumi doesn't listen to me, for she's entirely focused on%Nadvancing through the thicket...%K%P

0x56C
Before long...%K%P
