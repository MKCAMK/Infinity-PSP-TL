We decide to walk down Moon Beach instead of the%Npaved road.%K%P

0x68
As I am the last one to leave the shop, I follow the others%Nfrom behind.%K%P

0x74
At the head are Yuka and Saki, who are talking about%Nstories from their past.%K%P

0x80
Okuhiko, true to his skirt-chaser nature, looks at%NHaruka's face again and again while attempting to strike%Nup a conversation.%K%P

0x8C
... Just then, I stop walking.%K%P

0x98
At the beach, I come across a group of lights coming%Nfrom sea fireflies.%K%P

0xA4
Every time the waves break, the blue lights brighter than%Nneon begin to casually extend seawards...%K%P

0xB0
The moonlight sways on the surface of the charming%Nblack sea.%K%P

0xBC
The blue lights' boisterous dance, and the swaying%Nmoonlight...%K%P

0xC8
That romantic scene takes my breath away.%K%P

0xD4
The sea breeze is warm, atypical for a night in April...%K%P

0xE0
I feel like I could watch this forever, but as I'm staring, the%Nothers are getting farther and farther away from me.%K%P

0xEC
As I stare at the sea, I start walking again.%K%P

0xF8
Several steps later, another source of light shines into%Nmy field of vision.%K%P

0x104
It's a cold, stinging light...%K%P

0x110
―What is it?%K%P

0x11C
I stagger towards the source of the light as if it's%Ninviting me.%K%P

0x128
It's lying on top of the wave soaked sand.%K%P

0x134
I lean down and pick up the light...%K%P

0x14C
―!!!%K%P

0x160
It's that... "bell"...%K%P

0x198
Suddenly, a shiver crawls up my spine.%K%P

0x1A4
Goosebumps form all over my entire body, and my heart%Nviolently jumps up and down.%K%P

0x1B0
(It's... impossible...)%K%P

0x1BC
This is... This is... definitely what I saw in my dream...%K%P

0x1C8
The bell in my palm has a freezing cold metal texture...%K%P

0x1D4
It has a light crimson string...%K%P

0x1E0
... There's no mistaking it!%K%P

0x1EC
But why the hell is it here!?%K%P

0x200
I've looked at something that shouldn't have been%Nseen... I'm captured by feelings of intense guilt.%K%P

0x20C
I have to hide this truth.%K%P

0x218
―Right now!%K%P

0x224
Frightened to death, my body shakes as I throw the bell%Ntowards the sea.%K%P

0x24C
I want to quickly run away from this reality.%K%P

0x258
The bell flies in an arc before it sinks into the dark%Nocean...%K%P

0x264
My body won't stop trembling.%K%P

0x270
A scene passes through my mind...%K%P

0x284
―The hopeless nightmare from this morning...%K%P

0x298
I shake my head to erase that image from my mind.%K%P

0x2A4
(There's no way... something like that will happen...)%K%P

0x2B0
(Absolutely not... absolutely not...)%K%P

0x2BC
I repeat these words to myself again and again like a%Nspell.%K%P

0x2C8
(It just happens to resemble... the bell from that dream...)%K%P

0x2D4
(No, even if it was the same bell, so what...?)%K%P

0x2E0
(There's nothing to be scared of, right...?)%K%P

0x2EC
I feverishly run down the sandy beach.%K%P

0x2F8
I can't stop.%K%P

0x304
Though my feet are tripped up by the sand, I keep on%Nrunning.%K%P

0x310
The ominous ring of the bell echoes through my head...%K%P

0x394
As soon as I return to my room, I crash down on the bed,%Ncrawl under the sheets, and close my eyes.%K%P

0x3A0
I want to fall asleep right now...%K%P

0x3AC
By tomorrow morning, I'll definitely forget all of this ever%Nhappened.%K%P

0x3B8
However, the sound of my heart pounding loudly in my%Nears hinders me from sleeping.%K%P

0x3C4
(What if all the strange events that I've experienced%Ntoday were really premonitions...?)%K%P

0x3D0
(If that's the case... was that dream... a prophetic%Ndream?)%K%P

0x3DC
For argument's sake, let's say that's true. Then just who%Nwas... the girl in my dream?%K%P

0x3E8
―Yuka?%K%P

0x3F4
―Haruka?%K%P

0x400
―Saki?%K%P

0x40C
―Kurumi?%K%P

0x418
―Izumi-san?%K%P

0x424
Just which one of those five was it...?%K%P

0x430
Saturday, April 6th―on that day, which one of them%Nwill... die...?%K%P

0x43C
―No!%K%P

0x448
Why the hell am I thinking such bullshit...!?%K%P

0x454
There's something wrong with me...%K%P

0x460
I'm thinking like this just because I had three or four%Nweird things happen to me by coicidence...%K%P

0x46C
Of course! It's just a coincidence!%K%N

0x478
Everything's nothing more than a simple coincidence...%K%P

0x484
A simple... coincidence...%K%P

0x490
...%K%P

0x49C
The night feels like an eternity.%K%P

0x4B8
I finally fall asleep as dawn approaches...%K%P
