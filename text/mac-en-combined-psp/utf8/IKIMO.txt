0x26C
Izumi「I said that I wanted to have a long talk to you about your%Npremonitions, right?」%K%P

0x278
―Premonitions.%K%P

0x284
My blood runs cold at the mention of the word.%K%P

0x290
I've been trying to avoid this dreaded conversation, but%Nnow there's no escape.%K%P

0x29C
Izumi「Makoto-kun... Before we went fishing yesterday, you%Ncorrectly guessed that the car's battery was dead.」%K%P

0x2A8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x2B4
Izumi「And the day before that... you had predicted the lack of%Nrice and the earthquake, right?」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「And tonight's dinner... right?」%K%P

0x2D4
Izumi「... Yes.」%K%P

0x2E8
She sits down on a nearby stone, her head lowered as%Nshe remains deep in thought.%K%P

0x2F4
Following suit, I sit down next to her.%K%P

0x300
Izumi「Why...?」%K%P

0x30C
Izumi「Why did these things...?」%K%P

0x318
(These things?)%K%P

0x324
I feel a strange strange sense of discomfort in her tone.%K%P

0x330
It's like she knows this "something" that I don't...%K%P

0x33C
Izumi「Because... even though...」%K%P

0x348
Izumi「Something like premonitions is impossible...」%K%P

0x35C
Izumi「Why? Why do you know the future, Makoto-kun?」%K%P

0x368

0x374
Izumi「Please... tell me...」%K%P

0x380
Izumi-san's questioning eyes shine and sway in the%Nmoonlight.%K%P

0x38C
Those eyes are surprisingly clear and beautiful...%K%P

0x398
Makoto「Izumi-san...」%K%P

0x3A4
Makoto「I... I...」%K%P

0x3B0
My hands faintly tremble.%K%P

0x3BC
I try to answer her... but I can't...%K%P

0x3C8
Even I'm clueless about this.%K%P

0x3D4
Makoto「Izumi-san... I... really don't know.」%K%P

0x3E0

0x3EC
Makoto「Why did I have... that dream...?」%K%P

0x400
Izumi「... Dream?」%K%P

0x40C
I nod.%K%P

0x418
I feel that if it's Izumi-san, it's okay to tell her everything.%K%P

0x424
No, maybe I just want to get it off my chest.%K%P

0x430
I think that if it's Izumi-san, then she'll definitely%Nsympathize with the agony that lurks within my heart.%K%P

0x43C
Makoto「Everything began on that morning...」%K%P

0x448

Makoto「A dream...」%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「Where someone... died.」%K%P

Izumi「Huh? ... A dream about death?」%K%P

0x48C
Makoto「No matter what, I can't remember who the one that died%Nwas.」%K%P

0x498
Makoto「For some reason, all I can remember is the date...」%K%P

0x4AC
Izumi「...」%K%P

0x4B8
Makoto「Saturday... April 6th...」%K%P

0x4C4
Makoto「And if it's just like those premonitions I've been having%Nup until now, then...」%K%P

0x4D0
Izumi-san silently listens.%K%P

0x4DC
Occasionally, her eyes drift around as she thinks about%Nsomething.%K%P

0x4E8
Makoto「I wonder if... I might have gone completely insane...」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「Even I have absolutely no clue what's what...」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「It's like there's someone else within me...」%K%P

0x50C
Just then...%K%P

0x530
Izumi「Makoto-kun.」%K%P

0x53C
... Izumi-san suddenly mutters my name.%K%P

0x550
Just then...%K%P

0x564
... She embraces me tightly.%K%P

0x570
My cheek presses against her warm chest...%K%P

0x57C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x588
It was so sudden that I'm dumbfounded.%K%P

0x594
I can't speak. I can't move.%K%P

0x5BC
Izumi「It's all right...」%K%P

0x5C8

0x5D4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5E0
Izumi「Relax... Soon, everything will be back to the way it was...」%K%P

0x5EC
Izumi「Because everything... will end...」%K%P

0x5F8
I'm wrapped up in Izumi-san's kindness.%K%P

0x604
I feel peaceful and secure in her arms.%K%P

0x610
It's as if I'm being embraced by a goddess.%K%P

0x61C
Before I realize it, all traces of the agony within me has%Ndisappeared.%K%P

0x628
... ... ...%K%P

0x634
How long have we been like this?%K%P

0x640
I feel like I'm dozing off, as time seems to be passing%Nslowly.%K%P

0x64C
In the end, Izumi-san...%K%P

0x658
Izumi「Anyway, don't tell anyone else about the dream.」%K%P

0x664
Izumi「It's all right... because you have nothing to worry about,%NMakoto-kun...」%K%P

0x670
... whispers this softly into my ear, and stands up.%K%P

0x684
The ecstasy of tranquility that I felt lingered for a while%Nafterwards.%K%P

0x694
By the time my senses have cleared up, the Test of%NCourage has already ended.%K%P
