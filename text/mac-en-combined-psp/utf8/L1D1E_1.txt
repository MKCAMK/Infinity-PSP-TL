The moment we arrive at the top of the bank, we are%Nrewarded with a grand scenery that stretches out as%Nfar as the eye can see.%K%P

0xA8
The crimson colored sky starts fading into even darker%Ncolors.%K%P

0xB4
We're walking by a long, crescent-shaped beach, its%Nsands as smooth as velvet.%K%P

0xC0
There's nobody here except for us. The only sound is%Nthe soothing noise of waves crashing against the shore.%K%P

0xCC
The sea breeze gently brushes past my nose. It carries%Na sweet smell that is rather captivating.%K%P

0xD8
Makoto「So this is Moon Beach...」%K%P

0xE4
I can't quite hide the awe in my words.%K%P

0xF8
Yuka「Well? Didn't I tell you that this was a good idea?」%K%P

0x104
Yuka says this with pride.%K%P

0x120
That's right... On our way to the shopping district, Yuka%Nsuggested that we climb the bank on the east side of%Nthe road to see this sight.%K%P

0x12C
Makoto「Yeah, you were right.」%K%P

0x140
That's right... On our way to the shopping district, Yuka%Nsuggested that we climb the bank on the east side of%Nthe road to see this sight.%K

0x8D0
"Yeah, you were right."

0x8DC
"You really think so?"

0x188
Makoto「Yeah, you were right.」%K%P

0x194
I say this sincerely.%K%P

0x1A0
You're unlikely to see such a beautiful sunset in the city.%K%P

0x1AC
I haven't felt this moved by such a breathtaking%Nscenery in a long time.%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「You really think so?」%K%P

0x1DC
I know she doesn't expect me to say that.%K%P

0x1E8
Though to be honest, I'm utterly amazed. You're unlikely%Nto see such a beautiful sunset in the city.%K%P

0x1F4
I haven't felt this moved by such a breathtaking%Nscenery in a long time.%K%P

0x210
Makoto「We didn't have to go all the way here to see it, did we?」%K%P

0x21C
It's just... Um... I'd feel defeated if I were to admit that this%Nis "pretty."%K%P

0x228
I guess it's because I'm still sore over losing that bet in%Ntennis.%K%P

0x258
Yuka「Geez, you're not very honest... Ah, don't tell me you're%Nstill bummed out about the match?」%K%P

0x274
Okuhiko「Huh? What's that? Yuka-chan, what match?」%K%P

0x280
Okuhiko butts into our conversation.%K%N

0x28C
This is bad...! I don't want a guy like him to know that Yuka%Ncompletely thrashed me.%K%P

0x2A0
Yuka「Well, you see...」%K%P

0x2AC
Makoto「Hey, Yuka! Let's go down to the beach! It'll be better than%Njust watching from here the whole time!」%K%P

0x2B8
I quickly interrupt her story.%K%P

0x2CC
Yuka「Huh!? Hold on, Makoto! You didn't care about it earlier...」%K%P

0x2D8
Makoto「I was wrong! Looking at it again, it's such a lovely sunset,%Nisn't it? Those were just lies. Honestly, you can't find this%Nsort of thing everywhere. Nope, not at all.」%K%P

0x2EC
Yuka「But...」%K%P

0x2F8
In order to make sure Yuka doesn't object, I have to%Nresort to flattery.%K%P

0x304
Makoto「Yuka, thank you. If you hadn't suggested we climb up%Nhere, then we might have overlooked this.」%K%P

0x318
Yuka「R-really...?」%K%P

0x324
Makoto「Really! It's also finally gorgeous outside, and since we're%Nright by the coast, we needed to see this... We're all%Ngrateful to you. Right, Okuhiko?」%K%P

0x338
Okuhiko「Huh... Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0x34C
Yuka「I-It's not like I did anything special...」%K%P

0x358
She says that, but it's clear she's just being modest.%K%P

0x364
Makoto「Well, let's not just stand here all day. Shall we go down?」%K%P

0x378
Yuka「... Good thinking.」%K%P

0x384
Yuka regains her cheerful spirits.%K%P

0x390
Okuhiko seems like he wants to say something, but as%Nwe've already switched topics, it seems he doesn't feel%Nlike going back.%K%P

0x3B4
... The distance from the top of the embankment to the%Nsandy bottom is about 2/3rds of my height.%K%P

0x3C0
Despite the height, Yuka easily gets down onto the%Nbeach.%K%P

0x3CC
Okuhiko and I go after her.%K%P

0x3D8
―Then, at that moment!%K%P

0x484
I hear a loud thud from behind me, causing me to turn%Naround.%K%P

0x490
On the sandy beach is Haruka, who has hit the ground.%K%N

0x49C
It seems that she messed up her landing and fell.%K%P

0x4A8
She looks confused... she might not understand what%Njust happened.%K%P

0x4B4
I walk over to Haruka's side, grab her hand, and then%Nhelp her up.%K%P

0x4C0
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x4CC
As if nothing had happened, she gives me a curt nod in%Nreply.%K%P

0x4D8
However, it's clear that Haruka is definitely embarrassed.%K%N

0x4E4
She's blushing.%K%P

0x544
... ... ...%K%P

0x550
Before I know it, I've turned around.%K%P

0x574
I notice that Haruka is the only person still loitering%Naround at the top of the bank.%K%P

0x580
(... Huh???)%K%P

0x58C
Wait, didn't I just help her up?%K%N

0x598
So then why is she still there?%K%P

0x5A4
I break into a sweat.%K%N

0x5B0
My head is racked with confusion from my inability to%Ncomprehend the situation.%K%P

0x5BC
While this is happening, Haruka slowly doubles over.%K%P

0x5C8
She bends her knees and grips the edge of the%Nembankment. Judging from her stance, I already know%Nwhat's going to happen next.%K%P

0x5D4
"Wait!"... Before I can warn her, she's already in midair.%K%N

0x5E0
And then...%K%P

0x634
... Haruka loses her balance and falls flat onto the%Nbeach. A cloud of dust soundlessly stirs up into the%Nempty sky.%K%P

0x640
(This scene...)%K%P

0x64C
(This scene... definitely... happened a few seconds ago...)%K%P

0x658
Haruka looks confused.%K%N

0x664
I walk over to her side, grab her hand, and help her up.%K%P

0x670
Makoto「Are you all right?」%K%P

0x67C
I can't hide my shock.%K%P

0x688
Although Haruka gives a short nod, it's clear she's just%Ntrying to cover up her own embarrassment.%K%N

0x694
I notice that she's blushing.%K%P

0x6A0
As if trying to cover up her trembling, she quickly gets%Nto her feet and moves past me.%K%P

0x6D0
... For a little while, I stand frozen in place, dumbfounded.%K%P

0x6DC
―Was that d▲j▽-vu? No...%K%P

0x6E8
That's the phenomenon where after an event occurs,%Nyou're under the delusion you've experienced that%Nevent before.%K%P

0x6F4
But it definitely wasn't like that.%K%P

0x700
I saw Haruka fall before she actually did.%K%P

0x70C
I saw myself helping her up before it really happened too.%K%P

0x718
(Then just what the hell was that...?)%K%P

0x734
I quickly look up to see the red western skies are%Nburning dark red.%K%N

0x75C
The waves crash against the shore, bringing with them%Nthe echoes of the roaring ocean.%K%P
