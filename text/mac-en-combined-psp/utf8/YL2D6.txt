Suddenly, a clamorous sound echoes.%K%P

0x160
I open my eyes, and look towards the door...%K%P

0x174
(I-Izumi-san...)%K%P

0x180
Izumi「Kurumi's...」%K%P

0x18C
Izumi「Kurumi's gone!」%K%P

0x200
Izumi「I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night... and when I%Nlooked around...」%K%P

0x21C
Saki「Kurumi-chan was gone...」%K%P

0x238
Izumi「Yes...」%K%P

0x244
Izumi「I searched alone at first, trying all the places I could%Nthink of...」%K%P

0x250
Izumi「Inside the shop, the area around Moon Beach, all of it...」%K%P

0x26C
Saki「Do you know of any other places Kurumi-chan would go?」%K%P

0x278
Saki「Or do you have any clues...?」%K%P

0x284
Izumi-san softly closes her eyes, and gently shakes%Nher head.%K%P

0x290
Saki「Anyway, sitting still here won't get anything solved...」%K%P

0x29C
Saki rises to her feet, standing upright.%K%P

0x2A8
Saki「... Why don't we all quickly split up and look for Kurumi?」%K%P

0x2BC
Everyone files out of the door.%K%P

0x2C8
Before long, I'm all alone, still sitting on the dining chair as%Nstill as a decaying doll.%K%P

0x2DC
Haruka「... You're not going?」%K%P

0x2E8
Haruka「Makoto... you're not going to help look?」%K%P

0x2FC
Over Haruka's shoulder, I see Izumi-san's small figure.%K%P

0x308
Her eyes are filled to brim with tears.%K%P

0x314
She's worried... about Kurumi...%K%P

0x320
(What...)%K%P

0x32C
(What the hell am I doing...?)%K%P

0x338
(Why am I just sitting around like an old, rotten tree and%Ndoing nothing...?)%K%P

0x344
And, at that time...%K%P

0x37C
The cuckoo clock chirps five times.%K%P

0x388
And today's date is...%K%P

0x394
Makoto「Saturday, April 6th...」%K%P

0x3A0
Makoto「Saturday, April 6th...」%K%P

0x3AC
Makoto「Saturday... April... 6th!!!」%K%P

0x3C8
A flash runs through my mind.%K%P

0x3D4
I quickly look out the window.%K%P

0x3E0
—A downpour...%K%P

0x3EC
The rain clouds covering the whole sky are getting%Nbrighter.%K%P

0x3F8
(And just where is Kurumi?)%K%P

0x414
(Where... is she???)%K%P

0x428
(Where... is she???)%K

0x1CE8
Don't go help Kurumi.

0x1CF4
Go help Kurumi.

0x480
I know...%K%P

0x48C
I don't even need to think about it.%K%P

0x498
—Kurumi's in that shrine.%K%P

0x4A4
—And today is Saturday, April 6th.%K%P

0x4B0
The earthquake will happen soon...%K%P

0x4BC
But... But there's no way I can go there.%K%P

0x4C8
If Yuka and I go over there...%K%P

0x4D4
...%K%P

0x4E0
... Yuka?%K%P

0x4EC
Where's... Yuka?%K%P

0x4F8
No way...%K%P

0x504
No way, she couldn't have!!!%K%P

0x53C
—I kick off the chair and rush outside!%K%P

0x5FC
I look around for Yuka.%K%P

0x608
I don't see her amongst the others, who are out by the%Nfront door.%K%P

0x614
I shift my gaze to the tip of the forest path.%K%P

0x62C
I see the small retreating figure of Yuka running.%K%P

0x638
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0x644
When I come to my senses, I find myself running as fast%Nas I can.%K%P

0x650
I try to pick up my pace...%K%P

0x6A4
Saki「Hold on, Makoto-kun! Where are you going?」%K%P

0x6B0
Saki shouts at me from behind.%K%P

0x6BC
But there's no longer any time for me to answer.%K%P

0x6C8
This is a race against the clock...%K%P

0x6D4
My time limit... is already less than 30 minutes...%K%P

0x6E0
Although the muddy ground trips me up, I muster all of my%Nstrength and keep running.%K%P

0x718
History is repeating itself...%K%P

0x724
If Yuka goes over there right now, nothing will change.%K%P

0x730
Kurumi—she didn't go missing on the 4th.%K%P

0x73C
"History changed"... Yuka and I were overjoyed with that%Nthought.%K%P

0x748
But...%K%N

0x754
In the end, the same thing is happening.%K%P

0x760
Kurumi still disappeared. All that's changed is the date.%K%P

0x76C
"Laplace's demon" is smiling.%K%P

0x778
"Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning... Its occurrence is by%Nno means accidental, but in fact inevitable."%K%P

0x784
So history could never be changed!?%K%P

0x790
There's no way to change the direction of that giant%Ncurrent!?%K%P

0x79C
It swallowed us up, toyed with us, and finally made us%Narrive in the same place as last time...%K%P

0x7A8
(Why... did something this...)%K%P

0x7B4
My fists tremble with anger.%K%P

0x7F8
I finally catch up with Yuka in front of the long staircase%Nto the shrine.%K%P

0x814
Makoto「Wait, Yuka!」%K%P

0x820
I grab her arm from behind and turn her around.%K%P

0x8B4
Yuka「Go away!」%K%P

0x8C0
Yuka「Please... go away!」%K%P

0x8CC
Yuka「I've got to...」%K%P

0x8D8
Yuka「I've got to... save Kurumi-chan...」%K%P

0x8E4
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0x8F0
Makoto「It's hopeless... There's no way I can let you go there!」%K%P

0x8FC
Yuka「But Kurumi-chan's going to die...」%K%P

0x908
Makoto「But... if you go there, the same thing will happen!」%K%P

0x914
Yuka「I know that... I know that, but...」%K%P

0x920
Yuka「Kurumi-chan will...」%K%P

0x92C
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x938
Makoto「I understand...」%K%P

0x944
Makoto「In that case, I'll go save Kurumi.」%K%P

0x950
Yuka「No! I absolutely can't let you... absolutely not...」%K%P

0x95C
Yuka「Makoto, stay here...」%K%P

0x968
Yuka「I don't want to lose... another precious person!」%K%P

0x974
Precious... person...%K%P

0x980
Yuka「I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0x98C
Yuka「You went as far... as risking your own life... trying to%Nsave... mine...」%K%P

0x998
You're wrong...%K%P

0x9A4
That's wrong... Yuka...%K%P

0x9B0
It's the opposite...%K%P

0x9BC
I hesitated for a moment back then...%K%P

0x9C8
It's because I thought of myself first...%K%P

0x9D4
That's why I couldn't save Yuka...%K%P

0x9E0
I killed Yuka...%K%P

0x9EC
Yuka「Please... Please...」%K%P

0x9F8
I don't answer.%K%P

0xA04
Without a word, I brush past Yuka's shoulder, and walk up%Nto the front of the staircase.%K%P

0xA10
The rain beats on me...%K%P

0xA1C
The sound of the heavy rainfall drowns out all other%Nnoise.%K%P

0xA88
—I kick off the chair and rush outside!%K%P

0xB20
Saki「Hold on, Makoto-kun! Where are you going!?」%K%P

0xB38
But there's no longer any time for me to answer.%K%P

0xB44
This is a race against the clock.%K%P

0xB50
(Where's Kurumi?)%K%P

0xB5C
—That's obvious, isn't it!?%K%P

0xB68
—That shrine!%K%P

0xB74
And today is Saturday, April 6th.%K%P

0xB80
The earthquake will happen soon.%K%P

0xB8C
What if Kurumi's in the shrine at that time...!?%K%P

0xB98
My time limit... is already less than 30 minutes...%K%P

0xBEC
Although the the muddy ground trips me up, I muster all of%Nmy strength and keep running.%K%P

0xBF8
Yuka「MAKOTO! MAKOTO!」%K%P

0xC04
I hear Yuka shouting from behind.%K%P

0xC10
I already know what Yuka's trying to say.%K%P

0xC48
History is repeating itself...%K%P

0xC54
If I go over there right now, nothing will change.%K%P

0xC60
Kurumi—she didn't go missing on the 4th.%K%P

0xC6C
"History changed"... Yuka and I were overjoyed with that%Nthought.%K%P

0xC78
But...%K%N

0xC84
In the end, the same thing is happening.%K%P

0xC90
Kurumi still disappeared. All that's changed is the date.%K%P

0xC9C
"Laplace's demon" is smiling.%K%P

0xCA8
"Everything which occurs in the world has been%Npredetermined from the beginning... Its occurrence is by%Nno means accidental, but in fact inevitable."%K%P

0xCB4
So history could never be changed!?%K%P

0xCC0
There's no way to change the direction of that giant%Ncurrent!?%K%P

0xCCC
It swallowed us up, toyed with us, and finally made us%Narrive in the same place as last time...%K%P

0xCD8
Even if that's so...%K%N

0xCE4
Even if that's so...%K%P

0xCF0
I must go there!!%K%P

0xCFC
If that boy that I supposedly resemble could risk his life%Nto save Yuka...%K%P

0xD08
Then so can I!%K%P

0xD14
(Is this... what you call destiny?)%K%P

0xD58
I arrive at the long staircase that leads to the shrine.%K%P

0xD64
Without stopping to take a breath, I begin to rush%Ntowards the staircase.%K%P

0xD70
Just then...%K%P

0xD9C
??「Wait!」%K%P

0xDA8
... Someone suddenly grabs my arm from behind.%K%P

0xE00
Without giving me time to turn around, that person blocks%Nmy way to the staircase. It's...%K%P

0xE40
Makoto「Yuka...」%K%P

0xE4C
Yuka「Don't go!」%K%P

0xE58
Yuka「Please... don't go!」%K%P

0xE64
Makoto「Kurumi's... Kurumi's in this shrine.」%K%P

0xE70
Makoto「So I've got to... go...」%K%P

0xE7C
Makoto「I've got... to save Kurumi...」%K%P

0xE88
Yuka「No! I absolutely can't let you... absolutely not...」%K%P

0xE94
Makoto「Get out of the way, Yuka... There's no time...」%K%P

0xEA0
Yuka「If you go in there, things will turn out the same way%Nagain...!」%K%P

0xEAC
Yuka「Nothing will change...」%K%P

0xEB8
Yuka「We won't be able to return to the free world!」%K

0x1D00
I can't go back to the past again.

0x1D0C
We'll have another chance.

0xEF8
Makoto「Yeah... I get it...」%K%P

0xF04
Makoto「Certainly, that much is true right now...」%K%P

0xF10
Makoto「But...」%K%P

0xF1C
I take the bell out of my pocket.%K%P

0xF28
Its cool texture seeps into my fingertips.%K%P

0xF50
I drop... the bell... on the ground.%K%P

0xF5C
And then...%K%P

0xF84
... With all of my strength, I stomp on it.%K%P

0xF90
The smashed pieces of metal shine in a puddle...%K%P

0xF9C
They're like stardust...%K%P

0xFA8
In this very instant, I can tear off the chains of the%Ninfinite loop.%K%P

0xFB4
Makoto「... This is the end.」%K%P

0xFC0
Yuka「... Makoto...」%K%P

0xFCC
Makoto「I can't go back again...」%K%P

0xFD8
Makoto「I can't... go back to the past...」%K%P

0xFE4
Makoto「I will end... everything here...」%K%P

0xFF0
Makoto「So—」%K%P

0x1020
Yuka「No...」%K%P

0x102C
Yuka「I don't want that!」%K%P

0x1038
Yuka「No more... I don't... want this!」%K%P

0x1044
Yuka「I don't want to lose... another precious person!」%K%P

0x1050
A precious... person...%K%P

0x105C
Yuka「I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0x1068
Yuka「You went as far... as risking your own life... trying to%Nsave... mine...」%K%P

0x1074
You're wrong...%K%P

0x1080
That's wrong... Yuka...%K%P

0x108C
It's the opposite...%K%P

0x1098
I hesitated for a moment back then...%K%P

0x10A4
It's because I thought of myself first...%K%P

0x10B0
That's why I couldn't save Yuka...%K%P

0x10BC
I killed Yuka...%K%P

0x10C8
Yuka「Please... Please...」%K%P

0x10D4
I don't answer.%K%P

0x10E0
Without a word, I brush past Yuka's shoulder, and walk up%Nto the staircase...%K%P

0x10EC
... And then, just before I can take a single step...%K%P

0x1114
Yuka「I love you...」%K%P

0x1120
Yuka「I've loved you... all this time...」%K%P

0x112C
Yuka「It's true that I went to this shrine because I couldn't%Nforget that boy. But...」%K%P

0x1138
Yuka「But I realized it was wrong... That feeling was wrong...」%K%P

0x1144
Yuka「Makoto, I love you...」%K%P

0x1150
Yuka「From the beginning, from that moment where everything%Nbegan, I've loved you!!」%K%P

0x1178
The rain beats against me...%K%P

0x1184
The sound of rainfall drowns out all other noise.%K%P

0x1190
Those words comfort me...%K%P

0x119C
Just hearing those words alone is enough.%K%P

0x11A8
They're enough...%K%P

0x11B4
But unlike that boy, I'm not going to say a pretentious%Nline...%K%P

0x11DC
Makoto「Yeah... I get it...」%K%P

0x11E8
Makoto「But it's all right...」%K%P

0x11F4
Makoto「Because I'll get another chance...」%K%P

0x1200
Makoto「That's why—」%K%P

0x120C
Yuka「No! I absolutely can't let you... absolutely not...」%K%P

0x1218
Yuka「Makoto, stay here...」%K%P

0x1224
Yuka「I don't want to lose... another precious person!」%K%P

0x1230
Precious... person...%K%P

0x123C
Yuka「I don't want to lose you...」%K%P

0x1248
Yuka「You went as far... as risking your own life... trying to%Nsave... mine...」%K%P

0x1254
You're wrong...%K%P

0x1260
That's wrong... Yuka...%K%P

0x126C
It's the opposite...%K%P

0x1278
I hesitated for a moment back then...%K%P

0x1284
It's because I thought of myself first...%K%P

0x1290
That's why I couldn't save Yuka...%K%P

0x129C
I killed Yuka...%K%P

0x12A8
Yuka「Please... Please...」%K%P

0x12B4
I don't answer.%K%P

0x12C0
Without a word, I brush past Yuka's shoulder, and walk up%Nto the front of the staircase.%K%P

0x12CC
The rain beats on me...%K%P

0x12D8
The sound of the heavy rainfall drowns out all other%Nnoise.%K%P

0x1354
I move my still legs again.%K%P

0x1360
Yuka「MAKOTO!!」%K%P

0x136C
I begin to run up the staircase at full speed...%K%P

0x1378
I slip on the wet stone steps, falling on my knees, but%Nthere's no pain at all.%K%P

0x13B0
I reach the top of the stairs and and run like the wind%Npast the shrine's grounds.%K%P

0x13DC
Yuka「WAIT!」%K%P

0x13E8
I turn towards that voice.%K%P

0x13F4
Yuka's come chasing after me.%K%P

0x1400
Makoto「Stay away!」%K%P

0x140C
Makoto「Stay here...」%K%P

0x1418
But Yuka ignores me and runs past me, plunging into the%Nshrine.%K%P

0x1424
Makoto「Yuka!」%K%P

0x147C
I survey my surroundings, but I don't see Kurumi%Nanywhere.%K%P

0x1488
—Where's Yuka!?%K%P

0x1494
Right now, Yuka's trying to go through the small hole in%Nthe front wall.%K%P

0x14A0
Makoto「Hey! Yuka!」%K%P

0x14AC
Ignoring my shouts, Yuka disappears beyond the hole.%K%P

0x14EC
In the end, we've arrived here again.%K%P

0x14F8
Kurumi isn't here either.%K%P

0x1504
Only Yuka looks towards me, with eyes that seem to be%Nasking me something.%K%P

0x1560
—CRASH!%K%P

0x156C
—Rumble rumble!%K%P

0x1578
The slanting shrine's wall... slowly draws near us.%K%P

0x1584
Over the panicked Yuka's shoulder, I see segments of%Nthe thick pillars breaking up into small wood chips as%Nthey blow up in the air.%K%P

0x15AC
In the next instant, I hear the sound of the shrine%Ncrumbling...%K%P

0x15D4
—What should I do!?%K%P

0x15E0
My mind hesitates for a moment as I think this...%K%P

0x15EC
I'm hesitating again.%K%P

0x15F8
In this very instant, I'm thinking about my own body's%Nsafety.%K%P

0x1604
It's too late...%K%P

0x1610
It's all too late.%K%P

0x161C
I've fucked up... again...%K%P

0x16A4
I'm so... cold...%K%P

0x16B0
My whole body has gone numb. I can't move.%K%P

0x16BC
Strangely, there's no pain.%K%P

0x16C8
All there is is the taste of rusty iron in my mouth...%K%P

0x16D4
All of my other senses are completely paralyzed.%K%P

0x16E0
Suddenly, I am assaulted with severe nausea.%K%P

0x16EC
I throw it all up.%K%P

0x16F8
Blood...%K%P

0x1704
I threw so much blood that I could drown in it...%K%P

0x1710
The blood won't stop, as it overflows in my mouth and%Nguzzles down my throat.%K%P

0x171C
It seems I'm bleeding from other parts besides my mouth.%K%P

0x1728
My neck?%K%P

0x1734
Did I cut an artery in my neck?%K%P

0x1740
The blood begins to flow out of me relentlessly, like a%Nfaucet that's been left on full blast.%K%P

0x174C
My consciousness slowly begins to fade...%K%P

0x1758
I close my eyes partly, and focus my faint, dim field of%Nvision.%K%P

0x1764
Right in front of me...%K%P

0x1770
... lies Yuka.%K%P

0x1784
I can see her heavily dangling palm.%K%P

0x1790
On top of it is a small fragment of light...%K%P

0x179C
—The bell.%K%P

0x17A8
I muster the last of my strength to crawl like an insect%Nover to Yuka's side.%K%P

0x17B4
In my arms, I feel Yuka's skin is wet with slippery blood...%K%P

0x17C0
Yuka's cheeks are ghastly pale, almost transparent...%K%P

0x17CC
As if she were a doll made of glass.%K%P

0x17E8
Yuka「We couldn't... see the sunrise...」%K%P

0x17F4
Her hoarse voice fills this empty void.%K%P

0x1800
Before long, from Yuka's palm...%K%P

0x1830
... the bell falls.%K%P

0x183C
In that instant...%K%P

0x1848
—All light fades.%K%N

0x1854
—I've lost everything.%K%P

0x18FC
Yuka「I'll go with you, too...」%K%P

0x1908
—Huh!?%K%P

0x1914
In Yuka's palm is her bell.%K%P

0x1920
... Yuka...%K

0x192C
... throws...%K%N

0x1938
... the bell...%K

0x1944
... into the sea...%K%P

0x19C4
At the same time, I hear the sound of the shrine%Ncrumbling...%K%P

0x19D0
"I will definitely protect Yuka!"%K%P

0x19DC
—I don't hesitate for an instant!!%K%P

0x19E8
With all of my strength, I kick off the ground and leap%Ntowards her!%K%P

0x19F4
Like that, I push down on the ground and jump...%K%P

0x1A00
... With that force, we flutter around up in midair.%K%P

0x1A0C
"If you want to stop time, then it's all right to destroy%Ntime."%K%N

0x1A18
"If you want to escape from time, it's all right to flap your%Nwings."%K%P

0x1A24
"If you stay tied down, you can't be free."%K%N

0x1A30
"If you want to be free, then you mustn't be afraid."%K%P

0x1A3C
Yuka and I embrace each other as we fall down towards%Nthe black sea...%K%P

0x1A84
As I hear the faint sound of the bell Yuka threw away%Nclose to my ears...%K%P
