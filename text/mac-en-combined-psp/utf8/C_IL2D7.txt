Makoto「Hey, Kurumi!」%K%P

0xE4
Makoto「It's your fault things ended up this way!」%K%P

0xF0
I'm walking down the coastline road this morning on%Ncrutches.%K%P

0xFC
One of my legs and one of my arms are in casts...%K%P

0x108
According to the doctor, it appears I also fractured one%Nof my ribs.%K%P

0x11C
Kurumi「Why are you saying that〜? It's not Kurumi's fault〜!」%K%P

0x128
Kurumi「It's because of that ridiculous stunt you pulled,%NOnii-chan!」%K%P

0x134
Makoto「But you're the one who started it all... by saying those%Npuzzling things...」%K%P

0x148
Kurumi「Puzzling things?」%K%P

0x154
Makoto「On that rainy night, when I opened the door to my room...%Nyou screamed 'Kyaa!' and said that you were '20 years%Nold', right?」%K%P

0x160
Makoto「That's why I made that misunderstanding...」%K%P

0x174
Kurumi「If that's what you're talking about, then it couldn't be%Nhelped!」%K%P

0x180
Kurumi「Anyone would have at least screamed if you burst in on%Nthem changing clothes!」%K%P

0x194
Kurumi「Right, Haruka-san?」%K%P

0x1E4
Haruka「Yes...」%K%P

0x1F0
I can see Haruka's face faintly change color.%K%P

0x1FC
Makoto「And that's another thing- you confused me with the way%Nyou said 'she was changing clothes'! After all, there was%Nno reason for you to scream, right, Kurumi?」%K%P

0x208
Makoto「The one I saw changing clothes wasn't you...」%K%P

0x21C
Kurumi「That's not the problem! You peeked, you peeked!」%K%P

0x228
Kurumi「It's because you were peeking at Haruka-san while she%Nwas changing her clothes!」%K%P

0x290
Kurumi「Haruka-san's usual clothes... got soaked with beer%Nduring the barbecue, right?」%K%P

0x29C
Kurumi「She told me no matter how much she washed it, she%Ncouldn't get the stench of alcohol off of it...」%K%P

0x2A8
Haruka「That's why I asked Kurumi...」%K%P

0x2B4
Haruka「I thought she could try lending me her clothes...」%K%P

0x2C0
Makoto「And while Haruka was in the middle of trying them on, I%Nopened the door. The rest we all know...」%K%P

0x310
Makoto「But you know... Why were you changing in my room of all%Nplaces...?」%K%P

0x31C
Kurumi「Because Okkun had fallen asleep in Haruka-san's room.」%K%P

0x328
Haruka「Okuhiko got drunk and went into my room... and then he%Nfell asleep on the bed...」%K%P

0x33C
Kurumi「In short, it's because your room was free at the time,%NOnii-chan.」%K%P

0x348
Thinking about it now, it seems like that was the natural%Nthing to do.%K%P

0x354
The person I saw in the room... Their head was completely%Ncovered by their clothes, so all I could see was their%Nback.%K%P

0x360
The person who "noticed that I had opened the door"%Nwasn't the one changing clothes.%K%P

0x36C
In short, there were two people in my room... The one who%Nwas undressing, and the other who saw me open the%Ndoor.%K%P

0x378
Of course, the first person was Haruka, and the second%Nperson was Kurumi...%K%P

0x384
In the end, what I saw wasn't "Kurumi's back", but rather,%N"Haruka's back".%K%P

0x398
Kurumi「And when Kurumi said that she was '20 years old', that%Nwas a fact, so it couldn't be helped.」%K%P

0x3A4
Kurumi「Because Kurumi was born 21 years ago.」%K%P

0x3B0
Yes... that's right...%K%P

0x3BC
At that point in time, Kurumi had heard the whole truth%Nfrom Izumi-san.%K%P

0x3C8
It seems she told her on the afternoon of the 5th.%K%P

0x3D4
Now that I think about, late at night on the previous day,%NIzumi-san said this at the pool.%K%P

0x40C
Izumi「I've... already resolved myself...」%K%P

0x418
Izumi「Your words from back then have solved the worries%Nwithin my mind.」%K%P

0x458
That's why, the next day, Izumi-san told them as soon as%Nshe could.%K%P

0x464
As expected, Kurumi was shocked, but after seeing how%Nsincere Izumi-san was, she soon came to believe her%Nwords.%K%P

0x470
It seems that Izumi-san told Haruka the truth as well.%K%P

0x47C
That's why Haruka called her "Onee-chan" on that rainy%Nnight.%K%P

0x490
Kurumi「Hey, hey, Onii-chan?」%K%P

0x49C
Kurumi「More importantly, when are we gonna do 'that'?」%K%P

0x4A8
Makoto「'That'?」%K%P

0x4BC
Kurumi「Oh geez! Did you forget?」%K%P

0x4C8
Haruka「You mean the amusement park, right?」%K%P

0x4DC
Kurumi「That's right! The amusement park!」%K%P

0x4E8
Kurumi「Onii-chan, you promised that you'd take us, right?」%K%P

0x4F4
Makoto「Ye-Yeah... that's right...」%K%P

0x500
Makoto「But... if Haruka...」%K%P

0x514
Haruka「I've decided to go, too.」%K%P

0x520
Haruka「Makoto, you're paying for it all, aren't you?」%K%P

0x52C
Makoto「... Huh?」%K%P

0x540
Kurumi「'You're sisters, so it'd be unfair if you had to pay'... You%Nsaid that, right?」%K%P

0x54C
Makoto「H-Hey, I most certainly did-」%K%P

0x558
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x564
Kurumi「...」%K%P

0x570
Makoto「... say that.」%K%P

0x57C
That's my answer.%K%P

0x588
Their radiant smiles glow in the morning sunlight.%K%P

0x594
When they show me smiles like that, I can't turn them down.%K%P

0x5A8
Kurumi「Yay, yay〜♪ Just as planned...」%K%P

0x5B4
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x5C8
Kurumi「Hey, Haruka-san? Shall we go to the haunted house%Ntogether?」%K%P

0x5DC
Haruka「The haunted house, huh...?」%K%P

0x5F0
Haruka「I like 'Popping Deflating Babirinko' more than that.」%K%P

0x604
Kurumi「Huh? What's that?」%K%P

0x618
Haruka「Huh? You don't know it?」%K%P

0x624
Haruka「It's 'Popping Deflating Babirinko'.」%K%P

0x630
Kurumi「Kurumi's never heard of it...」%K%P

0x644
Haruka「But 'Babirinko' is so amazing!」%K%P

0x658
Kurumi「H-Hmm... is that so?」%K%P

0x66C
Haruka「It'll Babi your socks off!」%K%P

0x678
Haruka「It's really true!」%K%P

0x684
Haruka「No, it really does exist!」%K%P

0x6E4
While listening to their cheerful conversation, I continue%Nto walk at a leisurely pace.%K%P

0x700
—Clank.%K%N

0x70C
The tip of my crutches touch something.%K%P

0x718
I quickly look down at my feet.%K%P

0x724
The fragment of concrete is lying there.%K%P

0x730
This is where I collapsed early yesterday morning when I%Ngot sent flying by that car.%K%P

0x73C
I see something flashing.%K%P

0x748
It's coming from a corner of the road... The light is coming%Nfrom some weeds.%K%P

0x754
Makoto「Say, Haruka? Could you go pick that up over there?」%K%P

0x768
Haruka「Huh? Where?」%K%P

0x774
Makoto「There.」%K%P

0x780
Using one of the crutches, I point towards the weeds.%K%P

0x79C
Haruka bends down, and picks up the shining object.%K%P

0x7A8
Haruka places it in my unbroken hand.%K%P

0x7B4
—It's the bell.%K%N

0x7C0
It's smashed and crushed flat, but it's "that bell".%K%P

0x7CC
The surface has all these jagged scratches on it.%K%P

0x7D8
(So I really... did smash it?)%K%P

0x7E4
(On the night of the 1st, I successfully smashed the bell...%Nbut because it was so dark, I didn't realize that it had%Nflung away and was hidden in those weeds.)%K%P

0x82C
Kurumi「What's that?」%K%P

0x838
Kurumi looks at my palm.%K%P

0x844
Makoto「No... it's nothing.」%K%P

0x850
Makoto「This thing is just...」%K%P

0x85C
Makoto「—Junk!」%K%P

0x868
I say this, and throw the smashed bell towards the%Nocean.%K%P

0x890
The bell draws a clean parabola in the air as it flies.%K%P

0x89C
It momentarily flashes and shines in the sunlight, but%Nbefore long, I can no longer see it.%K%P

0x9D8
Haruka「See you later, Makoto!」%K%P

0x9E4
Makoto「Huh? You're not going back to the shop?」%K%P

0xA00
Kurumi「We have some business to take care of!」%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「You too?」%K%P

0xA18
Haruka「The two of us are going to watch crab sumo.」%K%P

0xA24
Makoto「Crab sumo... I see...」%K%P

0xA30
Kurumi「Besides, if the two of us are together, then we won't get%Nin your way♪」%K%P

0xA3C
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0xA50
Kurumi「Well then, later, Onii-chan♪」%K%P

0xACC
Kurumi and Haruka run off towards Moon Beach.%K%P

0xAE4
However...%K%P

0xAF0
Kurumi「Oh, that's right! Almost forgot!」%K%P

0xB14
Kurumi「Would you put these on the counter of the shop?」%K%P

0xB20
Kurumi takes something out of her pocket—it's the%Ncards.%K%P

0xB2C
As I take the cards from Kurumi...%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「What happened to these, anyway?」%K%P

0xB44
Kurumi「Yuka-san was the culprit!」%K%P

0xB50
Kurumi「On the afternoon of the 4th, we all gathered at the shop%Nbefore the barbecue, right?」%K%P

0xB5C
Kurumi「At that time, she borrowed them, but continued to%N'borrow' them after that.」%K%P

0xB68
When she says that, I finally realize it.%K%P

0xB74
I finally realize what Yuka's words at the barbecue%Nmeant...%K%P

0xBBC
Yuka「Hey♪ Mako-tan♪」%K%P

0xBC8
Yuka「Wen dis ish over♪...」%K%P

0xBD4
Yuka「Lesh play a fun game... all in sheecret♪」%K%P

0xBE0
Yuka「I borrowed dem earlier♪」%K%P

0xBEC
Yuka「... The tools, that ish♪」%K%P

0xC54
Kurumi「So anyway, Kurumi will leave it to you.」%K%P

0xC68
Kurumi「Good luck!」%K%P

0xC98
Kurumi then energetically runs after Haruka.%K%P

0xCB0
(What did she mean... "good luck"...?)%K%P

0xCBC
With my heart beating loudly, I reach out to open the%Nshop's door.%K%P

0xCC8
I remember the sensation of those wet lips.%K%P

0xD70
Izumi「Ah, Makoto-kun♪」%K%P

0xD7C
I bow my head.%K%P

0xD88
Izumi「What's this? You don't have to bow...」%K%P

0xD94
Makoto「No, it's just... well, uh...」%K%P

0xDA0
As I speak, my eyes remain fixed on Izumi-san's lips.%K%P

0xDAC
I want to feel those glamorous lips one more time.%K%P

0xDB8
Izumi「Hmm?」%K%P

0xDC4
Izumi-san tilts her head slightly.%K%P

0xDD0
Makoto「Oh, right...」%K%P

0xDDC
Makoto「Izumi-san... is your body all right now?」%K%P

0xDE8
Izumi「Yes, thank you♪」%K%P

0xDF4
Izumi「After resting for all day yesterday, I'm completely better.」%K%P

0xE00
Izumi「More importantly, what about you? Are you okay,%NMakoto-kun?」%K%P

0xE0C
Makoto「Yep, as you can see, I'm completely lively!」%K%P

0xE18
Izumi「No you're not!」%K%P

0xE24
Izumi「You're covered in bandages all over, aren't you...?」%K%P

0xE30
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xE3C
Izumi「...」%K%P

0xE48
Suddenly, Izumi-san's expression dims.%K%P

0xE54
Izumi「You... saved me again...」%K%P

0xE60
Izumi「I don't know... what I should say...」%K%P

0xE6C
Makoto「Hold it!」%K%P

0xE78
Izumi「?」%K%P

0xE84
Makoto「Don't talk like that anymore!」%K%P

0xE90
Makoto「That depressed face... doesn't suit you.」%K%P

0xE9C
I say that, then lightly pinch Izumi-san's cheeks.%K%P

0xEA8
I gently move them around with my fingertips...%K%P

0xEB4
Izumi「... Yes, I understand.」%K%P

0xEC0
Izumi「If you say so♪」%K%P

0xECC
Izumi-san's smile returns.%K%P

0xED8
It's a slightly bashful smile.%K%P

0xF20
... ... ...%K%P

0xF50
Izumi-san and I sit across from each other like we always%Ndo.%K%P

0xF5C
On the table is steaming black tea...%K%P

0xF68
The cards I got from Kurumi earlier are also on the table.%K%P

0xF74
Over Izumi-san's shoulders, I can see the enchanting%Nblue sky.%K%P

0xF80
It's as if yesterday's rain never happened.%K%P

0xF8C
Izumi「Makoto-kun? Would you take a little look at this?」%K%P

0xF98
Izumi-san takes a scrap of paper out of her pocket.%K%P

0xFA4
Izumi「This was folded inside of today's paper.」%K%P

0xFB0
A scrap of paper... It seems like some kind of leaflet.%K%P

0xFBC
(Why do I feel like I've seen this before...?)%K%P

0xFC8
"July 6th (Saturday) —Shiki no Mori(司紀杜) Festival."%K%N

0xFD4
"July 7th (Sunday) —Tokitsukasa (杜紀司) Festival".%K%N

0xFE0
"Invite all of your family members, and please%Nparticipate."%K%P

0xFEC
That's what's written on the bottom half of the paper.%K%P

0xFF8
Izumi「And here I thought I knew everything there was to know%Nabout this island...」%K%P

0x1004
Izumi「It seems I've still got a ways to go...」%K%P

0x1010
Izumi「The 'Tokitsukasa Festival' and the 'Shiki no Mori Festival'.」%K%P

0x101C
Izumi「I didn't know about these festivals up until now...」%K%P

0x1028
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1034
Izumi「Hey, Makoto-kun? Could you try reading this?」%K%P

0x1040
Izumi-san points to a part where "History of the Shiki no%NMori Shrine and the Tokitsukasa Shrine", is written.%K%P

0x104C
I continue to read the contents under the title.%K%P

0x1058
"The Tokitsukasa Shrine and the Shiki no Mori Shrine%Nwere built to honor twin gods from an ancient legend%Npassed down on this island."%K%P

0x1064
"In each shrine, a single silver bell was enshrined as an%Nobject of worship, and a mysterious power is granted to%None who touches one of the bells... Or so the legend%Nsays."%K%P

0x1070
Izumi「It seems that there were twin shrines built very close to%Neach other: the 'Shiki no Mori Shrine' and the%N'Tokitsukasa Shrine'.」%K%P

0x107C
Izumi「But the 'Tokitsukasa Shrine' was destroyed in an%Nearthquake a very long time ago.」%K%P

0x1088
Izumi「All that was left of it was its long staircase...」%K%P

0x1094
Izumi「Meaning what you saw that day were the remains of the%N'Tokitsukasa Shrine'.」%K%P

0x10A0
Izumi「The 'Shiki no Mori Shrine' should still be there right now.」%K%P

0x10AC
I see...%K%N

0x10B8
Did I not realize it because of that strange,%Nuncomfortable feeling in the forest while I was on my way%Nto the shrine...?%K%P

0x10C4
The road I went down was the one that lead to the%N"Tokitsukasa Shrine".%K%P

0x10D0
I don't know where I went astray, but Okuhiko and Saki%Nprobably went the right way and ended up at the "Shiki%Nno Mori Shrine".%K%P

0x10DC
(I think the two of them went there just because they%Nwere curious or something.)%K%P

0x10E8
(Or did Okuhiko actually have a dirty scheme in mind like%NI'd thought...?)%K%P

0x10F4
At any rate, I've now confirmed the reason why their%Npresences disappeared in the forest.%K%P

0x1100
Izumi「Humans are very shrewd...」%K%P

0x110C
Izumi「Even though the shrine's gone, they left behind a%Nfestival to at least to continue its memory...」%K%P

0x1118
Izumi-san says this, and brings her teacup to her mouth.%K%P

0x1124
The corners of her mouth form into a kind smile.%K%P

0x1130
When she returns the teacup to the saucer, her smile%Ngrows even wider.%K%P

0x113C
I can see her glossy, shining lips, wet from the tea.%K%P

0x1148
I can see the tip of her red tongue between her white%Nteeth.%K%P

0x1154
—Clang!%K%P

0x1160
When I come to my senses, I've sprung up from the chair,%Nand am now standing.%K%P

0x116C
Intense pain runs through my broken leg, but that%Ndoesn't matter right now.%K%P

0x1178
Izumi-san blankly looks at me.%K%P

0x1184
I just stay silent...%K%P

0x1198
... and kiss those lips.%K%P

0x11A4
I lean over the top of the table as far as I can... and%Npush my lips against hers.%K%P

0x11B0
The teacup in front of me falls with a clank.%K%P

0x11BC
The cards fall and scatter all over the floor.%K%P

0x11C8
There's no reason for this...%K%P

0x11D4
I'm just letting my body be driven on by its impulses.%K%P

0x11E0
Izumi-san's lips smell like sweet flowers.%K%N

0x11EC
I can feel the soft warmth of her leaking breaths.%K%P

0x11F8
It's proof that we're right here, right now.%K%P

0x1204
We're confirming each other's existences, and our%Nmaturing feelings.%K%P

0x1220
Before long, our lips part from each other...%K%N

0x122C
... Izumi-san says this last.%K%P"The stars will continue to shine for eternity..."%K%P"In the water... always... always..."%K%P"So don't... forget this shine, okay?"%K%P"We'll always..."%K%P"Be together, right...?"%K%PI silently rummage through my pocket.%K%PI take out...%K%P—The small glass bottle. The three stars are swaying in%Nthe water, twinkling brightly...%K%PThe cards spread out on the floor...%K%N... They're completely blank...%K%P%LC%C[afaTo see the Grand Finale, please watch this ending%Nonce more.%K%P
