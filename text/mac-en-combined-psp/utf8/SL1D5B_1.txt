I don't see Saki anywhere.%K%P

0x68
The summer house is so still and silent, it kind of feels%Nlike a haunted house.%K%P

0x74
Despite that, I pace around the building many times.%K%P

0x80
(It's as if I'm trying to hunt down Saki's lingering scent.)%K%P

0x8C
This feels like a scene taken straight out from a%Nromance novel.%K%P

0x98
I give up and turn around to try to return to the lodge%Nwhen... The puppy shows up from out of the bushes up%Nfront.%K%P

0xA4
It seems the puppy also recognizes me.%K%P

0xB0
Its innocent black eyes make me feel a little guilty.%K%P

0xBC
Although I wasn't trying to, I still ended up hurting it.%K%P

0xC8
However, the puppy hobbles over to me.%K%N

0xD4
It begins to coil around my feet like a spoiled child.%K%P

0xE0
I slowly crouch down, and pet the puppy on the head.%NDelighted, the puppy jumps up on my knees with its%Nforelegs.%K%P

0xEC
Makoto「... Where did your mistress go?」%K%P

0xF8
The puppy lets out a lonely whine.%K%P

0x174
I leave the puppy, and return to the lodge.%K%P

0x180
Yuka isn't in the living room.%K%P

0x18C
("Call Saki here one more time." ... Even though she asked%Nme that, where did she go?)%K%P

0x198
I find Haruka lounging on the sofa.%K%P

0x1AC
Makoto「Do you know... where Yuka went?」%K%P

0x1B8
I ask Haruka.%K%P

0x1C4
She silently shakes her head. I'll take that as a no.%K%P

0x1D0
Makoto「Now that I think about it, it doesn't seem like Okuhiko is%Nhere either.」%K%P

0x1DC
Haruka quietly points towards the bathroom.%K%P

0x1E8
From there, I can hear the sound of water running.%K%P

0x1F4
It seems that Okuhiko is taking a shower.%K%P

0x200
As I lightly nod in affirmation several times, my eyes%Nwander around for no reason.%K%P

0x20C
I'm thinking about what to do from now on.%K%N

0x218
No, I don't even need to think about it.%K%P

0x224
This situation... it's a rare chance where Haruka and I are%Nall alone.%K%P

0x230
(I'll try asking Haruka what I can't ask Saki!)%K%P

0x23C
Just as I think this and try to talk to her... Haruka%Nsuddenly speaks.%K%P

0x248
Haruka「... Makoto, there's too much you don't know.」%K%P

0x254
Makoto「Huh...???」%K%P

0x260
Haruka「It'd be best if you didn't get any closer to her... Because%Nyou don't know... You don't know what kind of person she%Nreally is... How terrifying she is...」%K%P

0x26C
Her sudden words leave me dumbfounded.%K%P

0x278
("Her"... by "her", she means Saki, right?)%K%P

0x284
Makoto「Say, Haruka? ... Why do you hate Saki so much?」%K%P

0x290
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x29C
Makoto「Saki's really a nice girl... I know that.」%K%P

0x2A8
Haruka「So you trust her more than my words...」%K%P

0x2B4
Makoto「You're wrong! It's not an issue of which one of you I trust!」%K%P

0x2C0
Haruka「I understand. It's fine...」%K%P

0x2CC
Makoto「No it's not! Haruka― what happened between you and%NSaki in the past?」%K%P

0x2D8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2E4
Makoto「The bell... That bell is connected somehow, right!?」%K%P

0x2F0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「Come on, won't you tell me?」%K%P

0x310
Haruka「Why don't you ask her...? You claim to understand her,%Nafter all...」%K%P

0x31C
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x330
Haruka turns her back to me. It seems she's no longer in%Na mood to talk.%K%P

0x33C
In this awkward atmosphere, Okuhiko comes out of the%Nbathroom with the worst possible timing.%K%P

0x348
I turn my face away to ignore him, but as expected,%NOkuhiko speaks anyway.%K%P

0x35C
Okuhiko「Ishihara... It really would be best for you to be careful%Naround Saki-chan.」%K%P

0x368
This guy... did he hear everything...?%K%P

0x37C
Okuhiko「Well, it's just my intuition. She's a hard one to read. I feel%Nas if there's something dark hidden deep in her heart%Nthat, if we try to pry, will cause trouble.」%K%P

0x388
What the hell is he saying...%K%P

0x394
He doesn't even know a thing about Saki...%K%P

0x3A0
I don't want to listen to Okuhiko anymore.%K%P

0x3AC
I silently head for the front door, and start to reach for%Nthe doorknob.%K%P

0x3C0
Okuhiko「Ishihara, be careful. Don't do anything offensive to%NSaki-chan right now...」%K%P

0x3D4
As I'm leaving, Okuhiko says this.%K%P

0x3E0
I resist the urge to punch him as I open the front door.%K%P

0x45C
I'm not heading anywhere in particular.%K%P

0x468
It's just that it's way too unpleasant inside the lodge%Nright now.%K%P

0x474
Everybody is talking so negatively about Saki...%K%P

0x480
In reality, I think this is all just a huge misunderstanding.%K%P

0x48C
Of course, I don't think Saki is guilt-free either.%K%P

0x498
But to hate her this much seems unfair...%K%P

0x4A4
Just then, I see the silhouette of a girl walking towards%Nthe harbor.%K%P

0x4B0
Though she's far away, I can tell that she's on the road%Nthat leads to the shopping district.%K%P

0x4BC
―It's Saki.%K%P

0x4C8
I instantly begin to run towards her.%K%P

0x4D4
I realize that I was lying to myself when I said, "I'm not%Nheading anywhere in particular".%K%P

0x4E0
I went to look for Saki.%K%P

0x4EC
Because I want to see her...%K%P

0x53C
I finally catch up to her at the entrance of the shopping%Ndistrict.%K%P

0x548
Makoto「Saki!」%K%P

0x554
It takes me a while to realize that I'm shouting at the top%Nof my lungs. Everyone on the street turns their heads%Nmy way.%K%P

0x560
Makoto「Saki!!」%K%P

0x56C
I don't give a damn. I call out to her in a loud voice once%Nmore.%K%P

0x578
Saki turns around.%K%P

0x584
My heart is burning with fire.%K%P

0x590
I run towards her as fast as I can...%K%P

0x5AC
Saki「... Makoto-kun!?」%K%P

0x5DC
I place my hands on my knees, panting heavily, and look%Nup at Saki's face.%K%P

0x5E8
My heart is brimming with deep emotions.%K%P

0x5F4
It's as if I've finally found someone I've been looking for%Nfor many years... it's that kind of feeling.%K%P

0x600
Saki「Why were you shouting like that...? Why were you running%Nlike a complete idiot...?」%K%P

0x60C
Makoto「I wanted to see you!」%K%P

0x620
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0x62C
Makoto「I wanted to see you, Saki!」%K%P

0x640
Saki「...」%K%P

0x654
Saki stares firmly at my face...%K%N

0x660
... And before long, she bursts into laughter.%K%P

0x66C
I raise my body up, wiping the sweat away. Saki is still%Nlaughing.%K%P

0x678
Makoto「Why are you laughing?」%K%P

0x684
Saki「... Because... you two are so alike.」%K%P

0x690
Makoto「'You two'?」%K%P

0x6A4
The instant I say this, I realize it.%K%P

0x6B0
(She's talking... about that puppy. In other words, I'm just%Nan ordinary mutt.)%K%P

0x6BC
Makoto「So I've been demoted from a slave to a stray dog?」%K%P

0x6C8
When she hears me say that, Saki instantly bursts out%Ninto loud laughter.%K%P

0x6D4
Seeing that happy face of hers causes me to laugh as%Nwell.%K%P

0x6E0
Our loud laughter echoes throughout the shopping%Ndistrict.%K%P

0x6EC
We ignore the bewildered glares of the people on the%Nstreet as we continue to laugh...%K%P

0x744
Saki and I aimlessly go to the harbor.%K%P

0x750
Our laughter has refreshed the mood.%K%P

0x75C
(I can just forget about minor details for now...)%K%P

0x768
(At the very least, I understand Saki.)%K%P

0x774
(That alone is enough, isn't it...?)%K%P

0x788
Makoto「When I was a kid, I wanted to raise a dog... I'd often give%Nfood to stray dogs, which annoyed my parents.」%K%P

0x794
Makoto「They'd say 'What are you going to do if it gets attached%Nto you!?'」%K%P

0x7A0
Saki「When that happens, you start to beg, pleading pitifully to%Nraise it. But after a few days, people get tired of the dog%Nand kick them away when they follow you around.」%K%P

0x7AC
Makoto「Th-That's...」%K%P

0x7B8
It seems that Saki has misunderstood my actions from%Nthis morning.%K%P

0x7CC
Saki「If that's the case, then it's irresponsible to pity it from%Nthe start...」%K

0x11F8
"Yeah... that might be right."

0x1204
"You think so?"

0x80C
Makoto「Yeah... that might be right.」%K%P

0x820
When I answer, a slightly surprised expression appears%Non Saki's face.%K%P

0x82C
She immediately looks away, and answers while talking%Nquickly.%K%P

0x850
Makoto「You think so?」%K%P

0x85C
Saki「Of course!」%K%P

0x868
Makoto「Hmm...」%K%P

0x87C
Saki「Do you want to say that's wrong?」%K%P

0x890
Makoto「I don't think it was all a mistake, but... umm... how do I put%Nit...?」%K%P

0x89C
Makoto「... Isn't just being able to feel sympathetic towards a%Npitiful dog in need the important thing?」%K%P

0x8A8
Saki「...」%K%P

0x8B4
Makoto「I don't think it's irresponsible if you think that way. It's not%Nwrong to be sympathetic towards it.」%K%P

0x8C0
Makoto「If anything, the way you've helped that puppy only%Nshows how kind and selfless you are...」%K%P

0x8CC
Makoto「The most important thing is to ask yourself how willing%Nare you to take care of it and go from there...」%K%P

0x8E0
Saki「...」%K%P

0x8EC
A slightly surprised expression appears on Saki's face.%K%P

0x8F8
Makoto「... Ha ha... what the hell am I saying? Even I don't really%Nunderstand what I'm talking about.」%K%P

0x904
As I laugh in an attempt to distract me from my%Nembarrassment, Saki frantically looks away from me.%K%P

0x918
Saki「I understand just a little bit...」%K%P

0x92C
Saki「But how many people could actually think that way? The%Nworld is full of egoists, people who are only concerned%Nabout themselves!」%K%P

0x938
Saki「I can't trust people because they're like that.」%K%P

0x94C
She can't... trust people...%K%P

0x958
Makoto「So is that why... you like plants and animals so much?」%K%P

0x96C
Saki「That's right. They don't speak words. They don't need to.」%K%P

0x980
Makoto「Saki...」%K%P

0x994
Saki suddenly begins walking.%K%P

0x9A0
She quickly heads towards the pier.%K%P

0xA1C
Saki walks straight to the tip of the pier.%K%P

0xA28
I follow her.%K%P

0xA3C
The sea breeze blows strongly. The approaching waves%Ncrash against the pier, shooting up white sheets of%Nspray.%K%P

0xA48
Saki is at the tip of the pier, not moving an inch.%K%P

0xA54
I stand next to Saki, and quietly start talking to her.%K%P

0xA60
Makoto「You can't trust people because they speak with words?」%K%P

0xA6C
Saki「...」%K%P

0xA78
Makoto「Why...?」%K%P

0xA84
Saki「Because they lie.」%K%P

0xA90
Makoto「Lie...?」%K%P

0xA9C
Saki「Humans are just liars.」%K%P

0xAA8
Makoto「...」%K%P

0xAC4
Saki「That's why I can't.」%K%P

0xB08
Crash! The waves break, and a sheet of spray hits Saki%Nin the face.%K%P

0xB14
But Saki doesn't seem fazed by the water, and just%Nsilently stares at the sea.%K%P

0xB20
―"Because they lie, I can't trust humans."%K%P

0xB2C
In that instant, I recall Yuka's words.%K%P

0xB38
Makoto「The Magician's Portrait...」%K%P

0xB44
I say this out loud.%K%P

0xB58
Saki「!!!」%K%P

0xB64
Saki instantly trembles in shock, and turns towards me.%K%P

0xB70
Makoto「It was during your cultural festival in middle school, ri-」%K%P

0xB7C
Saki「Did Yuka tell you...?」%K%P

0xB88
I give her a slow nod.%K%P

0xB9C
Saki「I... I wanted... to look at it all alone.」%K%P

0xBA8
Saki's eyes fill with tears...%K%P

0xBBC
Saki「I just wanted to see it alone when no one was around!」%K%P

0xBC8
The instant she says this, large tears pour from her%Neyes.%K%P

0xBD4
She tries to control herself by standing rigidly as if%Nshe's rooted into the ground, but her thin shoulders%Nquiver.%K%P

0xBE0
She clenches her hands into tight fists.%K%P

0xBEC
The tears flying off her face... fall onto those small fists.%K%P

0xBF8
Makoto「The magician Yuka drew... was really incredible, wasn't it?」%K%P

0xC04
Saki looks at me.%K%P

0xC10
Her gaze is filled with loneliness.%K%P

0xC1C
Saki nods while biting her lip.%K%P

0xC28
New tears overflow her eyes.%K%P

0xC34
She's trying to overcome her "bitterness"...%K%P

0xC40
That's right...%K%N

0xC4C
Saki was bitter.%K%N

0xC58
She was just bitter...%K%P

0xC64
That's why she snuck into school in the middle of the%Nnight, in order to see the picture all alone.%K%P

0xC70
She must have been crying like she is now when she%Nlooked up at the "Magician's Portrait".%K%P

0xC7C
Was it foolish pride? ... That might be it.%K%P

0xC88
It was just the pride of a selfish rich girl who was%Nignorant of the ways of the world.%K%P

0xC94
In a way, I find it kind of cute.%K%P

0xCA0
I think that Saki is cute from the bottom of my heart.%K%P

0xCAC
Makoto「Hey, Saki? I was thinking...」%K%P

0xCB8
Saki「...」%K%P

0xCC4
Makoto「'It seems a janitor on patrol saw Saki running'... Yuka said%Nthat, but...」%K%P

0xCD0
Makoto「In reality, you weren't running away because you%Ndestroyed the painting, right?」%K%P

0xCE4
Saki「... Huh?」%K%P

0xCF0
Makoto「You just... didn't want anyone to see you crying...」%K%P

0xCFC
Saki「...」%K%P

0xD08
Makoto「... Isn't that right?」%K%P

0xD1C
Saki gives a light, lonely nod while muttering.%K%P

0xD28
Saki「The only ones who will listen to what I have to honestly%Nsay is this stray cat who lives at my school and this%Ncherry blossom tree on my campus...」%K%P

0xD34
Makoto「... You're wrong, Saki...」%K%P

0xD40
Makoto「There's one more person you can talk honestly to...」%K%P

0xD54
Saki「...?」%K%P

0xD60
Makoto「He's right here.」%K%P

0xD6C
Saki「Makoto-kun...」%K%P

0xD78
Makoto「You don't need words...」%K%P

0xD84
Makoto「I'll become the cat and the cherry blossom tree.」%K%P

0xD90
Tears fill up Saki's eyes yet again.%K%P

0xD9C
I embrace Saki without a word.%K%P

0xDB0
Makoto「That's enough. I don't want to see you cry...」%K%P

0xDBC
Saki nods while burying her face into my chest.%K%P

0xE20
... If this were a movie, then things would have ended%Nperfectly, but...%K%N

0xE2C
... Reality is something that doesn't often go that well...%K%P

0xE5C
Saki「Will you always trust me?」%K%P

0xE68
Makoto「I will.」%K%P

0xE7C
Saki「Only me?」%K%P

0xE88
Makoto「... Only... you?」%K%P

0xE9C
Saki「I won't accept it if it's not only me. Ab-so-lute-ly-not!」%K%P

0xEA8
Makoto「Y-Yeah...」%K%P

0xEB4
I mumble this, intimidated.%K%P

0xEC8
Saki「What's with that weak response?」%K%P

0xED4
Makoto「I'm serious! I'll trust only you! No matter what happens!」%K%P

0xEE8
Saki「Then swear it.」%K%P

0xEF4
Makoto「Huh!?」%K%P

0xF08
Saki「Swear it, dammit!」%K%P

0xF14
Makoto「Haah... cut me a break...」%K%P

0xF28
Saki「You say something?」%K%P

0xF34
Makoto「No... nothing...」%K%P

0xF40
This terrifying desire to monopolize is definitely the%Nresult of Saki's great pride.%K%P

0xF4C
God, such a troublesome rich girl...%K%P
