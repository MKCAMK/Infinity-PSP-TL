... After that, we talk about many things.%K%P

0x60
We're all chatting like the best of friends despite it only%Nbeing our first meeting.%K%P

0x6C
After listening to everyone's fun stories, I've slowly%Nstopped worrying about my premonitions.%K%P

0x88
Saki「... Well, isn't it about time we all went home?」%K%P

0x94

0xC8
Makoto「Huh? Really?」%K%P

0xD4

0x164
Makoto「I don't really care, so sure.」%K%P

0x170
I don't have a reason to oppose this.%K%P

0x17C
It's only natural, but if we're going to the pool, then%Neveryone will likely be in their swimsuits.%K%P

0x188
That's an opportunity simply too tempting for a guy to%Npass up...%K%P

0x194

0x1EC
Izumi「You can't, Okuhiko-kun.」%K%P

0x200
Okuhiko「Huh, why not? I've already got my license, if that's what%Nyou're worried about.」%K%P

0x20C
Izumi「That's not it. It's because there'll be high waves%Ntomorrow.」%K%P

0x220
Okuhiko「Waves?」%K%P

0x22C

0x238
Izumi「I heard about it from Gen-san, the fisherman, so there's%Nno doubt about it.」%K%P

0x244
Izumi「He complained that he wouldn't be able to go out to sea%Nand fish because of the storm.」%K%P

0x250
Izumi「Also, because this cyclone's migration velocity is slow,%Nit'll be like this for about a week.」%K%P

0x264

0x2D4
Kurumi「Kurumi will...」%K%P

0x2E8
Yuka「...?」%K%P

0x2F4
