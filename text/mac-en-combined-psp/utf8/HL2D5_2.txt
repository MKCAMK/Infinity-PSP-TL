??「Makoto... Makoto...」%K%P

0x58
Someone's calling my name... who is it?%K%P

0x64
Is that... Haruka's voice?%K%P

0x70
Haruka「Makoto! Makoto!」%K%P

0x7C
Ugh... let me sleep a little longer.%K%P

0x88
As I try to turn over in my sleep, I am met with resistance.%K%P

0x94
Haruka「Hey, Makoto! Makoto!」%K%P

0xA0
Haruka grabs my shoulders and rocks them back and%Nforth.%K%P

0xAC
I-I get it... I'm up, I'm up...%K%P

0xC0
Wh-Whoa!%K%P

0xDC
When I raise my upper body and open my eyes, I see,%Nmere inches away from me, Haruka's... face!?%K%P

0xE8
Haruka「Kyaa...!」%K%P

0x31C
Owww... We bump our foreheads into each other.%K%P

0x328
I can see stars flying around me.%K%P

0x360
Haruka「Ow...」%K%P

0x36C
Haruka frowns as she nurses her sore forehead.%K%P

0x378
Makoto「... Wh-What were you doing, Haruka?」%K%P

0x38C
Haruka「Makoto... you were having trouble waking up, so...」%K%P

0x398
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x3A4
I finally remember the last time we had this conversation.%K%P

0x3B8
Haruka「Have you ever read... 'Sleeping Beauty'?」%K%P

0x3C4
Makoto「The Grimm Brothers' story was 'Briar Rose'―and%N'Sleeping Beauty' was by Perrault... right?」%K%P

0x3D8
Haruka「You're well informed. That's right... but the story is the%Nsame. There was this princess who slept for hundreds%Nof years, right?」%K%P

0x3E4
Makoto「Yeah, that's right. And then, a prince finally came to the%Nprincess in order to wake her up, and then...」%K%P

0x3F8
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x404
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x418
Haruka「Now that you're awake, let's go fishing.」%K%P

0x424
It seems that to Haruka, it's already been decided that%NI'm to go fishing with her.%K%P

0x430
Even though I still haven't said anything...%K%P

0x43C
Nonetheless, I quickly begin to get ready, since I want to%Nspend as much time with Haruka as possible.%K%P

0x448
Haruka firmly watches me.%K%P

0x454
Makoto「Haruka... I'm going to change my clothes soon...」%K%P

0x460
Haruka「Right.」%K%P

0x46C
Makoto「... I'll be naked, so, uh...」%K%P

0x480
Haruka「R-Right... I'll be waiting by the front door...」%K%P

0x494
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x4A8
Haruka「... What?」%K%P

0x4B4
Makoto「It was the prince that kissed the princess in 'Sleeping%NBeauty', not the other way around.」%K%P

0x4C0
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x4CC
Makoto「... That's it.」%K%P

0x4E0
Haruka「Yes, I understand.」%K%P

0x4EC
Makoto「I wouldn't try to wake up anyone else with that method.」%K%P

0x508
Haruka「... You're the only one I'd ever wake up with that method.」%K%P

0x560
Turning around, Haruka quickly leaves with those words.%K%P

0x56C
Makoto「Huh...? Did she just say...?」%K%P

0x5F8
... And so, we've arrived at this pier once again.%K%P

0x604
How many times have we come here, counting today?%K%N

0x610
I try counting with my fingers...%K%P

0x61C
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...%K%N

0x628
6 times... This is my sixth time.%K%N

0x634
Of course, to Haruka, this is just the 3rd time.%K%P

0x648
Haruka「Look, I caught a really big one this time!」%K%P

0x654
Haruka brightly exclaims this. She's all smiles today.%K%P

0x660
Her smile is bright and clear, a heavy contrast to the%Ndark clouds hanging overhead.%K%P

0x66C
In my heart, I'm exactly the same.%K%P

0x678
I'm having fun being together with Haruka.%K%N

0x684
However, dark clouds still shroud the corners of my%Nheart.%K%P

0x690
I'm still anguishing because I still haven't found the%Ndecisive difference between Haruka and Kurumi...%K%P

0x69C
Haruka「Ah, looks like I got another bite♪」%K%P

0x6B0
While I'm feeling uneasy, Haruka is in an extremely good%Nmood.%K%P

0x6BC
Her smile is very dazzling and radiant.%K%P

0x6C8
Makoto「Haruka... you seem pretty happy.」%K%P

0x6D4
I say this spontaneously.%K%P

0x720
Haruka「Well, that's because... it's fun being with you... Up until now,%NI've never done things like this with another person.」%K%P

0x72C
Haruka「So don't make that sad face... When you're sad, I'm sad%Ntoo... It's true. I only have you, Makoto... only you...」%K%P

0x738
I wasn't expecting that answer.%K%N

0x744
I must have accidentally let my anxiety show.%K%P

0x750
And Haruka, being as sensitive as she is, must have%Nsensed my subtle shift in mood instantly.%K%P

0x75C
Haruka frowns when she sees how unhappy I look.%K%P

0x768
It seems I've made Haruka grow gloomy.%K%P

0x77C
And then... Haruka suddenly leans over on my shoulders.%K%P

0x788
I feel her comfortable weight against me.%K%P

0x794
My senses become sharply more aware of how precious%Nthe existence known as Haruka is.%K%P

0x7A0
(What the hell am I doing...?)%K%P

0x7AC
(I'm trying to protect Haruka... but instead, all I'm doing is%Nhurting her, right?)%K%P

0x7B8
(Even though she's thinking of me so much... in the end, is%Nthere nothing I can do for Haruka?)%K%P

0x7D4
―!?%K%P

0x80C
Suddenly, something inside me bursts open loudly.%K%P

0x818
"Something that Haruka has that Kurumi doesn't."%K%N

0x824
%W%W%W%WWhen I think about it, it's so simple.%K%P

0x830
That's right... It's "the feelings Haruka has for me."%K%N

0x83C
And also, "The love I have for Haruka."%K%P

0x850
To me, Haruka is a precious existence that can't be%Nreplaced.%K%P

0x85C
Because Haruka is Haruka, I truly love her.%K%P

0x868
There is not a single thing or person that exists in this%Nworld who could replace Haruka!%K%P

0x8A4
I gently embrace Haruka, and spontaneously kiss her on%Nher lips.%K%P

0x8B0
Haruka's soft lips... her body temperature... they're so%Nwarm...%K%P

0x8C4
Makoto「Haruka, I love you...」%K%P

0x8D0
Makoto「All this time... Yes, I've loved you all this... mmm.」%K%P

0x8E4
My confession is interrupted midway.%K%N

0x8F0
I feel Haruka kissing my lips again.%K%P

0x8FC
Our time slowly passes by...%K%P

0x908
... Before long... Haruka gently whispers this.%K%P

0x91C
Haruka「I love you too. I love you so much!」%K%P

0x928
Makoto「Haruka...」%K%P

0x934
Makoto「Say, Haruka... listen carefully...」%K%P

0x940
Haruka「...? ... What?」%K%P

0x94C
Makoto「Earlier, you said 'I have no heart', right?」%K%P

0x958
Haruka「... Yes.」%K%P

0x964
Makoto「But if you don't have a heart, then you shouldn't be able%Nto fall in love with someone...」%K%P

0x970
Makoto「Which means... you lied when said you loved me...」%K%P

0x97C
Haruka「... That's not... That's not true! I really do love you!!」%K%P

0x988
Makoto「Well then, doesn't that mean you really do have a heart?」%K%P

0x994
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x9A0
With a bewildered expression, Haruka averts her gaze%Nfrom me.%K%P

0x9AC
Makoto「Say, Haruka...」%K%P

0x9B8
Makoto「Don't lie to yourself...」%K%P

0x9C4
Makoto「Since the day you were born, you've had a kind heart.」%K%P

0x9D0
Makoto「You let go of the fish that you catch because you can%Nfeel for them...」%K%P

0x9DC
(If you didn't, you wouldn't have risked your life to save%Nthat puppy...)%K%P

0x9E8
Makoto「Even so, you deceive yourself.」%K%P

0x9F4
Makoto「Saying things like 'I have no heart'... That's just you%Ndeceiving your own feelings...」%K%P

0xA00
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xA0C
Makoto「'I'm different from humans... I'm a worthless existence%Nthat's a replacement for another...'」%K%P

0xA18
Makoto「... That's a pretense you made up yourself... Nothing more%Nthan a delusion...」%K%P

0xA24
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xA30
Makoto「Listen, Haruka.」%K%P

0xA3C
Makoto「There's not a single person in this world who could ever%Nreplace you!」%K%P

0xA48
Makoto「I love you because you are who you are!」%K%P

0xA54
Makoto「To me, you are the most important existence in the whole%Nworld, someone that can never be replaced by anything%Nelse!!」%K%P

0xA68
Haruka「...」%K%P

0xA74
Makoto「So... never... say that again...」%K%P

0xA80
Makoto「That you have no heart... or that you're worthless...%NNever say those things again...」%K%P

0xA8C
Haruka「... Yes...」%K%P

0xAC4
With that, we decide to kiss for a third time.%K%P

0xAD0
Before I knew it, large teardrops had started falling from%NHaruka's eyes.%K%P

0xADC
Haruka's face, soggy with tears... is absolutely beautiful.%K%P

0xAE8
... Yes, it's a peaceful expression that looks like she's%Nbeen released from a curse.%K%P

0xAF4
This is the true Haruka...%K%N

0xB00
... This is "Haruka"...%K%P

0xB0C
My cheeks are warm from Haruka's tears...%K%P

0xB58
If I were to say anything about the change in Haruka%Nafter that, all I can say is that it's beyond description.%K%P

0xB64
Haruka「Huh? And then what happened?」%K%P

0xB70
Everyone「...」%K%P

0xB7C
When they see how cheerful Haruka's expression is and%Nhow she practically can't be compared to her past self,%Nno one can hide their surprise.%K%P

0xB90
Okuhiko「Ishihara, what did you do to her? I've never thought I'd%Nsee Haruka-chan of all people smile like that... Dammit, if%Nit's true, then that should have been my role!」%K%P

0xBAC
Even when the others are in the middle of talking,%NHaruka's eyes are solely focused on me.%K%P

0xBC0
When our eyes meet, I give her a broad grin.%K%P

0xBCC
Haruka smiles at it.%K%P

0xBD8
I feel happier than I ever have in my entire life...%K%P
