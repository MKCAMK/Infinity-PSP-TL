Even though she shouldn't be far ahead, I still lose sight%Nof Haruka at the forest path.%K%P

0x70
When I come out of the forest road and into the%Ncoastline, I arrive at a crossroads.%K There's this small%Ncove called Princess Beach, to the west, and it seems%Nlike the east leads to a long beach called Moon Beach.%K%P

0x7C
Where should I go? ―It's at that moment that I see%NHaruka heading towards "Princess Beach". But... she%Nvanishes shortly afterwards, as if she were a mirage...%K%P

0xA4
I start running towards "Princess Beach".%K%P

0x12C
As I walk on Princess Beach, I get the feeling that this%Nplace surrounded by rock is a private beach.%K%P

0x138
Haruka is nowhere to be found. I'm starting to think that it%Nreally was a mirage...%K%P

0x154
No, I see her. I start running again. Standing in the corner%Nof the rock wall is a small, deserted barracks hut.%K%P

0x160
It must have belonged to a fisherman in the past. In front%Nof the hut is a beached, rotten ship. Said fisherman%Nprobably used it to go fishing.%K%P

0x16C
Haruka is sitting on the bow of the ship, firmly staring at%Nthe ocean. Her soft hair sways in the sea breeze.%K%P

0x178
I'm unable to move, as if my soul had been drained from%Nmy body. It feels like someone's telling me that I mustn't%Nget any closer.%K%P

0x184
Haruka suddenly looks this way. Our eyes meet. I try to%Nsay something.%K%P

0x190
―I can't. My throat has become parched.%K%P

0x1C0
Haruka「... Why?」%K%P

0x1CC
Makoto「...」%K%P

0x1D8
Haruka「Why are you here?」%K%P

0x1E4
Makoto「I don't really know...」%K%P

0x1F0
Haruka「Why?」%K%P

0x1FC
As I gaze into Haruka's large eyes, I can neither answer%Nher nor move.%K

0xD38
Attempt to put my feelings into words.

0xD44
Lie with: "I also wanted to see the ocean."

0x244
Makoto「That's... that is, you, um...」%K%P

0x250
Haruka「You?」%K%P

0x25C
Makoto「Well, by 'you'... I meant-」%K%P

0x268
Haruka「Meant what?」%K%P

0x274
Makoto「No, it's just, I came chasing after you, didn't I? That's%Nwhat I meant by 'you'.」%K%P

0x280
Haruka「I don't understand.」%K%P

0x28C
Makoto「I don't get it myself either.」%K%P

0x298
I honestly don't. As if trying to dodge her question, I%Nlaugh, but Haruka doesn't even try to smile.%K%P

0x2A4
Haruka「It doesn't matter...」%K%P

0x2B0
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x2BC
Haruka「You didn't need to look for me... Because I'm different...」%K%P

0x2C8
Makoto「'Different'...」%K%P

0x2D4
Haruka「Because I'm different, it's fine...」%K%P

0x2E8
Makoto「What do you mean, 'fine'...?」%K%P

0x2FC
Makoto「Because I also wanted to see the ocean.」%K%P

0x308
I instantly say the first words that come to mind.%K%P

0x314
I wanted to see the ocean? Me? ... That's complete%Nbullshit.%K%P

0x320
Then what was the real reason?%K%P

0x32C
I don't understand that either.%K%P

0x338
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x344
Haruka says nothing.%K%P

0x358
She suddenly turns away from me, and looks out%Ntowards the ocean.%K%P

0x364
Did she figure out that it was a lie...?%K%P

0x378
As she begins to walk out towards the ocean, I call out%Nto her.%K%P

0x384
Makoto「Ah... W-Wait...」%K%P

0x3A0
Just as I'm about to continue speaking, I hear Yuka and%NOkuhiko's voices in the distance.%K%P

0x3AC
Yuka「Makoto! Haruka! Where are you...!?」%K%P

0x3B8
Okuhiko「Haruka-chan...!」%K%P

0x3E0
I turn around to find small human figures walking down the%Ncoastline road.%K%P

0x3EC
Makoto「Hey! Over here! O...!」%K%P

0x3F8
Just as I raise my hand to wave, my mouth is covered%Nfrom behind. I cock my head in puzzlement.%K%P

0x40C
It's Haruka. Before I knew it, Haruka had come up behind%Nme!%K%P

0x418
Makoto「Mmgh... umph...!」%K%P

0x42C
Haruka「Don't move.」%K%P

0x438
She's covering my mouth with incredible strength. Her%Nglare is piercing me.%K%P

0x44C
Haruka「Can you be quiet?」%K%P

0x458
All I can do is nod. I clumsily nod countless times.%K%P

0x464
Satisfied, Haruka lets go. Phew! As I take a deep breath,%Nshe quickly grabs my hand and jerks me along.%K%P

0x470
Makoto「―!」%K%P

0x47C
Haruka「Come on.」%K%P

0x49C
Yuka and Okuhiko's voices are getting closer. Haruka%Nswiftly climbs up the wrecked ship.%K%P

0x4A8
She drags me towards the deck. I exclaim in surprise as I%Nboard the ship.%K%P

0x4B4
The cabin in the center of the deck looks like a mess,%Nworn down by years of decay and neglect.%K%P

0x4C0
Despite the danger, Haruka enters the cabin. I frantically%Nchase after her.%K%P

0x524
It's pleasantly cool inside the cabin. On the tattered%Nwalls, I see several bugs here and there crawling%Nthrough gaping holes that allow me to see outside. A%Nsea roach enters the room.%K%P

0x538
Haruka is staring at it. For some reason, her face%Nbrightens up. Does she like those things?%K

0xD50
Nah, that can't be...

0xD5C
Bluntly ask her, "Do you like them?"

0x578
Nah, that can't be...%K%P

0x584
I don't understand what she finds so fascinating about%Nthem.%K%P

0x590
Maybe she doesn't actually like sea roaches,%K%N

0x59C
but is perhaps studying them for scientific purposes.%K%P

0x5A8
Maybe she intends to write a thesis about the ecology%Nof sea roaches in the future...%K%P

0x5B4
Yeah, that's right. It must be that.%K%P

0x5C0
That's why she's observing it so intently.%K%P

0x5CC
Makoto「... Hey, how's your research going?」%K%P

0x5D8
I try casually asking her about it.%K%P

0x5EC
Haruka「... Research?」%K%P

0x5F8
She looks at me with a bewildered expression.%K%P

0x604
Huh? I-I was wrong!?%K%P

0x620
Makoto「Do you like them?」%K%P

0x62C
I try asking her.%K%P

0x638
Haruka nods.%K%P

0x644
Huh? Why sea roaches, of all things...?%K%P

0x650
I can't understand Haruka's tastes.%K%P

0x65C
Makoto「Well, what part about them do you like?」%K%P

0x668
Haruka「...」%K%P

0x674
Haruka「Because it's the first time I've seen one.」%K%P

0x680
... That just confuses me even more.%K%P

0x68C
It's not what she said, but rather her logic,%K

0x698
which is like that of a kindergartener.%K%P

0x6A4
They're always excited over things they have never%Nseen before, particularly extraordinary things.%K%N

0x6B0
That's probably why she doesn't find them revolting.%K%P

0x6BC
Makoto「Just like earthworms, or atractylodes...」%K%P

0x6D0
Haruka「...?」%K%P

0x6DC
Makoto「They're all living... aren't they...?」%K%P

0x6E8
I have no clue why I just said that.%K%P

0x6FC
However, Haruka quietly nods, as if she understands me.%K%P

0x760
Soon, we hear Yuka and Okuhiko's voices and footsteps%Napproach us.%K%P

0x76C
Okuhiko「I don't think they went to a dreary place like this.」%K%P

0x778
Yuka「Geez, I wonder if Makoto's found Haruka yet?」%K%P

0x784
Okuhiko「It was a mistake to leave it to Ishihara.」%K%P

0x790
Yuka「Makoto's just spacing out.」%K%P

0x79C
Damn you, Yuka... Don't talk about people behind their%Nbacks! Don't just agree with whatever Okuhiko says%Neither! And why the hell are you saying my name without%Nany honorifics...%K%P

0x7A8
―Huh?? Yuka??%K%P

0x7B4
(Come to think of it, I've just been calling her "Yuka"%Nwithout any honorifics either!)%K%P

0x7C0
Thinking about it carefully, I realize that it hasn't just%Nbeen Yuka. I've been addressing Haruka and Okuhiko%Nwithout any honorifics either, haven't I?%K%P

0x7CC
(Why's that...? And in the first place, isn't it weird that I%Ndidn't notice this straight from the get-go?)%K%P

0x7D8
Haruka places her hand on my shoulder, jolting me away%Nfrom my thoughts.%K%P

0x7EC
Haruka「It seems they've gone.」%K%P

0x814
I can no longer hear Yuka or Okuhiko's voices anymore. I%Ncan't feel their presences either.%K%P

0x828
When I nod, Haruka gets out of the cabin.%K Taking a deep%Nbreath, I follow after her.%K%P

0x860
As I exit outside, I see Haruka jumping off the ship. Sand%Nflies around her clothes.%K%P

0x86C
Just like that, Haruka walks towards the ocean.%K%N

0x878
She doesn't even brush the sand off. She kicks off her%Nshoes as if she intends to completely strip to go%Nswimming.%K%P

0x8A8
I dumbfoundedly watch her. She does it so naturally, as%Nif it required no second thought...%K%P

0x8B4
Makoto「Haruka!」%K%P

0x8DC
Taken aback as I notice this, I shout. Haruka quickly%Nturns around.%K%P

0x8E8
I jump off the wrecked ship and run over to her.%K Even%Nthough I've caught her attention, I realize that I have%Nnothing to say.%K%P

0x8F4
Haruka「What?」%K%P

0x900
Makoto「N-No, it's just, you...」%K%P

0x90C
"Were you planning to strip?" There's no way I can say%Nsomething like that.%K%P

0x918
Haruka「Did you think I was going to strip naked?」%K%P

0x924
Makoto「... N-No way.」%K%P

0x930
Having been seen right through, I try to fake another%Nclumsy laugh. As expected, Haruka doesn't react.%K%P

0x93C
Instead, her eyes are fixed on the faraway horizon as%Nshe dips her feet in the water.%K%P

0x948
Makoto「Anyway, I wanted to ask... why you ran away from Yuka%Nand Okuhiko.」%K%P

0x954
Haruka「I prefer being alone...」%K%P

0x960
Makoto「Huh? Even though you say that, we're at this camp...%NThere's no point in isolating yourself. Besides, aren't%Nyou lonely?」%K%P

0x96C
Haruka「Lonely? Why?」%K%P

0x978
Makoto「Even if you say 'why', being alone is just...」%K%P

0x984
Haruka「I don't understand...」%K%P

0x990
Makoto「Huh?」%K%P

0x99C
Haruka「Because I... am nothing.」%K%P

0x9A8
Makoto「What?」%K%P

0x9B4
Haruka「Because I have no heart...」%K%P

0x9C0
Makoto「Come again?」%K%P

0x9CC
Haruka「Because I have no heart... I don't understand.」%K%P

0x9E0
Makoto「??」%K%P

0x9EC
Haruka walks away without even looking at me...%K%P

0x9F8
What was that? I don't get it at all. "I have no heart"?%NWhat is she saying?%K%P

0xA04
Though I want to ask her more about it, I swallow my%Nwords.%K%P

0xA10
My eyes are completely captivated by the sight of%NHaruka walking down the beach.%K%P

0xA1C
The atmosphere is unworldly...%K%P

0xA28
The waves go in and out, striking Haruka's nearly%Ntransparent bare feet rhythmically. Haruka's legs shine%Nas they are bathed by the sunlight.%K%P

0xA34
The wind plays with her hair and gently caresses my%Nface.%K

0xA40
A wild fancy strikes me. ... Is she not human? Did she%Ncome from the bottom of the ocean? Or is she someone%Nfrom a different planet or another dimension? Nah, no%Nway...%K%P

0xA94
―I wonder how long I've been watching Haruka?%K%P

0xAA0
Until Haruka leaves Princess Beach, it's as if my soul was%Ndrained from my body.%K%P

0xAAC
As I notice Haruka going far off into the distance, I panic%Nand chase after her.%K%P

0xB14
At the same time I catch up to Haruka, I see Yuka and%NOkuhiko heading towards us from the other side.%K%P

0xB44
Yuka「Ah, found you. Just where did you go? Geez...」%K%P

0xB58
She tells us that they went looking for us, but came back%Nafter searching Moon Beach.%K%P

0xB64
Because they didn't find us, she said they'd decided to%Nwait back at the lodge.%K%P

0xB70
I quickly come up with a quick excuse and then I say...%N"We've finally met up here, so we don't need to go back%Nto the lodge"... so the four of us decide to leave for the%Nshopping district.%K%P

0xB7C
Well, considering how deserted that district is, 'leave for'%Nmight not be the best way to put it...%K%P
