#PARAGRAPHS_TRANSLATED:
#EN#1
A school of thought in classical philosophy. With human cognizance being highly subjective and relative, it is very unlikely that everything one perceives is absolutely true.%N
Therefore, all things should be viewed with doubt initially; final judgments on anything, e.g. new information, should be suspended until it has been thoroughly investigated and proven to be veracious.%N
This is skepticism.
