For Developers
-----------

This project is a bunch of scripts and programs in bash, python and C. Python and C programs unpack and repack game resources, decode text, fonts etc. Shell scripts automate the process of applying the translation. They should should work both on macos and linux.

For the full run:

1. Put your ISO at `iso/Never7-jap.iso`, `iso/Ever17-jap.iso`, or `iso/Remember11-jap.iso`

2. Set the `GAME` environment variable to `n7`, `e17`, or `r11`, depending on the game you are patching. Example: `export GAME=e17`

3. Set the `TL_SUFFIX` environment variable to `en`, `cn`, or `ru`. Language support varies by game.

4. Run `./make.sh`

5. The resulting iso will be in the `iso` folder.

`./generate-patches.sh` can be used to generate xdelta3 diff files.

`./generate-eboot-pbp.sh` can generate a EBOOT.PBP file that runs on OFW.

For further details, read the contents of shell scripts (and other source files).

##### Dependencies:

The following tools should be available in your PATH:

`7z mkisofs gcc python3 xdelta3`

The `pillow` python module should be installed, either via pip or your distro's package manager.

- `mkisofs` is a part of the `cdrtools` package.

- Brew command for macos to install dependencies: `brew install cdrtools python3 xdelta`.

- Last tested to be working with python 3.12, will likely work with later versions as well.
