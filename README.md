For Developers
-----------

This project is a bunch of scripts and programs in bash, python and C. Python and C programs unpack and repack game resources, decode text, fonts etc. Shell scripts automate the process of applying the translation. They should should work both on macos and linux.

For the full run

1. Put the Never7 iso at `iso/Never7-jap.iso`

2. Run `./release.sh`

3. Result iso will be at `iso/n7-repacked.iso`

`./generate-patch.sh` can be used to generate an xdelta3 diff file.

For further details, read the content of shell scripts (and other source files).

##### Dependencies:

The following tools should be available in your PATH:

`7z mkisofs gcc python3 xdelta3`

- `mkisofs` is a part of `cdrtools` package - google it.

- Brew command for macos to install dependencies: `brew install p7zip cdrtools python3`.

- Last tested to be working with python 3.12, will likely work with later versions too.
